IN
FALSE
GAZE
WHEN
WE
CONSIDER
THE
IMPORTANCY
OF

TO
THE
TURK
AND
LET
OURSELVES
AGAIN
BUT
UNDERSTAND
THAT
AS
IT
MORE
CONCERNS
THE
TURK
THAN
RHODES
SO
MAY
HE
WITH
MORE
FACILE
QUESTION
BEAR
IT
FOR
THAT
IT
STANDS
NOT
IN
SUCH
WARLIKE
BRACE
BUT
ALTOGETHER
LACKS
THE
ABILITIES
THAT
RHODES
IS
DRESS'D
IN
IF
WE
MAKE
THOUGHT
OF
THIS
WE
MUST
NOT
THINK
THE
TURK
IS
SO
UNSKILFUL
TO
LEAVE
THAT
LATEST
WHICH
CONCERNS
HIM
FIRST
NEGLECTING
AN
ATTEMPT
OF
EASE

A

PROFITLESS
NAY

MOST
POTENT
GRAVE

REVEREND
SIGNIORS
MY
VERY
NOBLE
AND
APPROVED
GOOD
MASTERS
THAT
I
HAVE
TA'EN
AWAY
THIS
OLD
MAN'S
DAUGHTER
IT
IS
MOST
TRUE
TRUE
I
HAVE
MARRIED
HER
THE
VERY
HEAD
AND
FRONT
OF
MY
OFFENDING
HATH
THIS
EXTENT
NO
MORE
RUDE
AM
I
IN
MY
SPEECH
AND
LITTLE
BLESS'D
WITH
THE
SOFT
PHRASE
OF
PEACE
FOR
SINCE
THESE
ARMS
OF
MINE
HAD
SEVEN
YEARS'
PITH
TILL
NOW
SOME
NINE
MOONS
WASTED
THEY
HAVE
USED
THEIR
DEAREST
ACTION
IN
THE
TENTED
FIELD
AND
LITTLE
OF
THIS
GREAT
WORLD
CAN
I
SPEAK
MORE
THAN
PERTAINS
TO
FEATS
OF
BROIL
AND
BATTLE
AND
THEREFORE
LITTLE
SHALL
I
GRACE
MY
CAUSE
IN
SPEAKING
FOR
MYSELF
YET
BY
YOUR
GRACIOUS
PATIENCE
I
WILL
A
ROUND
UNVARNISH'D
TALE
DELIVER
OF
MY
WHOLE
COURSE
OF
LOVE
WHAT
DRUGS
WHAT
CHARMS
WHAT
CONJURATION
AND
WHAT
MIGHTY
MAGIC
FOR
SUCH
PROCEEDING
I
AM
CHARGED
WITHAL
I
WON
HIS
DAUGHTER
A
MAIDEN
NEVER
BOLD
OF
SPIRIT
SO
STILL
AND
QUIET
THAT
HER
MOTION
BLUSH'D
AT
HERSELF
AND
SHE
IN
SPITE
OF
NATURE
OF
YEARS
OF
COUNTRY
CREDIT
EVERY
THING
TO
FALL
IN
LOVE
WITH
WHAT
SHE
FEAR'D
TO
LOOK
ON
IT
IS
A
JUDGMENT
MAIM'D
AND
MOST
IMPERFECT
THAT
WILL
CONFESS
PERFECTION
SO
COULD
ERR
AGAINST
ALL
RULES
OF
NATURE
AND
MUST
BE
DRIVEN
TO
FIND
OUT
PRACTISES
OF
CUNNING
HELL
WHY
THIS
SHOULD
BE
I
THEREFORE
VOUCH
AGAIN
THAT
WITH
SOME
MIXTURES
POWERFUL
O'ER
THE
BLOOD
OR
WITH
SOME
DRAM
CONJURED
TO
THIS
EFFECT
HE
WROUGHT
UPON
HER
TO
VOUCH
THIS
IS
NO
PROOF
WITHOUT
MORE
WIDER
AND
MORE
OVERT
TEST
THAN
THESE
THIN
HABITS
AND
POOR
LIKELIHOODS
OF
MODERN
SEEMING
DO
PREFER
AGAINST
HIM
BUT
OTHELLO
SPEAK
DID
YOU
BY
INDIRECT
AND
FORCED
COURSES
SUBDUE
AND
POISON
THIS
YOUNG
MAID'S
AFFECTIONS
OR
CAME
IT
BY
REQUEST
AND
SUCH
FAIR
QUESTION
AS
SOUL
TO
SOUL
AFFORDETH
I
DO
BESEECH
YOU
SEND
FOR
THE
LADY
TO
THE
SAGITTARY
AND
LET
HER
SPEAK
OF
ME
BEFORE
HER
FATHER
IF
YOU
DO
FIND
ME
FOUL
IN
HER
REPORT
THE
TRUST
THE
OFFICE
I
DO
HOLD
OF
YOU
NOT
ONLY
TAKE
AWAY
BUT
LET
YOUR
SENTENCE
EVEN
FALL
UPON
MY
LIFE
FETCH
DESDEMONA
HITHER
ANCIENT
CONDUCT
THEM
YOU
BEST
KNOW
THE
PLACE
AND
TILL
SHE
COME
AS
TRULY
AS
TO
HEAVEN
I
DO
CONFESS
THE
VICES
OF
MY
BLOOD
SO
JUSTLY
TO
YOUR
GRAVE
EARS
I'LL
PRESENT
HOW
I
DID
THRIVE
IN
THIS
FAIR
LADY'S
LOVE
AND
SHE
IN
MINE
SAY
IT
OTHELLO
HER
FATHER
LOVED
ME
OFT
INVITED
ME
STILL
QUESTION'D
ME
THE
STORY
OF
MY
LIFE
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
THE
BATTLES
SIEGES
FORTUNES
THAT
I
HAVE
PASSED
I
RAN
IT
THROUGH
EVEN
FROM
MY
BOYISH
DAYS
TO
THE
VERY
MOMENT
THAT
HE
BADE
ME
TELL
IT
WHEREIN
I
SPAKE
OF
MOST
DISASTROUS
CHANCES
OF
MOVING
ACCIDENTS
BY
FLOOD
AND
FIELD
OF
HAIR-BREADTH
SCAPES
I'
THE
IMMINENT
DEADLY
BREACH
OF
BEING
TAKEN
BY
THE
INSOLENT
FOE
AND
SOLD
TO
SLAVERY
OF
MY
REDEMPTION
THENCE
AND
PORTANCE
IN
MY
TRAVELS'
HISTORY
WHEREIN
OF
ANTRES
VAST
AND
DESERTS
IDLE
ROUGH
QUARRIES
ROCKS
AND
HILLS
WHOSE
HEADS
TOUCH
HEAVEN
IT
WAS
MY
HINT
TO
SPEAK
SUCH
WAS
THE
PROCESS
AND
OF
THE
CANNIBALS
THAT
EACH
OTHER
EAT
THE
ANTHROPOPHAGI
AND
MEN
WHOSE
HEADS
DO
GROW
BENEATH
THEIR
SHOULDERS
THIS
TO
HEAR
WOULD
DESDEMONA
SERIOUSLY
INCLINE
BUT
STILL
THE
HOUSE-AFFAIRS
WOULD
DRAW
HER
THENCE
WHICH
EVER
AS
SHE
COULD
WITH
HASTE
DISPATCH
SHE'LD
COME
AGAIN
AND
WITH
A
GREEDY
EAR
DEVOUR
UP
MY
DISCOURSE
WHICH
I
OBSERVING
TOOK
ONCE
A
PLIANT
HOUR
AND
FOUND
GOOD
MEANS
TO
DRAW
FROM
HER
A
PRAYER
OF
EARNEST
HEART
THAT
I
WOULD
ALL
MY
PILGRIMAGE
DILATE
WHEREOF
BY
PARCELS
SHE
HAD
SOMETHING
HEARD
BUT
NOT
INTENTIVELY
I
DID
CONSENT
AND
OFTEN
DID
BEGUILE
HER
OF
HER
TEARS
WHEN
I
DID
SPEAK
OF
SOME
DISTRESSFUL
STROKE
THAT
MY
YOUTH
SUFFER'D
MY
STORY
BEING
DONE
SHE
GAVE
ME
FOR
MY
PAINS
A
WORLD
OF
SIGHS
SHE
SWORE
IN
FAITH
TWAS
STRANGE
'TWAS
PASSING
STRANGE
'TWAS
PITIFUL
'TWAS
WONDROUS
PITIFUL
SHE
WISH'D
SHE
HAD
NOT
HEARD
IT
YET
SHE
WISH'D
THAT
HEAVEN
HAD
MADE
HER
SUCH
A
MAN
SHE
THANK'D
ME
AND
BADE
ME
IF
I
HAD
A
FRIEND
THAT
LOVED
HER
I
SHOULD
BUT
TEACH
HIM
HOW
TO
TELL
MY
STORY
AND
THAT
WOULD
WOO
HER
UPON
THIS
HINT
I
SPAKE
SHE
LOVED
ME
FOR
THE
DANGERS
I
HAD
PASS'D
AND
I
LOVED
HER
THAT
SHE
DID
PITY
THEM
THIS
ONLY
IS
THE
WITCHCRAFT
I
HAVE
USED
HERE
COMES
THE
LADY
LET
HER
WITNESS
IT
I
THINK
THIS
TALE
WOULD
WIN
MY
DAUGHTER
TOO
GOOD
BRABANTIO
TAKE
UP
THIS
MANGLED
MATTER
AT
THE
BEST
MEN
DO
THEIR
BROKEN
WEAPONS
RATHER
USE
THAN
THEIR
BARE
HANDS
I
PRAY
YOU
HEAR
HER
SPEAK
IF
SHE
CONFESS
THAT
SHE
WAS
HALF
THE
WOOER
DESTRUCTION
ON
MY
HEAD
IF
MY
BAD
BLAME
LIGHT
ON
THE
MAN
COME
HITHER
GENTLE
MISTRESS
DO

PERCEIVE
IN
ALL
THIS
NOBLE
COMPANY
WHERE

HERE
DO
GIVE
THEE
THAT
WITH
ALL
MY

I
WOULD
KEEP
FROM

FOR
YOUR
SAKE
JEWEL
I
AM
GLAD

TYRANNY
TO
HANG
CLOGS
ON
THEM
I
HAVE
DONE
MY
LORD
LET
ME
SPEAK
LIKE
YOURSELF
AND
LAY
A
SENTENCE
WHICH
AS
A
GRISE
OR
STEP
MAY
HELP
THESE
LOVERS
INTO
YOUR
FAVOUR
WHEN
REMEDIES
ARE
PAST
THE
GRIEFS
ARE
ENDED
BY
SEEING
THE
WORST
WHICH
LATE
ON
HOPES
DEPENDED
TO
MOURN
A
MISCHIEF
THAT
IS
PAST
AND
GONE
IS
THE
NEXT
WAY
TO
DRAW
NEW
MISCHIEF
ON
WHAT
CANNOT
BE
PRESERVED
WHEN
FORTUNE
TAKES
PATIENCE
HER
INJURY
A
MOCKERY
MAKES
THE
ROBB'D
THAT
SMILES
STEALS
SOMETHING
FROM
THE
THIEF
HE
ROBS
HIMSELF
THAT
SPENDS
A
BOOTLESS
GRIEF
SO
LET
THE
TURK
OF
CYPRUS
US
BEGUILE
WE
LOSE
IT
NOT
SO
LONG
AS
WE
CAN
SMILE
HE
BEARS
THE
SENTENCE
WELL
THAT
NOTHING
BEARS
BUT
THE
FREE
COMFORT
WHICH
FROM
THENCE
HE
HEARS
BUT
HE
BEARS
BOTH
THE
SENTENCE
AND
THE
SORROW
THAT
TO
PAY
GRIEF
MUST
OF
POOR
PATIENCE
BORROW
THESE
SENTENCES
TO
SUGAR
OR
TO
GALL
BEING
STRONG
ON
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
EQUIVOCAL
BUT

PREPOSTEROUS
CONCLUSIONS

WE
HAVE
REASON
TO
COOL
OUR
RAGING
MOTIONS
OUR
CARNAL
STINGS
OUR
UNBITTED
LUSTS
WHEREOF
I
TAKE
THIS
THAT
YOU
CALL
LOVE
TO
BE
A
SECT
OR
SCION
IT
CANNOT
BE
IT
IS
MERELY
A
LUST
OF

A
PERMISSION
OF

COME
BE
A

DROWN
THYSELF
DROWN
CATS

PUPPIES
I
HAVE
PROFESSED

OF
PERDURABLE
TOUGHNESS

FILL
THY

THEREFORE
PUT

SHE
HOLDS
IT
A

I
GIVE
AND
HONEST
PROBAL
TO
THINKING
AND
INDEED
THE
COURSE
TO
WIN
THE

AGAIN
FOR
'TIS
MOST
EASY
THE
INCLINING
DESDEMONA
TO
SUBDUE
IN
ANY
HONEST
SUIT
SHE'S
FRAMED
AS
FRUITFUL
AS
THE
FREE
ELEMENTS
AND
THEN
FOR
HER
TO
WIN
THE
MOOR
WERE'T
TO
RENOUNCE
HIS
BAPTISM
ALL
SEALS
AND
SYMBOLS
OF
REDEEMED
SIN
HIS
SOUL
IS
SO
ENFETTER'D
TO

UNMAKE
DO
WHAT

SHE
STRIVES
TO
DO

PROOF
HER
NAME
THAT
WAS
AS
FRESH
AS
DIAN'S
VISAGE
IS
NOW
BEGRIMED
AND
BLACK
AS
MINE
OWN
FACE
IF
THERE

CORDS
OR
KNIVES
POISON
OR
FIRE
OR
SUFFOCATING
STREAMS
I'LL
NOT
ENDURE

AND
FOOLS
AS
GROSS
AS
IGNORANCE
MADE
DRUNK

YET
I
SAY
IF
IMPUTATION
AND
STRONG
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH
LEAD
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
DOOR
OF

WILL
GIVE
YOU
SATISFACTION
YOU
MAY
HAVE'T

UNHATCH'D
PRACTISE
MADE
DEMONSTRABLE
HERE
IN

WRANGLE
WITH
INFERIOR

DO
FALL
SAY
THAT
THEY
SLACK
THEIR
DUTIES
AND
POUR
OUR
TREASURES
