ATER THE DEATH OF JOSHUA

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL INQUIRED OF THE LORD

WHO SHALL GO UP FIRST FOR US AGAINST THE CANAANITES

TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM



THE LORD SAID JUDAH SHALL GO UP; BEHOLD

I HAVE GIVEN THE LAND INTO HIS HAND



AND JUDAH SAID TO SIMEON HIS BROTHER

COME UP WITH ME INTO THE TERRITORY ALLOTTED TO ME

THAT WE MAY FIGHT AGAINST THE CANAANITES

AND I LIKEWISE WILL GO WITH YOU INTO

THE TERRITORY ALLOTTED TO YOU



SO SIMEON WENT WITH HIM

THEN JUDAH WENT

UP AND THE LORD GAVE THE CANAANITES AND THE PERIZZITES INTO THEIR HAND AND THEY DEFEATED  OF THEM AT BEZEK

THEY FOUND ADONIBEZEK AT BEZEK AND FOUGHT AGAINST HIM AND DEFEATED THE CANAANITES AND THE PERIZZITES

ADONIBEZEK FLED BUT THEY PURSUED HIM AND CAUGHT HIM AND CUT OFF HIS THUMBS AND HIS BIG TOES

AND ADONIBEZEK SAID SEVENTY KINGS WITH THEIR THUMBS AND THEIR BIG TOES CUT OFF USED TO PICK UP SCRAPS UNDER MY TABLE

AS I HAVE DONE SO GOD HAS REPAID ME

 AND THEY BROUGHT HIM TO JERUSALEM AND HE DIED THERE

AND THE MEN OF JUDAH FOUGHT AGAINST JERUSALEM AND CAPTURED IT AND STRUCK IT WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND SET THE CITY ON FIRE

AND AFTERWARD THE MEN OF JUDAH WENT DOWN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN THE HILL COUNTRY IN THE NEGEB AND IN THE LOWLAND

AND JUDAH WENT AGAINST THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN HEBRON NOW THE NAME OF HEBRON WAS FORMERLY KIRIATHARBA AND THEY DEFEATED SHESHAI AND AHIMAN AND TALMAI

FROM THERE THEY WENT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF DEBIR

THE NAME OF DEBIR WAS FORMERLY KIRIATHSEPHER

AND CALEB SAID HE WHO ATTACKS KIRIATHSEPHER AND CAPTURES IT I WILL GIVE HIM ACHSAH MY DAUGHTER FOR A WIFE

 AND OTHNIEL THE SON OF KENAZ CALEB'S YOUNGER BROTHER CAPTURED IT

AND HE GAVE HIM ACHSAH HIS DAUGHTER FOR A WIFE

WHEN SHE CAME TO HIM SHE URGED HIM TO ASK HER FATHER FOR A FIELD

AND SHE DISMOUNTED FROM HER DONKEY AND CALEB SAID TO HER WHAT DO YOU WANT

 SHE SAID TO HIM GIVE ME A BLESSING

SINCE YOU HAVE SET ME IN THE LAND OF THE NEGEB GIVE ME ALSO SPRINGS OF WATER

 AND CALEB GAVE HER THE UPPER SPRINGS AND THE LOWER SPRINGS

AND THE DESCENDANTS OF THE KENITE MOSES' FATHERINLAW WENT UP WITH THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH FROM THE CITY OF PALMS INTO THE WILDERNESS OF JUDAH WHICH LIES IN THE NEGEB NEAR ARAD AND THEY WENT AND SETTLED WITH THE PEOPLE

AND JUDAH WENT WITH SIMEON HIS BROTHER AND THEY DEFEATED THE CANAANITES WHO INHABITED ZEPHATH AND DEVOTED IT TO DESTRUCTION

SO THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS CALLED HORMAH

JUDAH ALSO CAPTURED GAZA WITH ITS TERRITORY AND ASHKELON WITH ITS TERRITORY AND EKRON WITH ITS TERRITORY

AND THE LORD WAS WITH JUDAH AND HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE HILL COUNTRY BUT HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF THE PLAIN BECAUSE THEY HAD CHARIOTS OF IRON

AND HEBRON WAS GIVEN TO CALEB AS MOSES HAD SAID

AND HE DROVE OUT FROM IT THE THREE SONS OF ANAK

BUT THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE JEBUSITES WHO LIVED IN JERUSALEM SO THE JEBUSITES HAVE LIVED WITH THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN IN JERUSALEM TO THIS DAY

THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH ALSO WENT UP AGAINST BETHEL AND THE LORD WAS WITH THEM

AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH SCOUTED OUT BETHEL

NOW THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS FORMERLY LUZ

 AND THE SPIES SAW A MAN COMING OUT OF THE CITY AND THEY SAID TO HIM PLEASE SHOW US THE WAY INTO THE CITY AND WE WILL DEAL KINDLY WITH YOU

 AND HE SHOWED THEM THE WAY INTO THE CITY

AND THEY STRUCK THE CITY WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD BUT THEY LET THE MAN AND ALL HIS FAMILY GO

AND THE MAN WENT TO THE LAND OF THE HITTITES AND BUILT A CITY AND CALLED ITS NAME LUZ

THAT IS ITS NAME TO THIS DAY

MANASSEH DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF BETHSHEAN AND ITS VILLAGES OR TAANACH AND ITS VILLAGES OR THE INHABITANTS OF DOR AND ITS VILLAGES OR THE INHABITANTS OF IBLEAM AND ITS VILLAGES OR THE INHABITANTS OF MEGIDDO AND ITS VILLAGES FOR THE CANAANITES PERSISTED IN DWELLING IN THAT LAND

WHEN ISRAEL GREW STRONG THEY PUT THE CANAANITES TO FORCED LABOR BUT DID NOT DRIVE THEM OUT COMPLETELY

AND EPHRAIM DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN GEZER SO THE CANAANITES LIVED IN GEZER AMONG THEM

ZEBULUN DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF KITRON OR THE INHABITANTS OF NAHALOL SO THE CANAANITES LIVED AMONG THEM BUT BECAME SUBJECT TO FORCED LABOR

ASHER DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF ACCO OR THE INHABITANTS OF SIDON OR OF AHLAB OR OF ACHZIB OR OF HELBAH OR OF APHIK OR OF REHOB SO THE ASHERITES LIVED AMONG THE CANAANITES THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND FOR THEY DID NOT DRIVE THEM OUT

NAPHTALI DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF BETHSHEMESH OR THE INHABITANTS OF BETHANATH SO THEY LIVED AMONG THE CANAANITES THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

NEVERTHELESS THE INHABITANTS OF BETHSHEMESH AND OF BETHANATH BECAME SUBJECT TO FORCED LABOR FOR THEM

THE AMORITES PRESSED THE PEOPLE OF DAN BACK INTO THE HILL COUNTRY FOR THEY DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO COME DOWN TO THE PLAIN

THE AMORITES PERSISTED IN DWELLING IN MOUNT HERES IN AIJALON AND IN SHAALBIM BUT THE HAND OF THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH RESTED HEAVILY ON THEM AND THEY BECAME SUBJECT TO FORCED LABOR

AND THE BORDER OF THE AMORITES RAN FROM THE ASCENT OF AKRABBIM FROM SELA AND UPWARD

NOW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT UP FROM GILGAL TO BOCHIM

AND HE SAID I BROUGHT YOU UP FROM EGYPT AND BROUGHT YOU INTO THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS

I SAID 'I WILL NEVER BREAK MY COVENANT WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL MAKE NO COVENANT WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND; YOU SHALL BREAK DOWN THEIR ALTARS

' BUT YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE

WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE

SO NOW I SAY I WILL NOT DRIVE THEM OUT BEFORE YOU BUT THEY SHALL BECOME THORNS IN YOUR SIDES AND THEIR GODS SHALL BE A SNARE TO YOU

 AS SOON AS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SPOKE THESE WORDS TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE PEOPLE LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND WEPT

AND THEY CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE BOCHIM

AND THEY SACRIFICED THERE TO THE LORD

WHEN JOSHUA DISMISSED THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT EACH TO HIS INHERITANCE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND

AND THE PEOPLE SERVED THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF JOSHUA AND ALL THE DAYS OF THE ELDERS WHO OUTLIVED JOSHUA WHO HAD SEEN ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT THE LORD HAD DONE FOR ISRAEL

AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED AT THE AGE OF  YEARS

AND THEY BURIED HIM WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF HIS INHERITANCE IN TIMNATHHERES IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM NORTH OF THE MOUNTAIN OF GAASH

AND ALL THAT GENERATION ALSO WERE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS

AND THERE AROSE ANOTHER GENERATION AFTER THEM WHO DID NOT KNOW THE LORD OR THE WORK THAT HE HAD DONE FOR ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND SERVED THE BAALS

AND THEY ABANDONED THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

THEY WENT AFTER OTHER GODS FROM AMONG THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES WHO WERE AROUND THEM AND BOWED DOWN TO THEM

AND THEY PROVOKED THE LORD TO ANGER

THEY ABANDONED THE LORD AND SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASHTAROTH

SO THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE GAVE THEM OVER TO PLUNDERERS WHO PLUNDERED THEM

AND HE SOLD THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR SURROUNDING ENEMIES SO THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER WITHSTAND THEIR ENEMIES

WHENEVER THEY MARCHED OUT THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS AGAINST THEM FOR HARM AS THE LORD HAD WARNED AND AS THE LORD HAD SWORN TO THEM

AND THEY WERE IN TERRIBLE DISTRESS

THEN THE LORD RAISED UP JUDGES WHO SAVED THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THOSE WHO PLUNDERED THEM

YET THEY DID NOT LISTEN TO THEIR JUDGES FOR THEY WHORED AFTER OTHER GODS AND BOWED DOWN TO THEM

THEY SOON TURNED ASIDE FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR FATHERS HAD WALKED WHO HAD OBEYED THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD AND THEY DID NOT DO SO

WHENEVER THE LORD RAISED UP JUDGES FOR THEM THE LORD WAS WITH THE JUDGE AND HE SAVED THEM FROM THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES ALL THE DAYS OF THE JUDGE

FOR THE LORD WAS MOVED TO PITY BY THEIR GROANING BECAUSE OF THOSE WHO AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED THEM

BUT WHENEVER THE JUDGE DIED THEY TURNED BACK AND WERE MORE CORRUPT THAN THEIR FATHERS GOING AFTER OTHER GODS SERVING THEM AND BOWING DOWN TO THEM

THEY DID NOT DROP ANY OF THEIR PRACTICES OR THEIR STUBBORN WAYS

SO THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE SAID BECAUSE THIS PEOPLE HAVE TRANSGRESSED MY COVENANT THAT I COMMANDED THEIR FATHERS AND HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE I WILL NO LONGER DRIVE OUT BEFORE THEM ANY OF THE NATIONS THAT JOSHUA LEFT WHEN HE DIED IN ORDER TO TEST ISRAEL BY THEM WHETHER THEY WILL TAKE CARE TO WALK IN THE WAY OF THE LORD AS THEIR FATHERS DID OR NOT

 SO THE LORD LEFT THOSE NATIONS NOT DRIVING THEM OUT QUICKLY AND HE DID NOT GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF JOSHUA

NOW THESE ARE THE NATIONS THAT THE LORD LEFT TO TEST ISRAEL BY THEM THAT IS ALL IN ISRAEL WHO HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ALL THE WARS IN CANAAN

IT WAS ONLY IN ORDER THAT THE GENERATIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MIGHT KNOW WAR TO TEACH WAR TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT KNOWN IT BEFORE

THESE ARE THE NATIONS THE FIVE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES AND ALL THE CANAANITES AND THE SIDONIANS AND THE HIVITES WHO LIVED ON MOUNT LEBANON FROM MOUNT BAALHERMON AS FAR AS LEBOHAMATH

THEY WERE FOR THE TESTING OF ISRAEL TO KNOW WHETHER ISRAEL WOULD OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD WHICH HE COMMANDED THEIR FATHERS BY THE HAND OF MOSES

SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL LIVED AMONG THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES

AND THEIR DAUGHTERS THEY TOOK TO THEMSELVES FOR WIVES AND THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS THEY GAVE TO THEIR SONS AND THEY SERVED THEIR GODS

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

THEY FORGOT THE LORD THEIR GOD AND SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASHEROTH

THEREFORE THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE SOLD THEM INTO THE HAND OF CUSHANRISHATHAIM KING OF MESOPOTAMIA

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SERVED CUSHANRISHATHAIM EIGHT YEARS

BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD THE LORD RAISED UP A DELIVERER FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO SAVED THEM OTHNIEL THE SON OF KENAZ CALEB'S YOUNGER BROTHER

THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WAS UPON HIM AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL

HE WENT OUT TO WAR AND THE LORD GAVE CUSHANRISHATHAIM KING OF MESOPOTAMIA INTO HIS HAND

AND HIS HAND PREVAILED OVER CUSHANRISHATHAIM

SO THE LAND HAD REST FORTY YEARS

THEN OTHNIEL THE SON OF KENAZ DIED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AGAIN DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND THE LORD STRENGTHENED EGLON THE KING OF MOAB AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY HAD DONE WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

HE GATHERED TO HIMSELF THE AMMONITES AND THE AMALEKITES AND WENT AND DEFEATED ISRAEL

AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CITY OF PALMS

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SERVED EGLON THE KING OF MOAB EIGHTEEN YEARS

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD AND THE LORD RAISED UP FOR THEM A DELIVERER EHUD THE SON OF GERA THE BENJAMINITE A LEFTHANDED MAN

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SENT TRIBUTE BY HIM TO EGLON THE KING OF MOAB

AND EHUD MADE FOR HIMSELF A SWORD WITH TWO EDGES A CUBIT IN LENGTH AND HE BOUND IT ON HIS RIGHT THIGH UNDER HIS CLOTHES

AND HE PRESENTED THE TRIBUTE TO EGLON KING OF MOAB

NOW EGLON WAS A VERY FAT MAN

AND WHEN EHUD HAD FINISHED PRESENTING THE TRIBUTE HE SENT AWAY THE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED THE TRIBUTE

BUT HE HIMSELF TURNED BACK AT THE IDOLS NEAR GILGAL AND SAID I HAVE A SECRET MESSAGE FOR YOU O KING

 AND HE COMMANDED SILENCE

 AND ALL HIS ATTENDANTS WENT OUT FROM HIS PRESENCE

AND EHUD CAME TO HIM AS HE WAS SITTING ALONE IN HIS COOL ROOF CHAMBER

AND EHUD SAID I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM GOD FOR YOU

 AND HE AROSE FROM HIS SEAT

AND EHUD REACHED WITH HIS LEFT HAND TOOK THE SWORD FROM HIS RIGHT THIGH AND THRUST IT INTO HIS BELLY

AND THE HILT ALSO WENT IN AFTER THE BLADE AND THE FAT CLOSED OVER THE BLADE FOR HE DID NOT PULL THE SWORD OUT OF HIS BELLY; AND THE DUNG CAME OUT

THEN EHUD WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH AND CLOSED THE DOORS OF THE ROOF CHAMBER BEHIND HIM AND LOCKED THEM

WHEN HE HAD GONE THE SERVANTS CAME AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE DOORS OF THE ROOF CHAMBER WERE LOCKED THEY THOUGHT SURELY HE IS RELIEVING HIMSELF IN THE CLOSET OF THE COOL CHAMBER

 AND THEY WAITED TILL THEY WERE EMBARRASSED

BUT WHEN HE STILL DID NOT OPEN THE DOORS OF THE ROOF CHAMBER THEY TOOK THE KEY AND OPENED THEM AND THERE LAY THEIR LORD DEAD ON THE FLOOR

EHUD ESCAPED WHILE THEY DELAYED AND HE PASSED BEYOND THE IDOLS AND ESCAPED TO SEIRAH

WHEN HE ARRIVED HE SOUNDED THE TRUMPET IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT DOWN WITH HIM FROM THE HILL COUNTRY AND HE WAS THEIR LEADER

AND HE SAID TO THEM FOLLOW AFTER ME FOR THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOUR ENEMIES THE MOABITES INTO YOUR HAND

 SO THEY WENT DOWN AFTER HIM AND SEIZED THE FORDS OF THE JORDAN AGAINST THE MOABITES AND DID NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO PASS OVER

AND THEY KILLED AT THAT TIME ABOUT  OF THE MOABITES ALL STRONG ABLEBODIED MEN; NOT A MAN ESCAPED

SO MOAB WAS SUBDUED THAT DAY UNDER THE HAND OF ISRAEL

AND THE LAND HAD REST FOR EIGHTY YEARS

AFTER HIM WAS SHAMGAR THE SON OF ANATH WHO KILLED  OF THE PHILISTINES WITH AN OXGOAD AND HE ALSO SAVED ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AGAIN DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AFTER EHUD DIED

AND THE LORD SOLD THEM INTO THE HAND OF JABIN KING OF CANAAN WHO REIGNED IN HAZOR

THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY WAS SISERA WHO LIVED IN HAROSHETHHAGOYIM

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD FOR HELP FOR HE HAD  CHARIOTS OF IRON AND HE OPPRESSED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRUELLY FOR TWENTY YEARS

NOW DEBORAH A PROPHETESS THE WIFE OF LAPPIDOTH WAS JUDGING ISRAEL AT THAT TIME

SHE USED TO SIT UNDER THE PALM OF DEBORAH BETWEEN RAMAH AND BETHEL IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME UP TO HER FOR JUDGMENT

SHE SENT AND SUMMONED BARAK THE SON OF ABINOAM FROM KEDESHNAPHTALI AND SAID TO HIM HAS NOT THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL COMMANDED YOU 'GO GATHER YOUR MEN AT MOUNT TABOR TAKING  FROM THE PEOPLE OF NAPHTALI AND THE PEOPLE OF ZEBULUN

AND I WILL DRAW OUT SISERA THE GENERAL OF JABIN'S ARMY TO MEET YOU BY THE RIVER KISHON WITH HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS TROOPS AND I WILL GIVE HIM INTO YOUR HAND'

 BARAK SAID TO HER IF YOU WILL GO WITH ME I WILL GO BUT IF YOU WILL NOT GO WITH ME I WILL NOT GO

 AND SHE SAID I WILL SURELY GO WITH YOU

NEVERTHELESS THE ROAD ON WHICH YOU ARE GOING WILL NOT LEAD TO YOUR GLORY FOR THE LORD WILL SELL SISERA INTO THE HAND OF A WOMAN

 THEN DEBORAH AROSE AND WENT WITH BARAK TO KEDESH

AND BARAK CALLED OUT ZEBULUN AND NAPHTALI TO KEDESH

AND  MEN WENT UP AT HIS HEELS AND DEBORAH WENT UP WITH HIM

NOW HEBER THE KENITE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE KENITES THE DESCENDANTS OF HOBAB THE FATHERINLAW OF MOSES AND HAD PITCHED HIS TENT AS FAR AWAY AS THE OAK IN ZAANANNIM WHICH IS NEAR KEDESH

WHEN SISERA WAS TOLD THAT BARAK THE SON OF ABINOAM HAD GONE UP TO MOUNT TABOR SISERA CALLED OUT ALL HIS CHARIOTS  CHARIOTS OF IRON AND ALL THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM FROM HAROSHETHHAGOYIM TO THE RIVER KISHON

AND DEBORAH SAID TO BARAK UP

FOR THIS IS THE DAY IN WHICH THE LORD HAS GIVEN SISERA INTO YOUR HAND

DOES NOT THE LORD GO OUT BEFORE YOU

 SO BARAK WENT DOWN FROM MOUNT TABOR WITH  MEN FOLLOWING HIM

AND THE LORD ROUTED SISERA AND ALL HIS CHARIOTS AND ALL HIS ARMY BEFORE BARAK BY THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

AND SISERA GOT DOWN FROM HIS CHARIOT AND FLED AWAY ON FOOT

AND BARAK PURSUED THE CHARIOTS AND THE ARMY TO HAROSHETHHAGOYIM AND ALL THE ARMY OF SISERA FELL BY THE EDGE OF THE SWORD; NOT A MAN WAS LEFT

BUT SISERA FLED AWAY ON FOOT TO THE TENT OF JAEL THE WIFE OF HEBER THE KENITE FOR THERE WAS PEACE BETWEEN JABIN THE KING OF HAZOR AND THE HOUSE OF HEBER THE KENITE

AND JAEL CAME OUT TO MEET SISERA AND SAID TO HIM TURN ASIDE MY LORD; TURN ASIDE TO ME; DO NOT BE AFRAID

 SO HE TURNED ASIDE TO HER INTO THE TENT AND SHE COVERED HIM WITH A RUG

AND HE SAID TO HER PLEASE GIVE ME A LITTLE WATER TO DRINK FOR I AM THIRSTY

 SO SHE OPENED A SKIN OF MILK AND GAVE HIM A DRINK AND COVERED HIM

AND HE SAID TO HER STAND AT THE OPENING OF THE TENT AND IF ANY MAN COMES AND ASKS YOU 'IS ANYONE HERE

' SAY 'NO

' BUT JAEL THE WIFE OF HEBER TOOK A TENT PEG AND TOOK A HAMMER IN HER HAND

THEN SHE WENT SOFTLY TO HIM AND DROVE THE PEG INTO HIS TEMPLE UNTIL IT WENT DOWN INTO THE GROUND WHILE HE WAS LYING FAST ASLEEP FROM WEARINESS

SO HE DIED

AND BEHOLD AS BARAK WAS PURSUING SISERA JAEL WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SAID TO HIM COME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE MAN WHOM YOU ARE SEEKING

 SO HE WENT IN TO HER TENT AND THERE LAY SISERA DEAD WITH THE TENT PEG IN HIS TEMPLE

SO ON THAT DAY GOD SUBDUED JABIN THE KING OF CANAAN BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE HAND OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL PRESSED HARDER AND HARDER AGAINST JABIN THE KING OF CANAAN UNTIL THEY DESTROYED JABIN KING OF CANAAN

THEN SANG DEBORAH AND BARAK THE SON OF ABINOAM ON THAT DAY THAT THE LEADERS TOOK THE LEAD IN ISRAEL THAT THE PEOPLE OFFERED THEMSELVES WILLINGLY BLESS THE LORD

HEAR O KINGS; GIVE EAR O PRINCES; TO THE LORD I WILL SING; I WILL MAKE MELODY TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

LORD WHEN YOU WENT OUT FROM SEIR WHEN YOU MARCHED FROM THE REGION OF EDOM THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE HEAVENS DROPPED YES THE CLOUDS DROPPED WATER

THE MOUNTAINS QUAKED BEFORE THE LORD EVEN SINAI BEFORE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

IN THE DAYS OF SHAMGAR SON OF ANATH IN THE DAYS OF JAEL THE HIGHWAYS WERE ABANDONED AND TRAVELERS KEPT TO THE BYWAYS

THE VILLAGERS CEASED IN ISRAEL; THEY CEASED TO BE UNTIL I AROSE; I DEBORAH AROSE AS A MOTHER IN ISRAEL

WHEN NEW GODS WERE CHOSEN THEN WAR WAS IN THE GATES

WAS SHIELD OR SPEAR TO BE SEEN AMONG FORTY THOUSAND IN ISRAEL

MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE COMMANDERS OF ISRAEL WHO OFFERED THEMSELVES WILLINGLY AMONG THE PEOPLE

BLESS THE LORD

TELL OF IT YOU WHO RIDE ON WHITE DONKEYS YOU WHO SIT ON RICH CARPETS AND YOU WHO WALK BY THE WAY

TO THE SOUND OF MUSICIANS AT THE WATERING PLACES THERE THEY REPEAT THE RIGHTEOUS TRIUMPHS OF THE LORD THE RIGHTEOUS TRIUMPHS OF HIS VILLAGERS IN ISRAEL

THEN DOWN TO THE GATES MARCHED THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD

AWAKE AWAKE DEBORAH

AWAKE AWAKE BREAK OUT IN A SONG

ARISE BARAK LEAD AWAY YOUR CAPTIVES O SON OF ABINOAM

THEN DOWN MARCHED THE REMNANT OF THE NOBLE; THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD MARCHED DOWN FOR ME AGAINST THE MIGHTY

FROM EPHRAIM THEIR ROOT THEY MARCHED DOWN INTO THE VALLEY FOLLOWING YOU BENJAMIN WITH YOUR KINSMEN; FROM MACHIR MARCHED DOWN THE COMMANDERS AND FROM ZEBULUN THOSE WHO BEAR THE LIEUTENANT'S STAFF; THE PRINCES OF ISSACHAR CAME WITH DEBORAH AND ISSACHAR FAITHFUL TO BARAK; INTO THE VALLEY THEY RUSHED AT HIS HEELS

AMONG THE CLANS OF REUBEN THERE WERE GREAT SEARCHINGS OF HEART

WHY DID YOU SIT STILL AMONG THE SHEEPFOLDS TO HEAR THE WHISTLING FOR THE FLOCKS

AMONG THE CLANS OF REUBEN THERE WERE GREAT SEARCHINGS OF HEART

GILEAD STAYED BEYOND THE JORDAN; AND DAN WHY DID HE STAY WITH THE SHIPS

ASHER SAT STILL AT THE COAST OF THE SEA STAYING BY HIS LANDINGS

ZEBULUN IS A PEOPLE WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO THE DEATH; NAPHTALI TOO ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE FIELD

THE KINGS CAME THEY FOUGHT; THEN FOUGHT THE KINGS OF CANAAN AT TAANACH BY THE WATERS OF MEGIDDO; THEY GOT NO SPOILS OF SILVER

FROM HEAVEN THE STARS FOUGHT FROM THEIR COURSES THEY FOUGHT AGAINST SISERA

THE TORRENT KISHON SWEPT THEM AWAY THE ANCIENT TORRENT THE TORRENT KISHON

MARCH ON MY SOUL WITH MIGHT

THEN LOUD BEAT THE HORSES' HOOFS WITH THE GALLOPING GALLOPING OF HIS STEEDS

CURSE MEROZ SAYS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CURSE ITS INHABITANTS THOROUGHLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT COME TO THE HELP OF THE LORD TO THE HELP OF THE LORD AGAINST THE MIGHTY

MOST BLESSED OF WOMEN BE JAEL THE WIFE OF HEBER THE KENITE OF TENTDWELLING WOMEN MOST BLESSED

HE ASKED WATER AND SHE GAVE HIM MILK; SHE BROUGHT HIM CURDS IN A NOBLE'S BOWL

SHE SENT HER HAND TO THE TENT PEG AND HER RIGHT HAND TO THE WORKMEN'S MALLET; SHE STRUCK SISERA; SHE CRUSHED HIS HEAD; SHE SHATTERED AND PIERCED HIS TEMPLE

BETWEEN HER FEET HE SANK HE FELL HE LAY STILL; BETWEEN HER FEET HE SANK HE FELL; WHERE HE SANK THERE HE FELLDEAD

OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE PEERED THE MOTHER OF SISERA WAILED THROUGH THE LATTICE 'WHY IS HIS CHARIOT SO LONG IN COMING

WHY TARRY THE HOOFBEATS OF HIS CHARIOTS

' HER WISEST PRINCESSES ANSWER INDEED SHE ANSWERS HERSELF 'HAVE THEY NOT FOUND AND DIVIDED THE SPOIL

A WOMB OR TWO FOR EVERY MAN; SPOIL OF DYED MATERIALS FOR SISERA SPOIL OF DYED MATERIALS EMBROIDERED TWO PIECES OF DYED WORK EMBROIDERED FOR THE NECK AS SPOIL

' SO MAY ALL YOUR ENEMIES PERISH O LORD

BUT YOUR FRIENDS BE LIKE THE SUN AS HE RISES IN HIS MIGHT

AND THE LAND HAD REST FOR FORTY YEARS

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND THE LORD GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MIDIAN SEVEN YEARS

AND THE HAND OF MIDIAN OVERPOWERED ISRAEL AND BECAUSE OF MIDIAN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MADE FOR THEMSELVES THE DENS THAT ARE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CAVES AND THE STRONGHOLDS

FOR WHENEVER THE ISRAELITES PLANTED CROPS THE MIDIANITES AND THE AMALEKITES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST WOULD COME UP AGAINST THEM

THEY WOULD ENCAMP AGAINST THEM AND DEVOUR THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND AS FAR AS GAZA AND LEAVE NO SUSTENANCE IN ISRAEL AND NO SHEEP OR OX OR DONKEY

FOR THEY WOULD COME UP WITH THEIR LIVESTOCK AND THEIR TENTS; THEY WOULD COME LIKE LOCUSTS IN NUMBERBOTH THEY AND THEIR CAMELS COULD NOT BE COUNTEDSO THAT THEY LAID WASTE THE LAND AS THEY CAME IN

AND ISRAEL WAS BROUGHT VERY LOW BECAUSE OF MIDIAN

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT FOR HELP TO THE LORD

WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD ON ACCOUNT OF THE MIDIANITES THE LORD SENT A PROPHET TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND HE SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL I LED YOU UP FROM EGYPT AND BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE

AND I DELIVERED YOU FROM THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO OPPRESSED YOU AND DROVE THEM OUT BEFORE YOU AND GAVE YOU THEIR LAND

AND I SAID TO YOU 'I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD; YOU SHALL NOT FEAR THE GODS OF THE AMORITES IN WHOSE LAND YOU DWELL

' BUT YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE

 NOW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME AND SAT UNDER THE TEREBINTH AT OPHRAH WHICH BELONGED TO JOASH THE ABIEZRITE WHILE HIS SON GIDEON WAS BEATING OUT WHEAT IN THE WINEPRESS TO HIDE IT FROM THE MIDIANITES

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM THE LORD IS WITH YOU O MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR

 AND GIDEON SAID TO HIM PLEASE SIR IF THE LORD IS WITH US WHY THEN HAS ALL THIS HAPPENED TO US

AND WHERE ARE ALL HIS WONDERFUL DEEDS THAT OUR FATHERS RECOUNTED TO US SAYING 'DID NOT THE LORD BRING US UP FROM EGYPT

' BUT NOW THE LORD HAS FORSAKEN US AND GIVEN US INTO THE HAND OF MIDIAN

 AND THE LORD TURNED TO HIM AND SAID GO IN THIS MIGHT OF YOURS AND SAVE ISRAEL FROM THE HAND OF MIDIAN; DO NOT I SEND YOU

 AND HE SAID TO HIM PLEASE LORD HOW CAN I SAVE ISRAEL

BEHOLD MY CLAN IS THE WEAKEST IN MANASSEH AND I AM THE LEAST IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE

 AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM BUT I WILL BE WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL STRIKE THE MIDIANITES AS ONE MAN

 AND HE SAID TO HIM IF NOW I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES THEN SHOW ME A SIGN THAT IT IS YOU WHO SPEAKS WITH ME

PLEASE DO NOT DEPART FROM HERE UNTIL I COME TO YOU AND BRING OUT MY PRESENT AND SET IT BEFORE YOU

 AND HE SAID I WILL STAY TILL YOU RETURN

 SO GIDEON WENT INTO HIS HOUSE AND PREPARED A YOUNG GOAT AND UNLEAVENED CAKES FROM AN EPHAH OF FLOUR

THE MEAT HE PUT IN A BASKET AND THE BROTH HE PUT IN A POT AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIM UNDER THE TEREBINTH AND PRESENTED THEM

AND THE ANGEL OF GOD SAID TO HIM TAKE THE MEAT AND THE UNLEAVENED CAKES AND PUT THEM ON THIS ROCK AND POUR THE BROTH OVER THEM

 AND HE DID SO

THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD REACHED OUT THE TIP OF THE STAFF THAT WAS IN HIS HAND AND TOUCHED THE MEAT AND THE UNLEAVENED CAKES

AND FIRE SPRANG UP FROM THE ROCK AND CONSUMED THE FLESH AND THE UNLEAVENED CAKES

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT

THEN GIDEON PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD

AND GIDEON SAID ALAS O LORD GOD

FOR NOW I HAVE SEEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD FACE TO FACE

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM PEACE BE TO YOU

DO NOT FEAR; YOU SHALL NOT DIE

 THEN GIDEON BUILT AN ALTAR THERE TO THE LORD AND CALLED IT THE LORD IS PEACE

TO THIS DAY IT STILL STANDS AT OPHRAH WHICH BELONGS TO THE ABIEZRITES

THAT NIGHT THE LORD SAID TO HIM TAKE YOUR FATHER'S BULL AND THE SECOND BULL SEVEN YEARS OLD AND PULL DOWN THE ALTAR OF BAAL THAT YOUR FATHER HAS AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERAH THAT IS BESIDE IT AND BUILD AN ALTAR TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ON THE TOP OF THE STRONGHOLD HERE WITH STONES LAID IN DUE ORDER

THEN TAKE THE SECOND BULL AND OFFER IT AS A BURNT OFFERING WITH THE WOOD OF THE ASHERAH THAT YOU SHALL CUT DOWN

 SO GIDEON TOOK TEN MEN OF HIS SERVANTS AND DID AS THE LORD HAD TOLD HIM

BUT BECAUSE HE WAS TOO AFRAID OF HIS FAMILY AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN TO DO IT BY DAY HE DID IT BY NIGHT

WHEN THE MEN OF THE TOWN ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING BEHOLD THE ALTAR OF BAAL WAS BROKEN DOWN AND THE ASHERAH BESIDE IT WAS CUT DOWN AND THE SECOND BULL WAS OFFERED ON THE ALTAR THAT HAD BEEN BUILT

AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHO HAS DONE THIS THING

 AND AFTER THEY HAD SEARCHED AND INQUIRED THEY SAID GIDEON THE SON OF JOASH HAS DONE THIS THING

 THEN THE MEN OF THE TOWN SAID TO JOASH BRING OUT YOUR SON THAT HE MAY DIE FOR HE HAS BROKEN DOWN THE ALTAR OF BAAL AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERAH BESIDE IT

 BUT JOASH SAID TO ALL WHO STOOD AGAINST HIM WILL YOU CONTEND FOR BAAL

OR WILL YOU SAVE HIM

WHOEVER CONTENDS FOR HIM SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH BY MORNING

IF HE IS A GOD LET HIM CONTEND FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HIS ALTAR HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN

 THEREFORE ON THAT DAY GIDEON WAS CALLED JERUBBAAL THAT IS TO SAY LET BAAL CONTEND AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE DOWN HIS ALTAR

NOW ALL THE MIDIANITES AND THE AMALEKITES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST CAME TOGETHER AND THEY CROSSED THE JORDAN AND ENCAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF JEZREEL

BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD CLOTHED GIDEON AND HE SOUNDED THE TRUMPET AND THE ABIEZRITES WERE CALLED OUT TO FOLLOW HIM

AND HE SENT MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT ALL MANASSEH AND THEY TOO WERE CALLED OUT TO FOLLOW HIM

AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO ASHER ZEBULUN AND NAPHTALI AND THEY WENT UP TO MEET THEM

THEN GIDEON SAID TO GOD IF YOU WILL SAVE ISRAEL BY MY HAND AS YOU HAVE SAID BEHOLD I AM LAYING A FLEECE OF WOOL ON THE THRESHING FLOOR

IF THERE IS DEW ON THE FLEECE ALONE AND IT IS DRY ON ALL THE GROUND THEN I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU WILL SAVE ISRAEL BY MY HAND AS YOU HAVE SAID

 AND IT WAS SO

WHEN HE ROSE EARLY NEXT MORNING AND SQUEEZED THE FLEECE HE WRUNG ENOUGH DEW FROM THE FLEECE TO FILL A BOWL WITH WATER

THEN GIDEON SAID TO GOD LET NOT YOUR ANGER BURN AGAINST ME; LET ME SPEAK JUST ONCE MORE

PLEASE LET ME TEST JUST ONCE MORE WITH THE FLEECE

PLEASE LET IT BE DRY ON THE FLEECE ONLY AND ON ALL THE GROUND LET THERE BE DEW

 AND GOD DID SO THAT NIGHT; AND IT WAS DRY ON THE FLEECE ONLY AND ON ALL THE GROUND THERE WAS DEW

THEN JERUBBAAL THAT IS GIDEON AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM ROSE EARLY AND ENCAMPED BESIDE THE SPRING OF HAROD

AND THE CAMP OF MIDIAN WAS NORTH OF THEM BY THE HILL OF MOREH IN THE VALLEY

THE LORD SAID TO GIDEON THE PEOPLE WITH YOU ARE TOO MANY FOR ME TO GIVE THE MIDIANITES INTO THEIR HAND LEST ISRAEL BOAST OVER ME SAYING 'MY OWN HAND HAS SAVED ME

' NOW THEREFORE PROCLAIM IN THE EARS OF THE PEOPLE SAYING 'WHOEVER IS FEARFUL AND TREMBLING LET HIM RETURN HOME AND HURRY AWAY FROM MOUNT GILEAD

' THEN  OF THE PEOPLE RETURNED AND  REMAINED

AND THE LORD SAID TO GIDEON THE PEOPLE ARE STILL TOO MANY

TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE WATER AND I WILL TEST THEM FOR YOU THERE AND ANYONE OF WHOM I SAY TO YOU 'THIS ONE SHALL GO WITH YOU' SHALL GO WITH YOU AND ANYONE OF WHOM I SAY TO YOU 'THIS ONE SHALL NOT GO WITH YOU' SHALL NOT GO

 SO HE BROUGHT THE PEOPLE DOWN TO THE WATER

AND THE LORD SAID TO GIDEON EVERY ONE WHO LAPS THE WATER WITH HIS TONGUE AS A DOG LAPS YOU SHALL SET BY HIMSELF

LIKEWISE EVERY ONE WHO KNEELS DOWN TO DRINK

 AND THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO LAPPED PUTTING THEIR HANDS TO THEIR MOUTHS WAS  MEN BUT ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE KNELT DOWN TO DRINK WATER

AND THE LORD SAID TO GIDEON WITH THE  MEN WHO LAPPED I WILL SAVE YOU AND GIVE THE MIDIANITES INTO YOUR HAND AND LET ALL THE OTHERS GO EVERY MAN TO HIS HOME

 SO THE PEOPLE TOOK PROVISIONS IN THEIR HANDS AND THEIR TRUMPETS

AND HE SENT ALL THE REST OF ISRAEL EVERY MAN TO HIS TENT BUT RETAINED THE  MEN

AND THE CAMP OF MIDIAN WAS BELOW HIM IN THE VALLEY

THAT SAME NIGHT THE LORD SAID TO HIM ARISE GO DOWN AGAINST THE CAMP FOR I HAVE GIVEN IT INTO YOUR HAND

BUT IF YOU ARE AFRAID TO GO DOWN GO DOWN TO THE CAMP WITH PURAH YOUR SERVANT

AND YOU SHALL HEAR WHAT THEY SAY AND AFTERWARD YOUR HANDS SHALL BE STRENGTHENED TO GO DOWN AGAINST THE CAMP

 THEN HE WENT DOWN WITH PURAH HIS SERVANT TO THE OUTPOSTS OF THE ARMED MEN WHO WERE IN THE CAMP

AND THE MIDIANITES AND THE AMALEKITES AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST LAY ALONG THE VALLEY LIKE LOCUSTS IN ABUNDANCE AND THEIR CAMELS WERE WITHOUT NUMBER AS THE SAND THAT IS ON THE SEASHORE IN ABUNDANCE

WHEN GIDEON CAME BEHOLD A MAN WAS TELLING A DREAM TO HIS COMRADE

AND HE SAID BEHOLD I DREAMED A DREAM AND BEHOLD A CAKE OF BARLEY BREAD TUMBLED INTO THE CAMP OF MIDIAN AND CAME TO THE TENT AND STRUCK IT SO THAT IT FELL AND TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT THE TENT LAY FLAT

 AND HIS COMRADE ANSWERED THIS IS NO OTHER THAN THE SWORD OF GIDEON THE SON OF JOASH A MAN OF ISRAEL; GOD HAS GIVEN INTO HIS HAND MIDIAN AND ALL THE CAMP

 AS SOON AS GIDEON HEARD THE TELLING OF THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION HE WORSHIPED

AND HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP OF ISRAEL AND SAID ARISE FOR THE LORD HAS GIVEN THE HOST OF MIDIAN INTO YOUR HAND

 AND HE DIVIDED THE  MEN INTO THREE COMPANIES AND PUT TRUMPETS INTO THE HANDS OF ALL OF THEM AND EMPTY JARS WITH TORCHES INSIDE THE JARS

AND HE SAID TO THEM LOOK AT ME AND DO LIKEWISE

WHEN I COME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAMP DO AS I DO

WHEN I BLOW THE TRUMPET I AND ALL WHO ARE WITH ME THEN BLOW THE TRUMPETS ALSO ON EVERY SIDE OF ALL THE CAMP AND SHOUT 'FOR THE LORD AND FOR GIDEON

' SO GIDEON AND THE HUNDRED MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAMP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MIDDLE WATCH WHEN THEY HAD JUST SET THE WATCH

AND THEY BLEW THE TRUMPETS AND SMASHED THE JARS THAT WERE IN THEIR HANDS

THEN THE THREE COMPANIES BLEW THE TRUMPETS AND BROKE THE JARS

THEY HELD IN THEIR LEFT HANDS THE TORCHES AND IN THEIR RIGHT HANDS THE TRUMPETS TO BLOW

AND THEY CRIED OUT A SWORD FOR THE LORD AND FOR GIDEON

 EVERY MAN STOOD IN HIS PLACE AROUND THE CAMP AND ALL THE ARMY RAN

THEY CRIED OUT AND FLED

WHEN THEY BLEW THE  TRUMPETS THE LORD SET EVERY MAN'S SWORD AGAINST HIS COMRADE AND AGAINST ALL THE ARMY

AND THE ARMY FLED AS FAR AS BETHSHITTAH TOWARD ZERERAH AS FAR AS THE BORDER OF ABELMEHOLAH BY TABBATH

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE CALLED OUT FROM NAPHTALI AND FROM ASHER AND FROM ALL MANASSEH AND THEY PURSUED AFTER MIDIAN

GIDEON SENT MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT ALL THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM SAYING COME DOWN AGAINST THE MIDIANITES AND CAPTURE THE WATERS AGAINST THEM AS FAR AS BETHBARAH AND ALSO THE JORDAN

 SO ALL THE MEN OF EPHRAIM WERE CALLED OUT AND THEY CAPTURED THE WATERS AS FAR AS BETHBARAH AND ALSO THE JORDAN

AND THEY CAPTURED THE TWO PRINCES OF MIDIAN OREB AND ZEEB

THEY KILLED OREB AT THE ROCK OF OREB AND ZEEB THEY KILLED AT THE WINEPRESS OF ZEEB

THEN THEY PURSUED MIDIAN AND THEY BROUGHT THE HEADS OF OREB AND ZEEB TO GIDEON ACROSS THE JORDAN

THEN THE MEN OF EPHRAIM SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE TO US NOT TO CALL US WHEN YOU WENT TO FIGHT WITH MIDIAN

 AND THEY ACCUSED HIM FIERCELY

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW IN COMPARISON WITH YOU

IS NOT THE GLEANING OF THE GRAPES OF EPHRAIM BETTER THAN THE GRAPE HARVEST OF ABIEZER

GOD HAS GIVEN INTO YOUR HANDS THE PRINCES OF MIDIAN OREB AND ZEEB

WHAT HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO DO IN COMPARISON WITH YOU

 THEN THEIR ANGER AGAINST HIM SUBSIDED WHEN HE SAID THIS

AND GIDEON CAME TO THE JORDAN AND CROSSED OVER HE AND THE  MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM EXHAUSTED YET PURSUING

SO HE SAID TO THE MEN OF SUCCOTH PLEASE GIVE LOAVES OF BREAD TO THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW ME FOR THEY ARE EXHAUSTED AND I AM PURSUING AFTER ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA THE KINGS OF MIDIAN

 AND THE OFFICIALS OF SUCCOTH SAID ARE THE HANDS OF ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA ALREADY IN YOUR HAND THAT WE SHOULD GIVE BREAD TO YOUR ARMY

 SO GIDEON SAID WELL THEN WHEN THE LORD HAS GIVEN ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA INTO MY HAND I WILL FLAIL YOUR FLESH WITH THE THORNS OF THE WILDERNESS AND WITH BRIERS

 AND FROM THERE HE WENT UP TO PENUEL AND SPOKE TO THEM IN THE SAME WAY AND THE MEN OF PENUEL ANSWERED HIM AS THE MEN OF SUCCOTH HAD ANSWERED

AND HE SAID TO THE MEN OF PENUEL WHEN I COME AGAIN IN PEACE I WILL BREAK DOWN THIS TOWER

 NOW ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA WERE IN KARKOR WITH THEIR ARMY ABOUT  MEN ALL WHO WERE LEFT OF ALL THE ARMY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST FOR THERE HAD FALLEN  MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD

AND GIDEON WENT UP BY THE WAY OF THE TENT DWELLERS EAST OF NOBAH AND JOGBEHAH AND ATTACKED THE ARMY FOR THE ARMY FELT SECURE

AND ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA FLED AND HE PURSUED THEM AND CAPTURED THE TWO KINGS OF MIDIAN ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA AND HE THREW ALL THE ARMY INTO A PANIC

THEN GIDEON THE SON OF JOASH RETURNED FROM THE BATTLE BY THE ASCENT OF HERES

AND HE CAPTURED A YOUNG MAN OF SUCCOTH AND QUESTIONED HIM

AND HE WROTE DOWN FOR HIM THE OFFICIALS AND ELDERS OF SUCCOTH SEVENTYSEVEN MEN

AND HE CAME TO THE MEN OF SUCCOTH AND SAID BEHOLD ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA ABOUT WHOM YOU TAUNTED ME SAYING 'ARE THE HANDS OF ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA ALREADY IN YOUR HAND THAT WE SHOULD GIVE BREAD TO YOUR MEN WHO ARE EXHAUSTED

' AND HE TOOK THE ELDERS OF THE CITY AND HE TOOK THORNS OF THE WILDERNESS AND BRIERS AND WITH THEM TAUGHT THE MEN OF SUCCOTH A LESSON

AND HE BROKE DOWN THE TOWER OF PENUEL AND KILLED THE MEN OF THE CITY

THEN HE SAID TO ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA WHERE ARE THE MEN WHOM YOU KILLED AT TABOR

 THEY ANSWERED AS YOU ARE SO WERE THEY

EVERY ONE OF THEM RESEMBLED THE SON OF A KING

 AND HE SAID THEY WERE MY BROTHERS THE SONS OF MY MOTHER

AS THE LORD LIVES IF YOU HAD SAVED THEM ALIVE I WOULD NOT KILL YOU

 SO HE SAID TO JETHER HIS FIRSTBORN RISE AND KILL THEM

 BUT THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT DRAW HIS SWORD FOR HE WAS AFRAID BECAUSE HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN

THEN ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA SAID RISE YOURSELF AND FALL UPON US FOR AS THE MAN IS SO IS HIS STRENGTH

 AND GIDEON AROSE AND KILLED ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA AND HE TOOK THE CRESCENT ORNAMENTS THAT WERE ON THE NECKS OF THEIR CAMELS

THEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAID TO GIDEON RULE OVER US YOU AND YOUR SON AND YOUR GRANDSON ALSO FOR YOU HAVE SAVED US FROM THE HAND OF MIDIAN

 GIDEON SAID TO THEM I WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU AND MY SON WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU; THE LORD WILL RULE OVER YOU

 AND GIDEON SAID TO THEM LET ME MAKE A REQUEST OF YOU EVERY ONE OF YOU GIVE ME THE EARRINGS FROM HIS SPOIL

 FOR THEY HAD GOLDEN EARRINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE ISHMAELITES

 AND THEY ANSWERED WE WILL WILLINGLY GIVE THEM

 AND THEY SPREAD A CLOAK AND EVERY MAN THREW IN IT THE EARRINGS OF HIS SPOIL

AND THE WEIGHT OF THE GOLDEN EARRINGS THAT HE REQUESTED WAS  SHEKELS OF GOLD BESIDES THE CRESCENT ORNAMENTS AND THE PENDANTS AND THE PURPLE GARMENTS WORN BY THE KINGS OF MIDIAN AND BESIDES THE COLLARS THAT WERE AROUND THE NECKS OF THEIR CAMELS

AND GIDEON MADE AN EPHOD OF IT AND PUT IT IN HIS CITY IN OPHRAH

AND ALL ISRAEL WHORED AFTER IT THERE AND IT BECAME A SNARE TO GIDEON AND TO HIS FAMILY

SO MIDIAN WAS SUBDUED BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THEY RAISED THEIR HEADS NO MORE

AND THE LAND HAD REST FORTY YEARS IN THE DAYS OF GIDEON

JERUBBAAL THE SON OF JOASH WENT AND LIVED IN HIS OWN HOUSE

NOW GIDEON HAD SEVENTY SONS HIS OWN OFFSPRING FOR HE HAD MANY WIVES

AND HIS CONCUBINE WHO WAS IN SHECHEM ALSO BORE HIM A SON AND HE CALLED HIS NAME ABIMELECH

AND GIDEON THE SON OF JOASH DIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE AND WAS BURIED IN THE TOMB OF JOASH HIS FATHER AT OPHRAH OF THE ABIEZRITES

AS SOON AS GIDEON DIED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TURNED AGAIN AND WHORED AFTER THE BAALS AND MADE BAALBERITH THEIR GOD

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID NOT REMEMBER THE LORD THEIR GOD WHO HAD DELIVERED THEM FROM THE HAND OF ALL THEIR ENEMIES ON EVERY SIDE AND THEY DID NOT SHOW STEADFAST LOVE TO THE FAMILY OF JERUBBAAL THAT IS GIDEON IN RETURN FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAD DONE TO ISRAEL

NOW ABIMELECH THE SON OF JERUBBAAL WENT TO SHECHEM TO HIS MOTHER'S RELATIVES AND SAID TO THEM AND TO THE WHOLE CLAN OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY SAY IN THE EARS OF ALL THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM 'WHICH IS BETTER FOR YOU THAT ALL SEVENTY OF THE SONS OF JERUBBAAL RULE OVER YOU OR THAT ONE RULE OVER YOU

' REMEMBER ALSO THAT I AM YOUR BONE AND YOUR FLESH

 AND HIS MOTHER'S RELATIVES SPOKE ALL THESE WORDS ON HIS BEHALF IN THE EARS OF ALL THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM AND THEIR HEARTS INCLINED TO FOLLOW ABIMELECH FOR THEY SAID HE IS OUR BROTHER

 AND THEY GAVE HIM SEVENTY PIECES OF SILVER OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BAALBERITH WITH WHICH ABIMELECH HIRED WORTHLESS AND RECKLESS FELLOWS WHO FOLLOWED HIM

AND HE WENT TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AT OPHRAH AND KILLED HIS BROTHERS THE SONS OF JERUBBAAL SEVENTY MEN ON ONE STONE

BUT JOTHAM THE YOUNGEST SON OF JERUBBAAL WAS LEFT FOR HE HID HIMSELF

AND ALL THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM CAME TOGETHER AND ALL BETHMILLO AND THEY WENT AND MADE ABIMELECH KING BY THE OAK OF THE PILLAR AT SHECHEM

WHEN IT WAS TOLD TO JOTHAM HE WENT AND STOOD ON TOP OF MOUNT GERIZIM AND CRIED ALOUD AND SAID TO THEM LISTEN TO ME YOU LEADERS OF SHECHEM THAT GOD MAY LISTEN TO YOU

THE TREES ONCE WENT OUT TO ANOINT A KING OVER THEM AND THEY SAID TO THE OLIVE TREE 'REIGN OVER US

' BUT THE OLIVE TREE SAID TO THEM 'SHALL I LEAVE MY ABUNDANCE BY WHICH GODS AND MEN ARE HONORED AND GO HOLD SWAY OVER THE TREES

' AND THE TREES SAID TO THE FIG TREE 'YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US

' BUT THE FIG TREE SAID TO THEM 'SHALL I LEAVE MY SWEETNESS AND MY GOOD FRUIT AND GO HOLD SWAY OVER THE TREES

' AND THE TREES SAID TO THE VINE 'YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US

' BUT THE VINE SAID TO THEM 'SHALL I LEAVE MY WINE THAT CHEERS GOD AND MEN AND GO HOLD SWAY OVER THE TREES

' THEN ALL THE TREES SAID TO THE BRAMBLE 'YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US

' AND THE BRAMBLE SAID TO THE TREES 'IF IN GOOD FAITH YOU ARE ANOINTING ME KING OVER YOU THEN COME AND TAKE REFUGE IN MY SHADE BUT IF NOT LET FIRE COME OUT OF THE BRAMBLE AND DEVOUR THE CEDARS OF LEBANON

' NOW THEREFORE IF YOU ACTED IN GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY WHEN YOU MADE ABIMELECH KING AND IF YOU HAVE DEALT WELL WITH JERUBBAAL AND HIS HOUSE AND HAVE DONE TO HIM AS HIS DEEDS DESERVED FOR MY FATHER FOUGHT FOR YOU AND RISKED HIS LIFE AND DELIVERED YOU FROM THE HAND OF MIDIAN AND YOU HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST MY FATHER'S HOUSE THIS DAY AND HAVE KILLED HIS SONS SEVENTY MEN ON ONE STONE AND HAVE MADE ABIMELECH THE SON OF HIS FEMALE SERVANT KING OVER THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM BECAUSE HE IS YOUR RELATIVE IF YOU THEN HAVE ACTED IN GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY WITH JERUBBAAL AND WITH HIS HOUSE THIS DAY THEN REJOICE IN ABIMELECH AND LET HIM ALSO REJOICE IN YOU

BUT IF NOT LET FIRE COME OUT FROM ABIMELECH AND DEVOUR THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM AND BETHMILLO; AND LET FIRE COME OUT FROM THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM AND FROM BETHMILLO AND DEVOUR ABIMELECH

 AND JOTHAM RAN AWAY AND FLED AND WENT TO BEER AND LIVED THERE BECAUSE OF ABIMELECH HIS BROTHER

ABIMELECH RULED OVER ISRAEL THREE YEARS

AND GOD SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT BETWEEN ABIMELECH AND THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM AND THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM DEALT TREACHEROUSLY WITH ABIMELECH THAT THE VIOLENCE DONE TO THE SEVENTY SONS OF JERUBBAAL MIGHT COME AND THEIR BLOOD BE LAID ON ABIMELECH THEIR BROTHER WHO KILLED THEM AND ON THE MEN OF SHECHEM WHO STRENGTHENED HIS HANDS TO KILL HIS BROTHERS

AND THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM PUT MEN IN AMBUSH AGAINST HIM ON THE MOUNTAINTOPS AND THEY ROBBED ALL WHO PASSED BY THEM ALONG THAT WAY

AND IT WAS TOLD TO ABIMELECH

AND GAAL THE SON OF EBED MOVED INTO SHECHEM WITH HIS RELATIVES AND THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM PUT CONFIDENCE IN HIM

AND THEY WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD AND GATHERED THE GRAPES FROM THEIR VINEYARDS AND TROD THEM AND HELD A FESTIVAL; AND THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THEIR GOD AND ATE AND DRANK AND REVILED ABIMELECH

AND GAAL THE SON OF EBED SAID WHO IS ABIMELECH AND WHO ARE WE OF SHECHEM THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM

IS HE NOT THE SON OF JERUBBAAL AND IS NOT ZEBUL HIS OFFICER

SERVE THE MEN OF HAMOR THE FATHER OF SHECHEM; BUT WHY SHOULD WE SERVE HIM

WOULD THAT THIS PEOPLE WERE UNDER MY HAND

THEN I WOULD REMOVE ABIMELECH

I WOULD SAY TO ABIMELECH 'INCREASE YOUR ARMY AND COME OUT

' WHEN ZEBUL THE RULER OF THE CITY HEARD THE WORDS OF GAAL THE SON OF EBED HIS ANGER WAS KINDLED

AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO ABIMELECH SECRETLY SAYING BEHOLD GAAL THE SON OF EBED AND HIS RELATIVES HAVE COME TO SHECHEM AND THEY ARE STIRRING UP THE CITY AGAINST YOU

NOW THEREFORE GO BY NIGHT YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH YOU AND SET AN AMBUSH IN THE FIELD

THEN IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS THE SUN IS UP RISE EARLY AND RUSH UPON THE CITY

AND WHEN HE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH HIM COME OUT AGAINST YOU YOU MAY DO TO THEM AS YOUR HAND FINDS TO DO

 SO ABIMELECH AND ALL THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM ROSE UP BY NIGHT AND SET AN AMBUSH AGAINST SHECHEM IN FOUR COMPANIES

AND GAAL THE SON OF EBED WENT OUT AND STOOD IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF THE CITY AND ABIMELECH AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM ROSE FROM THE AMBUSH

AND WHEN GAAL SAW THE PEOPLE HE SAID TO ZEBUL LOOK PEOPLE ARE COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINTOPS

 AND ZEBUL SAID TO HIM YOU MISTAKE THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR MEN

 GAAL SPOKE AGAIN AND SAID LOOK PEOPLE ARE COMING DOWN FROM THE CENTER OF THE LAND AND ONE COMPANY IS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE DIVINERS' OAK

 THEN ZEBUL SAID TO HIM WHERE IS YOUR MOUTH NOW YOU WHO SAID 'WHO IS ABIMELECH THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM

' ARE NOT THESE THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU DESPISED

GO OUT NOW AND FIGHT WITH THEM

 AND GAAL WENT OUT AT THE HEAD OF THE LEADERS OF SHECHEM AND FOUGHT WITH ABIMELECH

AND ABIMELECH CHASED HIM AND HE FLED BEFORE HIM

AND MANY FELL WOUNDED UP TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE

AND ABIMELECH LIVED AT ARUMAH AND ZEBUL DROVE OUT GAAL AND HIS RELATIVES SO THAT THEY COULD NOT DWELL AT SHECHEM

ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE PEOPLE WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD AND ABIMELECH WAS TOLD

HE TOOK HIS PEOPLE AND DIVIDED THEM INTO THREE COMPANIES AND SET AN AMBUSH IN THE FIELDS

AND HE LOOKED AND SAW THE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE CITY

SO HE ROSE AGAINST THEM AND KILLED THEM

ABIMELECH AND THE COMPANY THAT WAS WITH HIM RUSHED FORWARD AND STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF THE CITY WHILE THE TWO COMPANIES RUSHED UPON ALL WHO WERE IN THE FIELD AND KILLED THEM

AND ABIMELECH FOUGHT AGAINST THE CITY ALL THAT DAY

HE CAPTURED THE CITY AND KILLED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT AND HE RAZED THE CITY AND SOWED IT WITH SALT

WHEN ALL THE LEADERS OF THE TOWER OF SHECHEM HEARD OF IT THEY ENTERED THE STRONGHOLD OF THE HOUSE OF ELBERITH

ABIMELECH WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE LEADERS OF THE TOWER OF SHECHEM WERE GATHERED TOGETHER

AND ABIMELECH WENT UP TO MOUNT ZALMON HE AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND ABIMELECH TOOK AN AXE IN HIS HAND AND CUT DOWN A BUNDLE OF BRUSHWOOD AND TOOK IT UP AND LAID IT ON HIS SHOULDER

AND HE SAID TO THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN ME DO HURRY AND DO AS I HAVE DONE

 SO EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE CUT DOWN HIS BUNDLE AND FOLLOWING ABIMELECH PUT IT AGAINST THE STRONGHOLD AND THEY SET THE STRONGHOLD ON FIRE OVER THEM SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWER OF SHECHEM ALSO DIED ABOUT  MEN AND WOMEN

THEN ABIMELECH WENT TO THEBEZ AND ENCAMPED AGAINST THEBEZ AND CAPTURED IT

BUT THERE WAS A STRONG TOWER WITHIN THE CITY AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE CITY FLED TO IT AND SHUT THEMSELVES IN AND THEY WENT UP TO THE ROOF OF THE TOWER

AND ABIMELECH CAME TO THE TOWER AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT AND DREW NEAR TO THE DOOR OF THE TOWER TO BURN IT WITH FIRE

AND A CERTAIN WOMAN THREW AN UPPER MILLSTONE ON ABIMELECH'S HEAD AND CRUSHED HIS SKULL

THEN HE CALLED QUICKLY TO THE YOUNG MAN HIS ARMORBEARER AND SAID TO HIM DRAW YOUR SWORD AND KILL ME LEST THEY SAY OF ME 'A WOMAN KILLED HIM

' AND HIS YOUNG MAN THRUST HIM THROUGH AND HE DIED

AND WHEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAW THAT ABIMELECH WAS DEAD EVERYONE DEPARTED TO HIS HOME

THUS GOD RETURNED THE EVIL OF ABIMELECH WHICH HE COMMITTED AGAINST HIS FATHER IN KILLING HIS SEVENTY BROTHERS

AND GOD ALSO MADE ALL THE EVIL OF THE MEN OF SHECHEM RETURN ON THEIR HEADS AND UPON THEM CAME THE CURSE OF JOTHAM THE SON OF JERUBBAAL

AFTER ABIMELECH THERE AROSE TO SAVE ISRAEL TOLA THE SON OF PUAH SON OF DODO A MAN OF ISSACHAR AND HE LIVED AT SHAMIR IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM

AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL TWENTYTHREE YEARS

THEN HE DIED AND WAS BURIED AT SHAMIR

AFTER HIM AROSE JAIR THE GILEADITE WHO JUDGED ISRAEL TWENTYTWO YEARS

AND HE HAD THIRTY SONS WHO RODE ON THIRTY DONKEYS AND THEY HAD THIRTY CITIES CALLED HAVVOTHJAIR TO THIS DAY WHICH ARE IN THE LAND OF GILEAD

AND JAIR DIED AND WAS BURIED IN KAMON

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AGAIN DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASHTAROTH THE GODS OF SYRIA THE GODS OF SIDON THE GODS OF MOAB THE GODS OF THE AMMONITES AND THE GODS OF THE PHILISTINES

AND THEY FORSOOK THE LORD AND DID NOT SERVE HIM

SO THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE SOLD THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND INTO THE HAND OF THE AMMONITES AND THEY CRUSHED AND OPPRESSED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT YEAR

FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS THEY OPPRESSED ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN IN THE LAND OF THE AMORITES WHICH IS IN GILEAD

AND THE AMMONITES CROSSED THE JORDAN TO FIGHT ALSO AGAINST JUDAH AND AGAINST BENJAMIN AND AGAINST THE HOUSE OF EPHRAIM SO THAT ISRAEL WAS SEVERELY DISTRESSED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD SAYING WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE FORSAKEN OUR GOD AND HAVE SERVED THE BAALS

 AND THE LORD SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID I NOT SAVE YOU FROM THE EGYPTIANS AND FROM THE AMORITES FROM THE AMMONITES AND FROM THE PHILISTINES

THE SIDONIANS ALSO AND THE AMALEKITES AND THE MAONITES OPPRESSED YOU AND YOU CRIED OUT TO ME AND I SAVED YOU OUT OF THEIR HAND

YET YOU HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND SERVED OTHER GODS; THEREFORE I WILL SAVE YOU NO MORE

GO AND CRY OUT TO THE GODS WHOM YOU HAVE CHOSEN; LET THEM SAVE YOU IN THE TIME OF YOUR DISTRESS

 AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TO THE LORD WE HAVE SINNED; DO TO US WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

ONLY PLEASE DELIVER US THIS DAY

 SO THEY PUT AWAY THE FOREIGN GODS FROM AMONG THEM AND SERVED THE LORD AND HE BECAME IMPATIENT OVER THE MISERY OF ISRAEL

THEN THE AMMONITES WERE CALLED TO ARMS AND THEY ENCAMPED IN GILEAD

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME TOGETHER AND THEY ENCAMPED AT MIZPAH

AND THE PEOPLE THE LEADERS OF GILEAD SAID ONE TO ANOTHER WHO IS THE MAN WHO WILL BEGIN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE AMMONITES

HE SHALL BE HEAD OVER ALL THE INHABITANTS OF GILEAD

NOW JEPHTHAH THE GILEADITE WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR BUT HE WAS THE SON OF A PROSTITUTE

GILEAD WAS THE FATHER OF JEPHTHAH

AND GILEAD'S WIFE ALSO BORE HIM SONS

AND WHEN HIS WIFE'S SONS GREW UP THEY DROVE JEPHTHAH OUT AND SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL NOT HAVE AN INHERITANCE IN OUR FATHER'S HOUSE FOR YOU ARE THE SON OF ANOTHER WOMAN

 THEN JEPHTHAH FLED FROM HIS BROTHERS AND LIVED IN THE LAND OF TOB AND WORTHLESS FELLOWS COLLECTED AROUND JEPHTHAH AND WENT OUT WITH HIM

AFTER A TIME THE AMMONITES MADE WAR AGAINST ISRAEL

AND WHEN THE AMMONITES MADE WAR AGAINST ISRAEL THE ELDERS OF GILEAD WENT TO BRING JEPHTHAH FROM THE LAND OF TOB

AND THEY SAID TO JEPHTHAH COME AND BE OUR LEADER THAT WE MAY FIGHT WITH THE AMMONITES

 BUT JEPHTHAH SAID TO THE ELDERS OF GILEAD DID YOU NOT HATE ME AND DRIVE ME OUT OF MY FATHER'S HOUSE

WHY HAVE YOU COME TO ME NOW WHEN YOU ARE IN DISTRESS

 AND THE ELDERS OF GILEAD SAID TO JEPHTHAH THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TURNED TO YOU NOW THAT YOU MAY GO WITH US AND FIGHT WITH THE AMMONITES AND BE OUR HEAD OVER ALL THE INHABITANTS OF GILEAD

 JEPHTHAH SAID TO THE ELDERS OF GILEAD IF YOU BRING ME HOME AGAIN TO FIGHT WITH THE AMMONITES AND THE LORD GIVES THEM OVER TO ME I WILL BE YOUR HEAD

 AND THE ELDERS OF GILEAD SAID TO JEPHTHAH THE LORD WILL BE WITNESS BETWEEN US IF WE DO NOT DO AS YOU SAY

 SO JEPHTHAH WENT WITH THE ELDERS OF GILEAD AND THE PEOPLE MADE HIM HEAD AND LEADER OVER THEM

AND JEPHTHAH SPOKE ALL HIS WORDS BEFORE THE LORD AT MIZPAH

THEN JEPHTHAH SENT MESSENGERS TO THE KING OF THE AMMONITES AND SAID WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ME THAT YOU HAVE COME TO ME TO FIGHT AGAINST MY LAND

 AND THE KING OF THE AMMONITES ANSWERED THE MESSENGERS OF JEPHTHAH BECAUSE ISRAEL ON COMING UP FROM EGYPT TOOK AWAY MY LAND FROM THE ARNON TO THE JABBOK AND TO THE JORDAN; NOW THEREFORE RESTORE IT PEACEABLY

 JEPHTHAH AGAIN SENT MESSENGERS TO THE KING OF THE AMMONITES AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS JEPHTHAH ISRAEL DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE LAND OF MOAB OR THE LAND OF THE AMMONITES BUT WHEN THEY CAME UP FROM EGYPT ISRAEL WENT THROUGH THE WILDERNESS TO THE RED SEA AND CAME TO KADESH

ISRAEL THEN SENT MESSENGERS TO THE KING OF EDOM SAYING 'PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND' BUT THE KING OF EDOM WOULD NOT LISTEN

AND THEY SENT ALSO TO THE KING OF MOAB BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT

SO ISRAEL REMAINED AT KADESH

THEN THEY JOURNEYED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS AND WENT AROUND THE LAND OF EDOM AND THE LAND OF MOAB AND ARRIVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE LAND OF MOAB AND CAMPED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARNON

BUT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE TERRITORY OF MOAB FOR THE ARNON WAS THE BOUNDARY OF MOAB

ISRAEL THEN SENT MESSENGERS TO SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES KING OF HESHBON AND ISRAEL SAID TO HIM 'PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND TO OUR COUNTRY' BUT SIHON DID NOT TRUST ISRAEL TO PASS THROUGH HIS TERRITORY SO SIHON GATHERED ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND ENCAMPED AT JAHAZ AND FOUGHT WITH ISRAEL

AND THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL GAVE SIHON AND ALL HIS PEOPLE INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL AND THEY DEFEATED THEM

SO ISRAEL TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL THE LAND OF THE AMORITES WHO INHABITED THAT COUNTRY

AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL THE TERRITORY OF THE AMORITES FROM THE ARNON TO THE JABBOK AND FROM THE WILDERNESS TO THE JORDAN

SO THEN THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL DISPOSSESSED THE AMORITES FROM BEFORE HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL; AND ARE YOU TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM

WILL YOU NOT POSSESS WHAT CHEMOSH YOUR GOD GIVES YOU TO POSSESS

AND ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD HAS DISPOSSESSED BEFORE US WE WILL POSSESS

NOW ARE YOU ANY BETTER THAN BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR KING OF MOAB

DID HE EVER CONTEND AGAINST ISRAEL OR DID HE EVER GO TO WAR WITH THEM

WHILE ISRAEL LIVED IN HESHBON AND ITS VILLAGES AND IN AROER AND ITS VILLAGES AND IN ALL THE CITIES THAT ARE ON THE BANKS OF THE ARNON  YEARS WHY DID YOU NOT DELIVER THEM WITHIN THAT TIME

I THEREFORE HAVE NOT SINNED AGAINST YOU AND YOU DO ME WRONG BY MAKING WAR ON ME

THE LORD THE JUDGE DECIDE THIS DAY BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THE PEOPLE OF AMMON

 BUT THE KING OF THE AMMONITES DID NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF JEPHTHAH THAT HE SENT TO HIM

THEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WAS UPON JEPHTHAH AND HE PASSED THROUGH GILEAD AND MANASSEH AND PASSED ON TO MIZPAH OF GILEAD AND FROM MIZPAH OF GILEAD HE PASSED ON TO THE AMMONITES

AND JEPHTHAH MADE A VOW TO THE LORD AND SAID IF YOU WILL GIVE THE AMMONITES INTO MY HAND THEN WHATEVER COMES OUT FROM THE DOORS OF MY HOUSE TO MEET ME WHEN I RETURN IN PEACE FROM THE AMMONITES SHALL BE THE LORD'S AND I WILL OFFER IT UP FOR A BURNT OFFERING

 SO JEPHTHAH CROSSED OVER TO THE AMMONITES TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM AND THE LORD GAVE THEM INTO HIS HAND

AND HE STRUCK THEM FROM AROER TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MINNITH TWENTY CITIES AND AS FAR AS ABELKERAMIM WITH A GREAT BLOW

SO THE AMMONITES WERE SUBDUED BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEN JEPHTHAH CAME TO HIS HOME AT MIZPAH

AND BEHOLD HIS DAUGHTER CAME OUT TO MEET HIM WITH TAMBOURINES AND WITH DANCES

SHE WAS HIS ONLY CHILD; BESIDE HER HE HAD NEITHER SON NOR DAUGHTER

AND AS SOON AS HE SAW HER HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND SAID ALAS MY DAUGHTER

YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME VERY LOW AND YOU HAVE BECOME THE CAUSE OF GREAT TROUBLE TO ME

FOR I HAVE OPENED MY MOUTH TO THE LORD AND I CANNOT TAKE BACK MY VOW

 AND SHE SAID TO HIM MY FATHER YOU HAVE OPENED YOUR MOUTH TO THE LORD; DO TO ME ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS GONE OUT OF YOUR MOUTH NOW THAT THE LORD HAS AVENGED YOU ON YOUR ENEMIES ON THE AMMONITES

 SO SHE SAID TO HER FATHER LET THIS THING BE DONE FOR ME LEAVE ME ALONE TWO MONTHS THAT I MAY GO UP AND DOWN ON THE MOUNTAINS AND WEEP FOR MY VIRGINITY I AND MY COMPANIONS

 SO HE SAID GO

 THEN HE SENT HER AWAY FOR TWO MONTHS AND SHE DEPARTED SHE AND HER COMPANIONS AND WEPT FOR HER VIRGINITY ON THE MOUNTAINS

AND AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS SHE RETURNED TO HER FATHER WHO DID WITH HER ACCORDING TO HIS VOW THAT HE HAD MADE

SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN A MAN AND IT BECAME A CUSTOM IN ISRAEL THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF ISRAEL WENT YEAR BY YEAR TO LAMENT THE DAUGHTER OF JEPHTHAH THE GILEADITE FOUR DAYS IN THE YEAR

THE MEN OF EPHRAIM WERE CALLED TO ARMS AND THEY CROSSED TO ZAPHON AND SAID TO JEPHTHAH WHY DID YOU CROSS OVER TO FIGHT AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND DID NOT CALL US TO GO WITH YOU

WE WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE OVER YOU WITH FIRE

 AND JEPHTHAH SAID TO THEM I AND MY PEOPLE HAD A GREAT DISPUTE WITH THE AMMONITES AND WHEN I CALLED YOU YOU DID NOT SAVE ME FROM THEIR HAND

AND WHEN I SAW THAT YOU WOULD NOT SAVE ME I TOOK MY LIFE IN MY HAND AND CROSSED OVER AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND THE LORD GAVE THEM INTO MY HAND

WHY THEN HAVE YOU COME UP TO ME THIS DAY TO FIGHT AGAINST ME

 THEN JEPHTHAH GATHERED ALL THE MEN OF GILEAD AND FOUGHT WITH EPHRAIM

AND THE MEN OF GILEAD STRUCK EPHRAIM BECAUSE THEY SAID YOU ARE FUGITIVES OF EPHRAIM YOU GILEADITES IN THE MIDST OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH

 AND THE GILEADITES CAPTURED THE FORDS OF THE JORDAN AGAINST THE EPHRAIMITES

AND WHEN ANY OF THE FUGITIVES OF EPHRAIM SAID LET ME GO OVER THE MEN OF GILEAD SAID TO HIM ARE YOU AN EPHRAIMITE

 WHEN HE SAID NO THEY SAID TO HIM THEN SAY SHIBBOLETH AND HE SAID SIBBOLETH FOR HE COULD NOT PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT

THEN THEY SEIZED HIM AND SLAUGHTERED HIM AT THE FORDS OF THE JORDAN

AT THAT TIME  OF THE EPHRAIMITES FELL

JEPHTHAH JUDGED ISRAEL SIX YEARS

THEN JEPHTHAH THE GILEADITE DIED AND WAS BURIED IN HIS CITY IN GILEAD

AFTER HIM IBZAN OF BETHLEHEM JUDGED ISRAEL

HE HAD THIRTY SONS AND THIRTY DAUGHTERS HE GAVE IN MARRIAGE OUTSIDE HIS CLAN AND THIRTY DAUGHTERS HE BROUGHT IN FROM OUTSIDE FOR HIS SONS

AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL SEVEN YEARS

THEN IBZAN DIED AND WAS BURIED AT BETHLEHEM

AFTER HIM ELON THE ZEBULUNITE JUDGED ISRAEL AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL TEN YEARS

THEN ELON THE ZEBULUNITE DIED AND WAS BURIED AT AIJALON IN THE LAND OF ZEBULUN

AFTER HIM ABDON THE SON OF HILLEL THE PIRATHONITE JUDGED ISRAEL

HE HAD FORTY SONS AND THIRTY GRANDSONS WHO RODE ON SEVENTY DONKEYS AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL EIGHT YEARS

THEN ABDON THE SON OF HILLEL THE PIRATHONITE DIED AND WAS BURIED AT PIRATHON IN THE LAND OF EPHRAIM IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMALEKITES

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AGAIN DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD SO THE LORD GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES FOR FORTY YEARS

THERE WAS A CERTAIN MAN OF ZORAH OF THE TRIBE OF THE DANITES WHOSE NAME WAS MANOAH

AND HIS WIFE WAS BARREN AND HAD NO CHILDREN

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO THE WOMAN AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YOU ARE BARREN AND HAVE NOT BORNE CHILDREN BUT YOU SHALL CONCEIVE AND BEAR A SON

THEREFORE BE CAREFUL AND DRINK NO WINE OR STRONG DRINK AND EAT NOTHING UNCLEAN FOR BEHOLD YOU SHALL CONCEIVE AND BEAR A SON

NO RAZOR SHALL COME UPON HIS HEAD FOR THE CHILD SHALL BE A NAZIRITE TO GOD FROM THE WOMB AND HE SHALL BEGIN TO SAVE ISRAEL FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

 THEN THE WOMAN CAME AND TOLD HER HUSBAND A MAN OF GOD CAME TO ME AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE ANGEL OF GOD VERY AWESOME

I DID NOT ASK HIM WHERE HE WAS FROM AND HE DID NOT TELL ME HIS NAME BUT HE SAID TO ME 'BEHOLD YOU SHALL CONCEIVE AND BEAR A SON

SO THEN DRINK NO WINE OR STRONG DRINK AND EAT NOTHING UNCLEAN FOR THE CHILD SHALL BE A NAZIRITE TO GOD FROM THE WOMB TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH

' THEN MANOAH PRAYED TO THE LORD AND SAID O LORD PLEASE LET THE MAN OF GOD WHOM YOU SENT COME AGAIN TO US AND TEACH US WHAT WE ARE TO DO WITH THE CHILD WHO WILL BE BORN

 AND GOD LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF MANOAH AND THE ANGEL OF GOD CAME AGAIN TO THE WOMAN AS SHE SAT IN THE FIELD

BUT MANOAH HER HUSBAND WAS NOT WITH HER

SO THE WOMAN RAN QUICKLY AND TOLD HER HUSBAND BEHOLD THE MAN WHO CAME TO ME THE OTHER DAY HAS APPEARED TO ME

 AND MANOAH AROSE AND WENT AFTER HIS WIFE AND CAME TO THE MAN AND SAID TO HIM ARE YOU THE MAN WHO SPOKE TO THIS WOMAN

 AND HE SAID I AM

 AND MANOAH SAID NOW WHEN YOUR WORDS COME TRUE WHAT IS TO BE THE CHILD'S MANNER OF LIFE AND WHAT IS HIS MISSION

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO MANOAH OF ALL THAT I SAID TO THE WOMAN LET HER BE CAREFUL

SHE MAY NOT EAT OF ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM THE VINE NEITHER LET HER DRINK WINE OR STRONG DRINK OR EAT ANY UNCLEAN THING

ALL THAT I COMMANDED HER LET HER OBSERVE

 MANOAH SAID TO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PLEASE LET US DETAIN YOU AND PREPARE A YOUNG GOAT FOR YOU

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO MANOAH IF YOU DETAIN ME I WILL NOT EAT OF YOUR FOOD

BUT IF YOU PREPARE A BURNT OFFERING THEN OFFER IT TO THE LORD

 FOR MANOAH DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD

 AND MANOAH SAID TO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WHAT IS YOUR NAME SO THAT WHEN YOUR WORDS COME TRUE WE MAY HONOR YOU

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU ASK MY NAME SEEING IT IS WONDERFUL

 SO MANOAH TOOK THE YOUNG GOAT WITH THE GRAIN OFFERING AND OFFERED IT ON THE ROCK TO THE LORD TO THE ONE WHO WORKS WONDERS AND MANOAH AND HIS WIFE WERE WATCHING

AND WHEN THE FLAME WENT UP TOWARD HEAVEN FROM THE ALTAR THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT UP IN THE FLAME OF THE ALTAR

NOW MANOAH AND HIS WIFE WERE WATCHING AND THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED NO MORE TO MANOAH AND TO HIS WIFE

THEN MANOAH KNEW THAT HE WAS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD

AND MANOAH SAID TO HIS WIFE WE SHALL SURELY DIE FOR WE HAVE SEEN GOD

 BUT HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM IF THE LORD HAD MEANT TO KILL US HE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED A BURNT OFFERING AND A GRAIN OFFERING AT OUR HANDS OR SHOWN US ALL THESE THINGS OR NOW ANNOUNCED TO US SUCH THINGS AS THESE

 AND THE WOMAN BORE A SON AND CALLED HIS NAME SAMSON

AND THE YOUNG MAN GREW AND THE LORD BLESSED HIM

AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD BEGAN TO STIR HIM IN MAHANEHDAN BETWEEN ZORAH AND ESHTAOL

SAMSON WENT DOWN TO TIMNAH AND AT TIMNAH HE SAW ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE PHILISTINES

THEN HE CAME UP AND TOLD HIS FATHER AND MOTHER I SAW ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE PHILISTINES AT TIMNAH

NOW GET HER FOR ME AS MY WIFE

 BUT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SAID TO HIM IS THERE NOT A WOMAN AMONG THE DAUGHTERS OF YOUR RELATIVES OR AMONG ALL OUR PEOPLE THAT YOU MUST GO TO TAKE A WIFE FROM THE UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINES

 BUT SAMSON SAID TO HIS FATHER GET HER FOR ME FOR SHE IS RIGHT IN MY EYES

 HIS FATHER AND MOTHER DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS FROM THE LORD FOR HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

AT THAT TIME THE PHILISTINES RULED OVER ISRAEL

THEN SAMSON WENT DOWN WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER TO TIMNAH AND THEY CAME TO THE VINEYARDS OF TIMNAH

AND BEHOLD A YOUNG LION CAME TOWARD HIM ROARING

THEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RUSHED UPON HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOTHING IN HIS HAND HE TORE THE LION IN PIECES AS ONE TEARS A YOUNG GOAT

BUT HE DID NOT TELL HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER WHAT HE HAD DONE

THEN HE WENT DOWN AND TALKED WITH THE WOMAN AND SHE WAS RIGHT IN SAMSON'S EYES

AFTER SOME DAYS HE RETURNED TO TAKE HER

AND HE TURNED ASIDE TO SEE THE CARCASS OF THE LION AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A SWARM OF BEES IN THE BODY OF THE LION AND HONEY

HE SCRAPED IT OUT INTO HIS HANDS AND WENT ON EATING AS HE WENT

AND HE CAME TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND GAVE SOME TO THEM AND THEY ATE

BUT HE DID NOT TELL THEM THAT HE HAD SCRAPED THE HONEY FROM THE CARCASS OF THE LION

HIS FATHER WENT DOWN TO THE WOMAN AND SAMSON PREPARED A FEAST THERE FOR SO THE YOUNG MEN USED TO DO

AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE SAW HIM THEY BROUGHT THIRTY COMPANIONS TO BE WITH HIM

AND SAMSON SAID TO THEM LET ME NOW PUT A RIDDLE TO YOU

IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT IT IS WITHIN THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE FEAST AND FIND IT OUT THEN I WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY LINEN GARMENTS AND THIRTY CHANGES OF CLOTHES BUT IF YOU CANNOT TELL ME WHAT IT IS THEN YOU SHALL GIVE ME THIRTY LINEN GARMENTS AND THIRTY CHANGES OF CLOTHES

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM PUT YOUR RIDDLE THAT WE MAY HEAR IT

 AND HE SAID TO THEM OUT OF THE EATER CAME SOMETHING TO EAT

OUT OF THE STRONG CAME SOMETHING SWEET

AND IN THREE DAYS THEY COULD NOT SOLVE THE RIDDLE

ON THE FOURTH DAY THEY SAID TO SAMSON'S WIFE ENTICE YOUR HUSBAND TO TELL US WHAT THE RIDDLE IS LEST WE BURN YOU AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE WITH FIRE

HAVE YOU INVITED US HERE TO IMPOVERISH US

 AND SAMSON'S WIFE WEPT OVER HIM AND SAID YOU ONLY HATE ME; YOU DO NOT LOVE ME

YOU HAVE PUT A RIDDLE TO MY PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHAT IT IS

 AND HE SAID TO HER BEHOLD I HAVE NOT TOLD MY FATHER NOR MY MOTHER AND SHALL I TELL YOU

 SHE WEPT BEFORE HIM THE SEVEN DAYS THAT THEIR FEAST LASTED AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE TOLD HER BECAUSE SHE PRESSED HIM HARD

THEN SHE TOLD THE RIDDLE TO HER PEOPLE

AND THE MEN OF THE CITY SAID TO HIM ON THE SEVENTH DAY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN WHAT IS SWEETER THAN HONEY

WHAT IS STRONGER THAN A LION

AND HE SAID TO THEM IF YOU HAD NOT PLOWED WITH MY HEIFER YOU WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND OUT MY RIDDLE

 AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RUSHED UPON HIM AND HE WENT DOWN TO ASHKELON AND STRUCK DOWN THIRTY MEN OF THE TOWN AND TOOK THEIR SPOIL AND GAVE THE GARMENTS TO THOSE WHO HAD TOLD THE RIDDLE

IN HOT ANGER HE WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

AND SAMSON'S WIFE WAS GIVEN TO HIS COMPANION WHO HAD BEEN HIS BEST MAN

AFTER SOME DAYS AT THE TIME OF WHEAT HARVEST SAMSON WENT TO VISIT HIS WIFE WITH A YOUNG GOAT

AND HE SAID I WILL GO IN TO MY WIFE IN THE CHAMBER

 BUT HER FATHER WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO IN

AND HER FATHER SAID I REALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU UTTERLY HATED HER SO I GAVE HER TO YOUR COMPANION

IS NOT HER YOUNGER SISTER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE

PLEASE TAKE HER INSTEAD

 AND SAMSON SAID TO THEM THIS TIME I SHALL BE INNOCENT IN REGARD TO THE PHILISTINES WHEN I DO THEM HARM

 SO SAMSON WENT AND CAUGHT  FOXES AND TOOK TORCHES

AND HE TURNED THEM TAIL TO TAIL AND PUT A TORCH BETWEEN EACH PAIR OF TAILS

AND WHEN HE HAD SET FIRE TO THE TORCHES HE LET THE FOXES GO INTO THE STANDING GRAIN OF THE PHILISTINES AND SET FIRE TO THE STACKED GRAIN AND THE STANDING GRAIN AS WELL AS THE OLIVE ORCHARDS

THEN THE PHILISTINES SAID WHO HAS DONE THIS

 AND THEY SAID SAMSON THE SONINLAW OF THE TIMNITE BECAUSE HE HAS TAKEN HIS WIFE AND GIVEN HER TO HIS COMPANION

 AND THE PHILISTINES CAME UP AND BURNED HER AND HER FATHER WITH FIRE

AND SAMSON SAID TO THEM IF THIS IS WHAT YOU DO I SWEAR I WILL BE AVENGED ON YOU AND AFTER THAT I WILL QUIT

 AND HE STRUCK THEM HIP AND THIGH WITH A GREAT BLOW AND HE WENT DOWN AND STAYED IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK OF ETAM

THEN THE PHILISTINES CAME UP AND ENCAMPED IN JUDAH AND MADE A RAID ON LEHI

AND THE MEN OF JUDAH SAID WHY HAVE YOU COME UP AGAINST US

 THEY SAID WE HAVE COME UP TO BIND SAMSON TO DO TO HIM AS HE DID TO US

 THEN  MEN OF JUDAH WENT DOWN TO THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK OF ETAM AND SAID TO SAMSON DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE PHILISTINES ARE RULERS OVER US

WHAT THEN IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE TO US

 AND HE SAID TO THEM AS THEY DID TO ME SO HAVE I DONE TO THEM

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM WE HAVE COME DOWN TO BIND YOU THAT WE MAY GIVE YOU INTO THE HANDS OF THE PHILISTINES

 AND SAMSON SAID TO THEM SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT ATTACK ME YOURSELVES

 THEY SAID TO HIM NO; WE WILL ONLY BIND YOU AND GIVE YOU INTO THEIR HANDS

WE WILL SURELY NOT KILL YOU

 SO THEY BOUND HIM WITH TWO NEW ROPES AND BROUGHT HIM UP FROM THE ROCK

WHEN HE CAME TO LEHI THE PHILISTINES CAME SHOUTING TO MEET HIM

THEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RUSHED UPON HIM AND THE ROPES THAT WERE ON HIS ARMS BECAME AS FLAX THAT HAS CAUGHT FIRE AND HIS BONDS MELTED OFF HIS HANDS

AND HE FOUND A FRESH JAWBONE OF A DONKEY AND PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK IT AND WITH IT HE STRUCK  MEN

AND SAMSON SAID WITH THE JAWBONE OF A DONKEY HEAPS UPON HEAPS WITH THE JAWBONE OF A DONKEY HAVE I STRUCK DOWN A THOUSAND MEN

 AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING HE THREW AWAY THE JAWBONE OUT OF HIS HAND

AND THAT PLACE WAS CALLED RAMATHLEHI

AND HE WAS VERY THIRSTY AND HE CALLED UPON THE LORD AND SAID YOU HAVE GRANTED THIS GREAT SALVATION BY THE HAND OF YOUR SERVANT AND SHALL I NOW DIE OF THIRST AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE UNCIRCUMCISED

 AND GOD SPLIT OPEN THE HOLLOW PLACE THAT IS AT LEHI AND WATER CAME OUT FROM IT

AND WHEN HE DRANK HIS SPIRIT RETURNED AND HE REVIVED

THEREFORE THE NAME OF IT WAS CALLED ENHAKKORE; IT IS AT LEHI TO THIS DAY

AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL IN THE DAYS OF THE PHILISTINES TWENTY YEARS

SAMSON WENT TO GAZA AND THERE HE SAW A PROSTITUTE AND HE WENT IN TO HER

THE GAZITES WERE TOLD SAMSON HAS COME HERE

 AND THEY SURROUNDED THE PLACE AND SET AN AMBUSH FOR HIM ALL NIGHT AT THE GATE OF THE CITY

THEY KEPT QUIET ALL NIGHT SAYING LET US WAIT TILL THE LIGHT OF THE MORNING; THEN WE WILL KILL HIM

 BUT SAMSON LAY TILL MIDNIGHT AND AT MIDNIGHT HE AROSE AND TOOK HOLD OF THE DOORS OF THE GATE OF THE CITY AND THE TWO POSTS AND PULLED THEM UP BAR AND ALL AND PUT THEM ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED THEM TO THE TOP OF THE HILL THAT IS IN FRONT OF HEBRON

AFTER THIS HE LOVED A WOMAN IN THE VALLEY OF SOREK WHOSE NAME WAS DELILAH

AND THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES CAME UP TO HER AND SAID TO HER SEDUCE HIM AND SEE WHERE HIS GREAT STRENGTH LIES AND BY WHAT MEANS WE MAY OVERPOWER HIM THAT WE MAY BIND HIM TO HUMBLE HIM

AND WE WILL EACH GIVE YOU  PIECES OF SILVER

 SO DELILAH SAID TO SAMSON PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOUR GREAT STRENGTH LIES AND HOW YOU MIGHT BE BOUND THAT ONE COULD SUBDUE YOU

 SAMSON SAID TO HER IF THEY BIND ME WITH SEVEN FRESH BOWSTRINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DRIED THEN I SHALL BECOME WEAK AND BE LIKE ANY OTHER MAN

 THEN THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES BROUGHT UP TO HER SEVEN FRESH BOWSTRINGS THAT HAD NOT BEEN DRIED AND SHE BOUND HIM WITH THEM

NOW SHE HAD MEN LYING IN AMBUSH IN AN INNER CHAMBER

AND SHE SAID TO HIM THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON YOU SAMSON

 BUT HE SNAPPED THE BOWSTRINGS AS A THREAD OF FLAX SNAPS WHEN IT TOUCHES THE FIRE

SO THE SECRET OF HIS STRENGTH WAS NOT KNOWN

THEN DELILAH SAID TO SAMSON BEHOLD YOU HAVE MOCKED ME AND TOLD ME LIES

PLEASE TELL ME HOW YOU MIGHT BE BOUND

 AND HE SAID TO HER IF THEY BIND ME WITH NEW ROPES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USED THEN I SHALL BECOME WEAK AND BE LIKE ANY OTHER MAN

 SO DELILAH TOOK NEW ROPES AND BOUND HIM WITH THEM AND SAID TO HIM THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON YOU SAMSON

 AND THE MEN LYING IN AMBUSH WERE IN AN INNER CHAMBER

BUT HE SNAPPED THE ROPES OFF HIS ARMS LIKE A THREAD

THEN DELILAH SAID TO SAMSON UNTIL NOW YOU HAVE MOCKED ME AND TOLD ME LIES

TELL ME HOW YOU MIGHT BE BOUND

 AND HE SAID TO HER IF YOU WEAVE THE SEVEN LOCKS OF MY HEAD WITH THE WEB AND FASTEN IT TIGHT WITH THE PIN THEN I SHALL BECOME WEAK AND BE LIKE ANY OTHER MAN

 SO WHILE HE SLEPT DELILAH TOOK THE SEVEN LOCKS OF HIS HEAD AND WOVE THEM INTO THE WEB

AND SHE MADE THEM TIGHT WITH THE PIN AND SAID TO HIM THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON YOU SAMSON

 BUT HE AWOKE FROM HIS SLEEP AND PULLED AWAY THE PIN THE LOOM AND THE WEB

AND SHE SAID TO HIM HOW CAN YOU SAY 'I LOVE YOU' WHEN YOUR HEART IS NOT WITH ME

YOU HAVE MOCKED ME THESE THREE TIMES AND YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE YOUR GREAT STRENGTH LIES

 AND WHEN SHE PRESSED HIM HARD WITH HER WORDS DAY AFTER DAY AND URGED HIM HIS SOUL WAS VEXED TO DEATH

AND HE TOLD HER ALL HIS HEART AND SAID TO HER A RAZOR HAS NEVER COME UPON MY HEAD FOR I HAVE BEEN A NAZIRITE TO GOD FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB

IF MY HEAD IS SHAVED THEN MY STRENGTH WILL LEAVE ME AND I SHALL BECOME WEAK AND BE LIKE ANY OTHER MAN

 WHEN DELILAH SAW THAT HE HAD TOLD HER ALL HIS HEART SHE SENT AND CALLED THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES SAYING COME UP AGAIN FOR HE HAS TOLD ME ALL HIS HEART

 THEN THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES CAME UP TO HER AND BROUGHT THE MONEY IN THEIR HANDS

SHE MADE HIM SLEEP ON HER KNEES

AND SHE CALLED A MAN AND HAD HIM SHAVE OFF THE SEVEN LOCKS OF HIS HEAD

THEN SHE BEGAN TO TORMENT HIM AND HIS STRENGTH LEFT HIM

AND SHE SAID THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON YOU SAMSON

 AND HE AWOKE FROM HIS SLEEP AND SAID I WILL GO OUT AS AT OTHER TIMES AND SHAKE MYSELF FREE

 BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE LORD HAD LEFT HIM

AND THE PHILISTINES SEIZED HIM AND GOUGED OUT HIS EYES AND BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO GAZA AND BOUND HIM WITH BRONZE SHACKLES

AND HE GROUND AT THE MILL IN THE PRISON

BUT THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD BEGAN TO GROW AGAIN AFTER IT HAD BEEN SHAVED

NOW THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES GATHERED TO OFFER A GREAT SACRIFICE TO DAGON THEIR GOD AND TO REJOICE AND THEY SAID OUR GOD HAS GIVEN SAMSON OUR ENEMY INTO OUR HAND

 AND WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW HIM THEY PRAISED THEIR GOD

FOR THEY SAID OUR GOD HAS GIVEN OUR ENEMY INTO OUR HAND THE RAVAGER OF OUR COUNTRY WHO HAS KILLED MANY OF US

 AND WHEN THEIR HEARTS WERE MERRY THEY SAID CALL SAMSON THAT HE MAY ENTERTAIN US

 SO THEY CALLED SAMSON OUT OF THE PRISON AND HE ENTERTAINED THEM

THEY MADE HIM STAND BETWEEN THE PILLARS

AND SAMSON SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HELD HIM BY THE HAND LET ME FEEL THE PILLARS ON WHICH THE HOUSE RESTS THAT I MAY LEAN AGAINST THEM

 NOW THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN

ALL THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES WERE THERE AND ON THE ROOF THERE WERE ABOUT  MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOOKED ON WHILE SAMSON ENTERTAINED

THEN SAMSON CALLED TO THE LORD AND SAID O LORD GOD PLEASE REMEMBER ME AND PLEASE STRENGTHEN ME ONLY THIS ONCE O GOD THAT I MAY BE AVENGED ON THE PHILISTINES FOR MY TWO EYES

 AND SAMSON GRASPED THE TWO MIDDLE PILLARS ON WHICH THE HOUSE RESTED AND HE LEANED HIS WEIGHT AGAINST THEM HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE ONE AND HIS LEFT HAND ON THE OTHER

AND SAMSON SAID LET ME DIE WITH THE PHILISTINES

 THEN HE BOWED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AND THE HOUSE FELL UPON THE LORDS AND UPON ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT

SO THE DEAD WHOM HE KILLED AT HIS DEATH WERE MORE THAN THOSE WHOM HE HAD KILLED DURING HIS LIFE

THEN HIS BROTHERS AND ALL HIS FAMILY CAME DOWN AND TOOK HIM AND BROUGHT HIM UP AND BURIED HIM BETWEEN ZORAH AND ESHTAOL IN THE TOMB OF MANOAH HIS FATHER

HE HAD JUDGED ISRAEL TWENTY YEARS

THERE WAS A MAN OF THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM WHOSE NAME WAS MICAH

AND HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER THE  PIECES OF SILVER THAT WERE TAKEN FROM YOU ABOUT WHICH YOU UTTERED A CURSE AND ALSO SPOKE IT IN MY EARS BEHOLD THE SILVER IS WITH ME; I TOOK IT

 AND HIS MOTHER SAID BLESSED BE MY SON BY THE LORD

 AND HE RESTORED THE  PIECES OF SILVER TO HIS MOTHER

AND HIS MOTHER SAID I DEDICATE THE SILVER TO THE LORD FROM MY HAND FOR MY SON TO MAKE A CARVED IMAGE AND A METAL IMAGE

NOW THEREFORE I WILL RESTORE IT TO YOU

 SO WHEN HE RESTORED THE MONEY TO HIS MOTHER HIS MOTHER TOOK  PIECES OF SILVER AND GAVE IT TO THE SILVERSMITH WHO MADE IT INTO A CARVED IMAGE AND A METAL IMAGE

AND IT WAS IN THE HOUSE OF MICAH

AND THE MAN MICAH HAD A SHRINE AND HE MADE AN EPHOD AND HOUSEHOLD GODS AND ORDAINED ONE OF HIS SONS WHO BECAME HIS PRIEST

IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO KING IN ISRAEL

EVERYONE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES

NOW THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH OF THE FAMILY OF JUDAH WHO WAS A LEVITE AND HE SOJOURNED THERE

AND THE MAN DEPARTED FROM THE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH TO SOJOURN WHERE HE COULD FIND A PLACE

AND AS HE JOURNEYED HE CAME TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM TO THE HOUSE OF MICAH

AND MICAH SAID TO HIM WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 AND HE SAID TO HIM I AM A LEVITE OF BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH AND I AM GOING TO SOJOURN WHERE I MAY FIND A PLACE

 AND MICAH SAID TO HIM STAY WITH ME AND BE TO ME A FATHER AND A PRIEST AND I WILL GIVE YOU TEN PIECES OF SILVER A YEAR AND A SUIT OF CLOTHES AND YOUR LIVING

 AND THE LEVITE WENT IN

AND THE LEVITE WAS CONTENT TO DWELL WITH THE MAN AND THE YOUNG MAN BECAME TO HIM LIKE ONE OF HIS SONS

AND MICAH ORDAINED THE LEVITE AND THE YOUNG MAN BECAME HIS PRIEST AND WAS IN THE HOUSE OF MICAH

THEN MICAH SAID NOW I KNOW THAT THE LORD WILL PROSPER ME BECAUSE I HAVE A LEVITE AS PRIEST

IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO KING IN ISRAEL

AND IN THOSE DAYS THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF DAN WAS SEEKING FOR ITSELF AN INHERITANCE TO DWELL IN FOR UNTIL THEN NO INHERITANCE AMONG THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL HAD FALLEN TO THEM

SO THE PEOPLE OF DAN SENT FIVE ABLE MEN FROM THE WHOLE NUMBER OF THEIR TRIBE FROM ZORAH AND FROM ESHTAOL TO SPY OUT THE LAND AND TO EXPLORE IT

AND THEY SAID TO THEM GO AND EXPLORE THE LAND

 AND THEY CAME TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM TO THE HOUSE OF MICAH AND LODGED THERE

WHEN THEY WERE BY THE HOUSE OF MICAH THEY RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF THE YOUNG LEVITE

AND THEY TURNED ASIDE AND SAID TO HIM WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE

WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS PLACE

WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS HERE

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THIS IS HOW MICAH DEALT WITH ME HE HAS HIRED ME AND I HAVE BECOME HIS PRIEST

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM INQUIRE OF GOD PLEASE THAT WE MAY KNOW WHETHER THE JOURNEY ON WHICH WE ARE SETTING OUT WILL SUCCEED

 AND THE PRIEST SAID TO THEM GO IN PEACE

THE JOURNEY ON WHICH YOU GO IS UNDER THE EYE OF THE LORD

 THEN THE FIVE MEN DEPARTED AND CAME TO LAISH AND SAW THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE HOW THEY LIVED IN SECURITY AFTER THE MANNER OF THE SIDONIANS QUIET AND UNSUSPECTING LACKING NOTHING THAT IS IN THE EARTH AND POSSESSING WEALTH AND HOW THEY WERE FAR FROM THE SIDONIANS AND HAD NO DEALINGS WITH ANYONE

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THEIR BROTHERS AT ZORAH AND ESHTAOL THEIR BROTHERS SAID TO THEM WHAT DO YOU REPORT

 THEY SAID ARISE AND LET US GO UP AGAINST THEM FOR WE HAVE SEEN THE LAND AND BEHOLD IT IS VERY GOOD

AND WILL YOU DO NOTHING

DO NOT BE SLOW TO GO TO ENTER IN AND POSSESS THE LAND

AS SOON AS YOU GO YOU WILL COME TO AN UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE

THE LAND IS SPACIOUS FOR GOD HAS GIVEN IT INTO YOUR HANDS A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO LACK OF ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE EARTH

 SO  MEN OF THE TRIBE OF DAN ARMED WITH WEAPONS OF WAR SET OUT FROM ZORAH AND ESHTAOL AND WENT UP AND ENCAMPED AT KIRIATHJEARIM IN JUDAH

ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT PLACE IS CALLED MAHANEHDAN TO THIS DAY; BEHOLD IT IS WEST OF KIRIATHJEARIM

AND THEY PASSED ON FROM THERE TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND CAME TO THE HOUSE OF MICAH

THEN THE FIVE MEN WHO HAD GONE TO SCOUT OUT THE COUNTRY OF LAISH SAID TO THEIR BROTHERS DO YOU KNOW THAT IN THESE HOUSES THERE ARE AN EPHOD HOUSEHOLD GODS A CARVED IMAGE AND A METAL IMAGE

NOW THEREFORE CONSIDER WHAT YOU WILL DO

 AND THEY TURNED ASIDE THERE AND CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE YOUNG LEVITE AT THE HOME OF MICAH AND ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS WELFARE

NOW THE  MEN OF THE DANITES ARMED WITH THEIR WEAPONS OF WAR STOOD BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE

AND THE FIVE MEN WHO HAD GONE TO SCOUT OUT THE LAND WENT UP AND ENTERED AND TOOK THE CARVED IMAGE THE EPHOD THE HOUSEHOLD GODS AND THE METAL IMAGE WHILE THE PRIEST STOOD BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE WITH THE  MEN ARMED WITH WEAPONS OF WAR

AND WHEN THESE WENT INTO MICAH'S HOUSE AND TOOK THE CARVED IMAGE THE EPHOD THE HOUSEHOLD GODS AND THE METAL IMAGE THE PRIEST SAID TO THEM WHAT ARE YOU DOING

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM KEEP QUIET; PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR MOUTH AND COME WITH US AND BE TO US A FATHER AND A PRIEST

IS IT BETTER FOR YOU TO BE PRIEST TO THE HOUSE OF ONE MAN OR TO BE PRIEST TO A TRIBE AND CLAN IN ISRAEL

 AND THE PRIEST'S HEART WAS GLAD

HE TOOK THE EPHOD AND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS AND THE CARVED IMAGE AND WENT ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE

SO THEY TURNED AND DEPARTED PUTTING THE LITTLE ONES AND THE LIVESTOCK AND THE GOODS IN FRONT OF THEM

WHEN THEY HAD GONE A DISTANCE FROM THE HOME OF MICAH THE MEN WHO WERE IN THE HOUSES NEAR MICAH'S HOUSE WERE CALLED OUT AND THEY OVERTOOK THE PEOPLE OF DAN

AND THEY SHOUTED TO THE PEOPLE OF DAN WHO TURNED AROUND AND SAID TO MICAH WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THAT YOU COME WITH SUCH A COMPANY

 AND HE SAID YOU TAKE MY GODS THAT I MADE AND THE PRIEST AND GO AWAY AND WHAT HAVE I LEFT

HOW THEN DO YOU ASK ME 'WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU

' AND THE PEOPLE OF DAN SAID TO HIM DO NOT LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD AMONG US LEST ANGRY FELLOWS FALL UPON YOU AND YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE WITH THE LIVES OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD

 THEN THE PEOPLE OF DAN WENT THEIR WAY

AND WHEN MICAH SAW THAT THEY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HIM HE TURNED AND WENT BACK TO HIS HOME

BUT THE PEOPLE OF DAN TOOK WHAT MICAH HAD MADE AND THE PRIEST WHO BELONGED TO HIM AND THEY CAME TO LAISH TO A PEOPLE QUIET AND UNSUSPECTING AND STRUCK THEM WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND BURNED THE CITY WITH FIRE

AND THERE WAS NO DELIVERER BECAUSE IT WAS FAR FROM SIDON AND THEY HAD NO DEALINGS WITH ANYONE

IT WAS IN THE VALLEY THAT BELONGS TO BETHREHOB

THEN THEY REBUILT THE CITY AND LIVED IN IT

AND THEY NAMED THE CITY DAN AFTER THE NAME OF DAN THEIR ANCESTOR WHO WAS BORN TO ISRAEL; BUT THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS LAISH AT THE FIRST

AND THE PEOPLE OF DAN SET UP THE CARVED IMAGE FOR THEMSELVES AND JONATHAN THE SON OF GERSHOM SON OF MOSES AND HIS SONS WERE PRIESTS TO THE TRIBE OF THE DANITES UNTIL THE DAY OF THE CAPTIVITY OF THE LAND

SO THEY SET UP MICAH'S CARVED IMAGE THAT HE MADE AS LONG AS THE HOUSE OF GOD WAS AT SHILOH

IN THOSE DAYS WHEN THERE WAS NO KING IN ISRAEL A CERTAIN LEVITE WAS SOJOURNING IN THE REMOTE PARTS OF THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM WHO TOOK TO HIMSELF A CONCUBINE FROM BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH

AND HIS CONCUBINE WAS UNFAITHFUL TO HIM AND SHE WENT AWAY FROM HIM TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE AT BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH AND WAS THERE SOME FOUR MONTHS

THEN HER HUSBAND AROSE AND WENT AFTER HER TO SPEAK KINDLY TO HER AND BRING HER BACK

HE HAD WITH HIM HIS SERVANT AND A COUPLE OF DONKEYS

AND SHE BROUGHT HIM INTO HER FATHER'S HOUSE

AND WHEN THE GIRL'S FATHER SAW HIM HE CAME WITH JOY TO MEET HIM

AND HIS FATHERINLAW THE GIRL'S FATHER MADE HIM STAY AND HE REMAINED WITH HIM THREE DAYS

SO THEY ATE AND DRANK AND SPENT THE NIGHT THERE

AND ON THE FOURTH DAY THEY AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND HE PREPARED TO GO BUT THE GIRL'S FATHER SAID TO HIS SONINLAW STRENGTHEN YOUR HEART WITH A MORSEL OF BREAD AND AFTER THAT YOU MAY GO

 SO THE TWO OF THEM SAT AND ATE AND DRANK TOGETHER

AND THE GIRL'S FATHER SAID TO THE MAN BE PLEASED TO SPEND THE NIGHT AND LET YOUR HEART BE MERRY

 AND WHEN THE MAN ROSE UP TO GO HIS FATHERINLAW PRESSED HIM TILL HE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE AGAIN

AND ON THE FIFTH DAY HE AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO DEPART

AND THE GIRL'S FATHER SAID STRENGTHEN YOUR HEART AND WAIT UNTIL THE DAY DECLINES

 SO THEY ATE BOTH OF THEM

AND WHEN THE MAN AND HIS CONCUBINE AND HIS SERVANT ROSE UP TO DEPART HIS FATHERINLAW THE GIRL'S FATHER SAID TO HIM BEHOLD NOW THE DAY HAS WANED TOWARD EVENING

PLEASE SPEND THE NIGHT

BEHOLD THE DAY DRAWS TO ITS CLOSE

LODGE HERE AND LET YOUR HEART BE MERRY AND TOMORROW YOU SHALL ARISE EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR YOUR JOURNEY AND GO HOME

 BUT THE MAN WOULD NOT SPEND THE NIGHT

HE ROSE UP AND DEPARTED AND ARRIVED OPPOSITE JEBUS THAT IS JERUSALEM

HE HAD WITH HIM A COUPLE OF SADDLED DONKEYS AND HIS CONCUBINE WAS WITH HIM

WHEN THEY WERE NEAR JEBUS THE DAY WAS NEARLY OVER AND THE SERVANT SAID TO HIS MASTER COME NOW LET US TURN ASIDE TO THIS CITY OF THE JEBUSITES AND SPEND THE NIGHT IN IT

 AND HIS MASTER SAID TO HIM WE WILL NOT TURN ASIDE INTO THE CITY OF FOREIGNERS WHO DO NOT BELONG TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BUT WE WILL PASS ON TO GIBEAH

 AND HE SAID TO HIS YOUNG MAN COME AND LET US DRAW NEAR TO ONE OF THESE PLACES AND SPEND THE NIGHT AT GIBEAH OR AT RAMAH

 SO THEY PASSED ON AND WENT THEIR WAY

AND THE SUN WENT DOWN ON THEM NEAR GIBEAH WHICH BELONGS TO BENJAMIN AND THEY TURNED ASIDE THERE TO GO IN AND SPEND THE NIGHT AT GIBEAH

AND HE WENT IN AND SAT DOWN IN THE OPEN SQUARE OF THE CITY FOR NO ONE TOOK THEM INTO HIS HOUSE TO SPEND THE NIGHT

AND BEHOLD AN OLD MAN WAS COMING FROM HIS WORK IN THE FIELD AT EVENING

THE MAN WAS FROM THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND HE WAS SOJOURNING IN GIBEAH

THE MEN OF THE PLACE WERE BENJAMINITES

AND HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW THE TRAVELER IN THE OPEN SQUARE OF THE CITY

AND THE OLD MAN SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING

AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 AND HE SAID TO HIM WE ARE PASSING FROM BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH TO THE REMOTE PARTS OF THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM FROM WHICH I COME

I WENT TO BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH AND I AM GOING TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BUT NO ONE HAS TAKEN ME INTO HIS HOUSE

WE HAVE STRAW AND FEED FOR OUR DONKEYS WITH BREAD AND WINE FOR ME AND YOUR FEMALE SERVANT AND THE YOUNG MAN WITH YOUR SERVANTS

THERE IS NO LACK OF ANYTHING

 AND THE OLD MAN SAID PEACE BE TO YOU; I WILL CARE FOR ALL YOUR WANTS

ONLY DO NOT SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE SQUARE

 SO HE BROUGHT HIM INTO HIS HOUSE AND GAVE THE DONKEYS FEED

AND THEY WASHED THEIR FEET AND ATE AND DRANK

AS THEY WERE MAKING THEIR HEARTS MERRY BEHOLD THE MEN OF THE CITY WORTHLESS FELLOWS SURROUNDED THE HOUSE BEATING ON THE DOOR

AND THEY SAID TO THE OLD MAN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BRING OUT THE MAN WHO CAME INTO YOUR HOUSE THAT WE MAY KNOW HIM

 AND THE MAN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO THEM AND SAID TO THEM NO MY BROTHERS DO NOT ACT SO WICKEDLY; SINCE THIS MAN HAS COME INTO MY HOUSE DO NOT DO THIS VILE THING

BEHOLD HERE ARE MY VIRGIN DAUGHTER AND HIS CONCUBINE

LET ME BRING THEM OUT NOW

VIOLATE THEM AND DO WITH THEM WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU BUT AGAINST THIS MAN DO NOT DO THIS OUTRAGEOUS THING

 BUT THE MEN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM

SO THE MAN SEIZED HIS CONCUBINE AND MADE HER GO OUT TO THEM

AND THEY KNEW HER AND ABUSED HER ALL NIGHT UNTIL THE MORNING

AND AS THE DAWN BEGAN TO BREAK THEY LET HER GO

AND AS MORNING APPEARED THE WOMAN CAME AND FELL DOWN AT THE DOOR OF THE MAN'S HOUSE WHERE HER MASTER WAS UNTIL IT WAS LIGHT

AND HER MASTER ROSE UP IN THE MORNING AND WHEN HE OPENED THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE AND WENT OUT TO GO ON HIS WAY BEHOLD THERE WAS HIS CONCUBINE LYING AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WITH HER HANDS ON THE THRESHOLD

HE SAID TO HER GET UP LET US BE GOING

 BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER

THEN HE PUT HER ON THE DONKEY AND THE MAN ROSE UP AND WENT AWAY TO HIS HOME

AND WHEN HE ENTERED HIS HOUSE HE TOOK A KNIFE AND TAKING HOLD OF HIS CONCUBINE HE DIVIDED HER LIMB BY LIMB INTO TWELVE PIECES AND SENT HER THROUGHOUT ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL

AND ALL WHO SAW IT SAID SUCH A THING HAS NEVER HAPPENED OR BEEN SEEN FROM THE DAY THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT UNTIL THIS DAY; CONSIDER IT TAKE COUNSEL AND SPEAK

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME OUT FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA INCLUDING THE LAND OF GILEAD AND THE CONGREGATION ASSEMBLED AS ONE MAN TO THE LORD AT MIZPAH

AND THE CHIEFS OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD  MEN ON FOOT THAT DREW THE SWORD

NOW THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN HEARD THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD GONE UP TO MIZPAH

 AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TELL US HOW DID THIS EVIL HAPPEN

 AND THE LEVITE THE HUSBAND OF THE WOMAN WHO WAS MURDERED ANSWERED AND SAID I CAME TO GIBEAH THAT BELONGS TO BENJAMIN I AND MY CONCUBINE TO SPEND THE NIGHT

AND THE LEADERS OF GIBEAH ROSE AGAINST ME AND SURROUNDED THE HOUSE AGAINST ME BY NIGHT

THEY MEANT TO KILL ME AND THEY VIOLATED MY CONCUBINE AND SHE IS DEAD

SO I TOOK HOLD OF MY CONCUBINE AND CUT HER IN PIECES AND SENT HER THROUGHOUT ALL THE COUNTRY OF THE INHERITANCE OF ISRAEL FOR THEY HAVE COMMITTED ABOMINATION AND OUTRAGE IN ISRAEL

BEHOLD YOU PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ALL OF YOU GIVE YOUR ADVICE AND COUNSEL HERE

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE AROSE AS ONE MAN SAYING NONE OF US WILL GO TO HIS TENT AND NONE OF US WILL RETURN TO HIS HOUSE

BUT NOW THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO TO GIBEAH WE WILL GO UP AGAINST IT BY LOT AND WE WILL TAKE TEN MEN OF A HUNDRED THROUGHOUT ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL AND A HUNDRED OF A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND OF TEN THOUSAND TO BRING PROVISIONS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY COME THEY MAY REPAY GIBEAH OF BENJAMIN FOR ALL THE OUTRAGE THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED IN ISRAEL

 SO ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL GATHERED AGAINST THE CITY UNITED AS ONE MAN

AND THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL SENT MEN THROUGH ALL THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN SAYING WHAT EVIL IS THIS THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AMONG YOU

NOW THEREFORE GIVE UP THE MEN THE WORTHLESS FELLOWS IN GIBEAH THAT WE MAY PUT THEM TO DEATH AND PURGE EVIL FROM ISRAEL

 BUT THE BENJAMINITES WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THEIR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEN THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN CAME TOGETHER OUT OF THE CITIES TO GIBEAH TO GO OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN MUSTERED OUT OF THEIR CITIES ON THAT DAY  MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD BESIDES THE INHABITANTS OF GIBEAH WHO MUSTERED  CHOSEN MEN

AMONG ALL THESE WERE  CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LEFTHANDED; EVERY ONE COULD SLING A STONE AT A HAIR AND NOT MISS

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL APART FROM BENJAMIN MUSTERED  MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD; ALL THESE WERE MEN OF WAR

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AROSE AND WENT UP TO BETHEL AND INQUIRED OF GOD WHO SHALL GO UP FIRST FOR US TO FIGHT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN

 AND THE LORD SAID JUDAH SHALL GO UP FIRST

 THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ROSE IN THE MORNING AND ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBEAH

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WENT OUT TO FIGHT AGAINST BENJAMIN AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL DREW UP THE BATTLE LINE AGAINST THEM AT GIBEAH

THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN CAME OUT OF GIBEAH AND DESTROYED ON THAT DAY  MEN OF THE ISRAELITES

BUT THE PEOPLE THE MEN OF ISRAEL TOOK COURAGE AND AGAIN FORMED THE BATTLE LINE IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THEY HAD FORMED IT ON THE FIRST DAY

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT UP AND WEPT BEFORE THE LORD UNTIL THE EVENING

AND THEY INQUIRED OF THE LORD SHALL WE AGAIN DRAW NEAR TO FIGHT AGAINST OUR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN

 AND THE LORD SAID GO UP AGAINST THEM

 SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME NEAR AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN THE SECOND DAY

AND BENJAMIN WENT AGAINST THEM OUT OF GIBEAH THE SECOND DAY AND DESTROYED  MEN OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

ALL THESE WERE MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE WHOLE ARMY WENT UP AND CAME TO BETHEL AND WEPT

THEY SAT THERE BEFORE THE LORD AND FASTED THAT DAY UNTIL EVENING AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS BEFORE THE LORD

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL INQUIRED OF THE LORD FOR THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF GOD WAS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR SON OF AARON MINISTERED BEFORE IT IN THOSE DAYS SAYING SHALL WE GO OUT ONCE MORE TO BATTLE AGAINST OUR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN OR SHALL WE CEASE

 AND THE LORD SAID GO UP FOR TOMORROW I WILL GIVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND

 SO ISRAEL SET MEN IN AMBUSH AROUND GIBEAH

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT UP AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN ON THE THIRD DAY AND SET THEMSELVES IN ARRAY AGAINST GIBEAH AS AT OTHER TIMES

AND THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN WENT OUT AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND WERE DRAWN AWAY FROM THE CITY

AND AS AT OTHER TIMES THEY BEGAN TO STRIKE AND KILL SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE HIGHWAYS ONE OF WHICH GOES UP TO BETHEL AND THE OTHER TO GIBEAH AND IN THE OPEN COUNTRY ABOUT THIRTY MEN OF ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN SAID THEY ARE ROUTED BEFORE US AS AT THE FIRST

 BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID LET US FLEE AND DRAW THEM AWAY FROM THE CITY TO THE HIGHWAYS

 AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL ROSE UP OUT OF THEIR PLACE AND SET THEMSELVES IN ARRAY AT BAALTAMAR AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WHO WERE IN AMBUSH RUSHED OUT OF THEIR PLACE FROM MAAREHGEBA

AND THERE CAME AGAINST GIBEAH  CHOSEN MEN OUT OF ALL ISRAEL AND THE BATTLE WAS HARD BUT THE BENJAMINITES DID NOT KNOW THAT DISASTER WAS CLOSE UPON THEM

AND THE LORD DEFEATED BENJAMIN BEFORE ISRAEL AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DESTROYED  MEN OF BENJAMIN THAT DAY

ALL THESE WERE MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD

SO THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN SAW THAT THEY WERE DEFEATED

THE MEN OF ISRAEL GAVE GROUND TO BENJAMIN BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED THE MEN IN AMBUSH WHOM THEY HAD SET AGAINST GIBEAH

THEN THE MEN IN AMBUSH HURRIED AND RUSHED AGAINST GIBEAH; THE MEN IN AMBUSH MOVED OUT AND STRUCK ALL THE CITY WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

NOW THE APPOINTED SIGNAL BETWEEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL AND THE MEN IN THE MAIN AMBUSH WAS THAT WHEN THEY MADE A GREAT CLOUD OF SMOKE RISE UP OUT OF THE CITY THE MEN OF ISRAEL SHOULD TURN IN BATTLE

NOW BENJAMIN HAD BEGUN TO STRIKE AND KILL ABOUT THIRTY MEN OF ISRAEL

THEY SAID SURELY THEY ARE DEFEATED BEFORE US AS IN THE FIRST BATTLE

 BUT WHEN THE SIGNAL BEGAN TO RISE OUT OF THE CITY IN A COLUMN OF SMOKE THE BENJAMINITES LOOKED BEHIND THEM AND BEHOLD THE WHOLE OF THE CITY WENT UP IN SMOKE TO HEAVEN

THEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL TURNED AND THE MEN OF BENJAMIN WERE DISMAYED FOR THEY SAW THAT DISASTER WAS CLOSE UPON THEM

THEREFORE THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS BEFORE THE MEN OF ISRAEL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WILDERNESS BUT THE BATTLE OVERTOOK THEM

AND THOSE WHO CAME OUT OF THE CITIES WERE DESTROYING THEM IN THEIR MIDST

SURROUNDING THE BENJAMINITES THEY PURSUED THEM AND TROD THEM DOWN FROM NOHAH AS FAR AS OPPOSITE GIBEAH ON THE EAST

EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MEN OF BENJAMIN FELL ALL OF THEM MEN OF VALOR

AND THEY TURNED AND FLED TOWARD THE WILDERNESS TO THE ROCK OF RIMMON

FIVE THOUSAND MEN OF THEM WERE CUT DOWN IN THE HIGHWAYS

AND THEY WERE PURSUED HARD TO GIDOM AND  MEN OF THEM WERE STRUCK DOWN

SO ALL WHO FELL THAT DAY OF BENJAMIN WERE  MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD ALL OF THEM MEN OF VALOR

BUT  MEN TURNED AND FLED TOWARD THE WILDERNESS TO THE ROCK OF RIMMON AND REMAINED AT THE ROCK OF RIMMON FOUR MONTHS

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL TURNED BACK AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN AND STRUCK THEM WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD THE CITY MEN AND BEASTS AND ALL THAT THEY FOUND

AND ALL THE TOWNS THAT THEY FOUND THEY SET ON FIRE

NOW THE MEN OF ISRAEL HAD SWORN AT MIZPAH NO ONE OF US SHALL GIVE HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE TO BENJAMIN

 AND THE PEOPLE CAME TO BETHEL AND SAT THERE TILL EVENING BEFORE GOD AND THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND WEPT BITTERLY

AND THEY SAID O LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHY HAS THIS HAPPENED IN ISRAEL THAT TODAY THERE SHOULD BE ONE TRIBE LACKING IN ISRAEL

 AND THE NEXT DAY THE PEOPLE ROSE EARLY AND BUILT THERE AN ALTAR AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID WHICH OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL DID NOT COME UP IN THE ASSEMBLY TO THE LORD

 FOR THEY HAD TAKEN A GREAT OATH CONCERNING HIM WHO DID NOT COME UP TO THE LORD TO MIZPAH SAYING HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH

 AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD COMPASSION FOR BENJAMIN THEIR BROTHER AND SAID ONE TRIBE IS CUT OFF FROM ISRAEL THIS DAY

WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR WIVES FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT SINCE WE HAVE SWORN BY THE LORD THAT WE WILL NOT GIVE THEM ANY OF OUR DAUGHTERS FOR WIVES

 AND THEY SAID WHAT ONE IS THERE OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL THAT DID NOT COME UP TO THE LORD TO MIZPAH

 AND BEHOLD NO ONE HAD COME TO THE CAMP FROM JABESHGILEAD TO THE ASSEMBLY

FOR WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE MUSTERED BEHOLD NOT ONE OF THE INHABITANTS OF JABESHGILEAD WAS THERE

SO THE CONGREGATION SENT  OF THEIR BRAVEST MEN THERE AND COMMANDED THEM GO AND STRIKE THE INHABITANTS OF JABESHGILEAD WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD; ALSO THE WOMEN AND THE LITTLE ONES

THIS IS WHAT YOU SHALL DO EVERY MALE AND EVERY WOMAN THAT HAS LAIN WITH A MALE YOU SHALL DEVOTE TO DESTRUCTION

 AND THEY FOUND AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF JABESHGILEAD  YOUNG VIRGINS WHO HAD NOT KNOWN A MAN BY LYING WITH HIM AND THEY BROUGHT THEM TO THE CAMP AT SHILOH WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

THEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION SENT WORD TO THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN WHO WERE AT THE ROCK OF RIMMON AND PROCLAIMED PEACE TO THEM

AND BENJAMIN RETURNED AT THAT TIME

AND THEY GAVE THEM THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD SAVED ALIVE OF THE WOMEN OF JABESHGILEAD BUT THEY WERE NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM

AND THE PEOPLE HAD COMPASSION ON BENJAMIN BECAUSE THE LORD HAD MADE A BREACH IN THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

THEN THE ELDERS OF THE CONGREGATION SAID WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR WIVES FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT SINCE THE WOMEN ARE DESTROYED OUT OF BENJAMIN

 AND THEY SAID THERE MUST BE AN INHERITANCE FOR THE SURVIVORS OF BENJAMIN THAT A TRIBE NOT BE BLOTTED OUT FROM ISRAEL

YET WE CANNOT GIVE THEM WIVES FROM OUR DAUGHTERS

 FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD SWORN CURSED BE HE WHO GIVES A WIFE TO BENJAMIN

 SO THEY SAID BEHOLD THERE IS THE YEARLY FEAST OF THE LORD AT SHILOH WHICH IS NORTH OF BETHEL ON THE EAST OF THE HIGHWAY THAT GOES UP FROM BETHEL TO SHECHEM AND SOUTH OF LEBONAH

 AND THEY COMMANDED THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN SAYING GO AND LIE IN AMBUSH IN THE VINEYARDS AND WATCH

IF THE DAUGHTERS OF SHILOH COME OUT TO DANCE IN THE DANCES THEN COME OUT OF THE VINEYARDS AND SNATCH EACH MAN HIS WIFE FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF SHILOH AND GO TO THE LAND OF BENJAMIN

AND WHEN THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR BROTHERS COME TO COMPLAIN TO US WE WILL SAY TO THEM 'GRANT THEM GRACIOUSLY TO US BECAUSE WE DID NOT TAKE FOR EACH MAN OF THEM HIS WIFE IN BATTLE NEITHER DID YOU GIVE THEM TO THEM ELSE YOU WOULD NOW BE GUILTY

' AND THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN DID SO AND TOOK THEIR WIVES ACCORDING TO THEIR NUMBER FROM THE DANCERS WHOM THEY CARRIED OFF

THEN THEY WENT AND RETURNED TO THEIR INHERITANCE AND REBUILT THE TOWNS AND LIVED IN THEM

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEPARTED FROM THERE AT THAT TIME EVERY MAN TO HIS TRIBE AND FAMILY AND THEY WENT OUT FROM THERE EVERY MAN TO HIS INHERITANCE

IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO KING IN ISRAEL

EVERYONE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES

MICAHTHE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO MICAH OF MORESHETH IN THE DAYS OF JOTHAM AHAZ AND HEZEKIAH KINGS OF JUDAH WHICH HE SAW CONCERNING SAMARIA AND JERUSALEM

HEAR YOU PEOPLES ALL OF YOU; PAY ATTENTION O EARTH AND ALL THAT IS IN IT AND LET THE LORD GOD BE A WITNESS AGAINST YOU THE LORD FROM HIS HOLY TEMPLE

FOR BEHOLD THE LORD IS COMING OUT OF HIS PLACE AND WILL COME DOWN AND TREAD UPON THE HIGH PLACES OF THE EARTH

AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL MELT UNDER HIM AND THE VALLEYS WILL SPLIT OPEN LIKE WAX BEFORE THE FIRE LIKE WATERS POURED DOWN A STEEP PLACE

ALL THIS IS FOR THE TRANSGRESSION OF JACOB AND FOR THE SINS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

WHAT IS THE TRANSGRESSION OF JACOB

IS IT NOT SAMARIA

AND WHAT IS THE HIGH PLACE OF JUDAH

IS IT NOT JERUSALEM

THEREFORE I WILL MAKE SAMARIA A HEAP IN THE OPEN COUNTRY A PLACE FOR PLANTING VINEYARDS AND I WILL POUR DOWN HER STONES INTO THE VALLEY AND UNCOVER HER FOUNDATIONS

ALL HER CARVED IMAGES SHALL BE BEATEN TO PIECES ALL HER WAGES SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE AND ALL HER IDOLS I WILL LAY WASTE FOR FROM THE FEE OF A PROSTITUTE SHE GATHERED THEM AND TO THE FEE OF A PROSTITUTE THEY SHALL RETURN

FOR THIS I WILL LAMENT AND WAIL; I WILL GO STRIPPED AND NAKED; I WILL MAKE LAMENTATION LIKE THE JACKALS AND MOURNING LIKE THE OSTRICHES

FOR HER WOUND IS INCURABLE AND IT HAS COME TO JUDAH; IT HAS REACHED TO THE GATE OF MY PEOPLE TO JERUSALEM

TELL IT NOT IN GATH; WEEP NOT AT ALL; IN BETHLEAPHRAH ROLL YOURSELVES IN THE DUST

PASS ON YOUR WAY INHABITANTS OF SHAPHIR IN NAKEDNESS AND SHAME; THE INHABITANTS OF ZAANAN DO NOT COME OUT; THE LAMENTATION OF BETHEZEL SHALL TAKE AWAY FROM YOU ITS STANDING PLACE

FOR THE INHABITANTS OF MAROTH WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR GOOD BECAUSE DISASTER HAS COME DOWN FROM THE LORD TO THE GATE OF JERUSALEM

HARNESS THE STEEDS TO THE CHARIOTS INHABITANTS OF LACHISH; IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF SIN TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION FOR IN YOU WERE FOUND THE TRANSGRESSIONS OF ISRAEL

THEREFORE YOU SHALL GIVE PARTING GIFTS TO MORESHETHGATH; THE HOUSES OF ACHZIB SHALL BE A DECEITFUL THING TO THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

I WILL AGAIN BRING A CONQUEROR TO YOU INHABITANTS OF MARESHAH; THE GLORY OF ISRAEL SHALL COME TO ADULLAM

MAKE YOURSELVES BALD AND CUT OFF YOUR HAIR FOR THE CHILDREN OF YOUR DELIGHT; MAKE YOURSELVES AS BALD AS THE EAGLE FOR THEY SHALL GO FROM YOU INTO EXILE

WOE TO THOSE WHO DEVISE WICKEDNESS AND WORK EVIL ON THEIR BEDS

WHEN THE MORNING DAWNS THEY PERFORM IT BECAUSE IT IS IN THE POWER OF THEIR HAND

THEY COVET FIELDS AND SEIZE THEM AND HOUSES AND TAKE THEM AWAY; THEY OPPRESS A MAN AND HIS HOUSE A MAN AND HIS INHERITANCE

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD AGAINST THIS FAMILY I AM DEVISING DISASTER FROM WHICH YOU CANNOT REMOVE YOUR NECKS AND YOU SHALL NOT WALK HAUGHTILY FOR IT WILL BE A TIME OF DISASTER

IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL TAKE UP A TAUNT SONG AGAINST YOU AND MOAN BITTERLY AND SAY WE ARE UTTERLY RUINED; HE CHANGES THE PORTION OF MY PEOPLE; HOW HE REMOVES IT FROM ME

TO AN APOSTATE HE ALLOTS OUR FIELDS

 THEREFORE YOU WILL HAVE NONE TO CAST THE LINE BY LOT IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD

DO NOT PREACHTHUS THEY PREACHONE SHOULD NOT PREACH OF SUCH THINGS; DISGRACE WILL NOT OVERTAKE US

 SHOULD THIS BE SAID O HOUSE OF JACOB

HAS THE LORD GROWN IMPATIENT

ARE THESE HIS DEEDS

DO NOT MY WORDS DO GOOD TO HIM WHO WALKS UPRIGHTLY

BUT LATELY MY PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AS AN ENEMY; YOU STRIP THE RICH ROBE FROM THOSE WHO PASS BY TRUSTINGLY WITH NO THOUGHT OF WAR

THE WOMEN OF MY PEOPLE YOU DRIVE OUT FROM THEIR DELIGHTFUL HOUSES; FROM THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN YOU TAKE AWAY MY SPLENDOR FOREVER

ARISE AND GO FOR THIS IS NO PLACE TO REST BECAUSE OF UNCLEANNESS THAT DESTROYS WITH A GRIEVOUS DESTRUCTION

IF A MAN SHOULD GO ABOUT AND UTTER WIND AND LIES SAYING I WILL PREACH TO YOU OF WINE AND STRONG DRINK HE WOULD BE THE PREACHER FOR THIS PEOPLE

I WILL SURELY ASSEMBLE ALL OF YOU O JACOB; I WILL GATHER THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL; I WILL SET THEM TOGETHER LIKE SHEEP IN A FOLD LIKE A FLOCK IN ITS PASTURE A NOISY MULTITUDE OF MEN

HE WHO OPENS THE BREACH GOES UP BEFORE THEM; THEY BREAK THROUGH AND PASS THE GATE GOING OUT BY IT

THEIR KING PASSES ON BEFORE THEM THE LORD AT THEIR HEAD

AND I SAID HEAR YOU HEADS OF JACOB AND RULERS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

IS IT NOT FOR YOU TO KNOW JUSTICE

 YOU WHO HATE THE GOOD AND LOVE THE EVIL WHO TEAR THE SKIN FROM OFF MY PEOPLE AND THEIR FLESH FROM OFF THEIR BONES WHO EAT THE FLESH OF MY PEOPLE AND FLAY THEIR SKIN FROM OFF THEM AND BREAK THEIR BONES IN PIECES AND CHOP THEM UP LIKE MEAT IN A POT LIKE FLESH IN A CAULDRON

THEN THEY WILL CRY TO THE LORD BUT HE WILL NOT ANSWER THEM; HE WILL HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEM AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE THEIR DEEDS EVIL

THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE PROPHETS WHO LEAD MY PEOPLE ASTRAY WHO CRY PEACE WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT BUT DECLARE WAR AGAINST HIM WHO PUTS NOTHING INTO THEIR MOUTHS

THEREFORE IT SHALL BE NIGHT TO YOU WITHOUT VISION AND DARKNESS TO YOU WITHOUT DIVINATION

THE SUN SHALL GO DOWN ON THE PROPHETS AND THE DAY SHALL BE BLACK OVER THEM; THE SEERS SHALL BE DISGRACED AND THE DIVINERS PUT TO SHAME; THEY SHALL ALL COVER THEIR LIPS FOR THERE IS NO ANSWER FROM GOD

BUT AS FOR ME I AM FILLED WITH POWER WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD AND WITH JUSTICE AND MIGHT TO DECLARE TO JACOB HIS TRANSGRESSION AND TO ISRAEL HIS SIN

HEAR THIS YOU HEADS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB AND RULERS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WHO DETEST JUSTICE AND MAKE CROOKED ALL THAT IS STRAIGHT WHO BUILD ZION WITH BLOOD AND JERUSALEM WITH INIQUITY

ITS HEADS GIVE JUDGMENT FOR A BRIBE; ITS PRIESTS TEACH FOR A PRICE; ITS PROPHETS PRACTICE DIVINATION FOR MONEY; YET THEY LEAN ON THE LORD AND SAY IS NOT THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF US

NO DISASTER SHALL COME UPON US

 THEREFORE BECAUSE OF YOU ZION SHALL BE PLOWED AS A FIELD; JERUSALEM SHALL BECOME A HEAP OF RUINS AND THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE A WOODED HEIGHT

IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE LATTER DAYS THAT THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND IT SHALL BE LIFTED UP ABOVE THE HILLS; AND PEOPLES SHALL FLOW TO IT AND MANY NATIONS SHALL COME AND SAY COME LET US GO UP TO THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD TO THE HOUSE OF THE GOD OF JACOB THAT HE MAY TEACH US HIS WAYS AND THAT WE MAY WALK IN HIS PATHS

 FOR OUT OF ZION SHALL GO FORTH THE LAW AND THE WORD OF THE LORD FROM JERUSALEM

HE SHALL JUDGE BETWEEN MANY PEOPLES AND SHALL DECIDE FOR STRONG NATIONS AFAR OFF; AND THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND THEIR SPEARS INTO PRUNING HOOKS; NATION SHALL NOT LIFT UP SWORD AGAINST NATION NEITHER SHALL THEY LEARN WAR ANYMORE; BUT THEY SHALL SIT EVERY MAN UNDER HIS VINE AND UNDER HIS FIG TREE AND NO ONE SHALL MAKE THEM AFRAID FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SPOKEN

FOR ALL THE PEOPLES WALK EACH IN THE NAME OF ITS GOD BUT WE WILL WALK IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OUR GOD FOREVER AND EVER

IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD I WILL ASSEMBLE THE LAME AND GATHER THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AWAY AND THOSE WHOM I HAVE AFFLICTED; AND THE LAME I WILL MAKE THE REMNANT AND THOSE WHO WERE CAST OFF A STRONG NATION; AND THE LORD WILL REIGN OVER THEM IN MOUNT ZION FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

AND YOU O TOWER OF THE FLOCK HILL OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION TO YOU SHALL IT COME THE FORMER DOMINION SHALL COME KINGSHIP FOR THE DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

NOW WHY DO YOU CRY ALOUD

IS THERE NO KING IN YOU

HAS YOUR COUNSELOR PERISHED THAT PAIN SEIZED YOU LIKE A WOMAN IN LABOR

WRITHE AND GROAN O DAUGHTER OF ZION LIKE A WOMAN IN LABOR FOR NOW YOU SHALL GO OUT FROM THE CITY AND DWELL IN THE OPEN COUNTRY; YOU SHALL GO TO BABYLON

THERE YOU SHALL BE RESCUED; THERE THE LORD WILL REDEEM YOU FROM THE HAND OF YOUR ENEMIES

NOW MANY NATIONS ARE ASSEMBLED AGAINST YOU SAYING LET HER BE DEFILED AND LET OUR EYES GAZE UPON ZION

 BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW THE THOUGHTS OF THE LORD; THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PLAN THAT HE HAS GATHERED THEM AS SHEAVES TO THE THRESHING FLOOR

ARISE AND THRESH O DAUGHTER OF ZION FOR I WILL MAKE YOUR HORN IRON AND I WILL MAKE YOUR HOOFS BRONZE; YOU SHALL BEAT IN PIECES MANY PEOPLES; AND SHALL DEVOTE THEIR GAIN TO THE LORD THEIR WEALTH TO THE LORD OF THE WHOLE EARTH

NOW MUSTER YOUR TROOPS O DAUGHTER OF TROOPS; SIEGE IS LAID AGAINST US; WITH A ROD THEY STRIKE THE JUDGE OF ISRAEL ON THE CHEEK

BUT YOU O BETHLEHEM EPHRATHAH WHO ARE TOO LITTLE TO BE AMONG THE CLANS OF JUDAH FROM YOU SHALL COME FORTH FOR ME ONE WHO IS TO BE RULER IN ISRAEL WHOSE ORIGIN IS FROM OF OLD FROM ANCIENT DAYS

THEREFORE HE SHALL GIVE THEM UP UNTIL THE TIME WHEN SHE WHO IS IN LABOR HAS GIVEN BIRTH; THEN THE REST OF HIS BROTHERS SHALL RETURN TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND HE SHALL STAND AND SHEPHERD HIS FLOCK IN THE STRENGTH OF THE LORD IN THE MAJESTY OF THE NAME OF THE LORD HIS GOD

AND THEY SHALL DWELL SECURE FOR NOW HE SHALL BE GREAT TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

AND HE SHALL BE THEIR PEACE

WHEN THE ASSYRIAN COMES INTO OUR LAND AND TREADS IN OUR PALACES THEN WE WILL RAISE AGAINST HIM SEVEN SHEPHERDS AND EIGHT PRINCES OF MEN; THEY SHALL SHEPHERD THE LAND OF ASSYRIA WITH THE SWORD AND THE LAND OF NIMROD AT ITS ENTRANCES; AND HE SHALL DELIVER US FROM THE ASSYRIAN WHEN HE COMES INTO OUR LAND AND TREADS WITHIN OUR BORDER

THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES LIKE DEW FROM THE LORD LIKE SHOWERS ON THE GRASS WHICH DELAY NOT FOR A MAN NOR WAIT FOR THE CHILDREN OF MAN

AND THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE AMONG THE NATIONS IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES LIKE A LION AMONG THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST LIKE A YOUNG LION AMONG THE FLOCKS OF SHEEP WHICH WHEN IT GOES THROUGH TREADS DOWN AND TEARS IN PIECES AND THERE IS NONE TO DELIVER

YOUR HAND SHALL BE LIFTED UP OVER YOUR ADVERSARIES AND ALL YOUR ENEMIES SHALL BE CUT OFF

AND IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD I WILL CUT OFF YOUR HORSES FROM AMONG YOU AND WILL DESTROY YOUR CHARIOTS; AND I WILL CUT OFF THE CITIES OF YOUR LAND AND THROW DOWN ALL YOUR STRONGHOLDS; AND I WILL CUT OFF SORCERIES FROM YOUR HAND AND YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE TELLERS OF FORTUNES; AND I WILL CUT OFF YOUR CARVED IMAGES AND YOUR PILLARS FROM AMONG YOU AND YOU SHALL BOW DOWN NO MORE TO THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS; AND I WILL ROOT OUT YOUR ASHERAH IMAGES FROM AMONG YOU AND DESTROY YOUR CITIES

AND IN ANGER AND WRATH I WILL EXECUTE VENGEANCE ON THE NATIONS THAT DID NOT OBEY

HEAR WHAT THE LORD SAYS ARISE PLEAD YOUR CASE BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS AND LET THE HILLS HEAR YOUR VOICE

HEAR YOU MOUNTAINS THE INDICTMENT OF THE LORD AND YOU ENDURING FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH FOR THE LORD HAS AN INDICTMENT AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AND HE WILL CONTEND WITH ISRAEL

O MY PEOPLE WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU

HOW HAVE I WEARIED YOU

ANSWER ME

FOR I BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT AND REDEEMED YOU FROM THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY AND I SENT BEFORE YOU MOSES AARON AND MIRIAM

O MY PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT BALAK KING OF MOAB DEVISED AND WHAT BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR ANSWERED HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED FROM SHITTIM TO GILGAL THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE SAVING ACTS OF THE LORD

 WITH WHAT SHALL I COME BEFORE THE LORD AND BOW MYSELF BEFORE GOD ON HIGH

SHALL I COME BEFORE HIM WITH BURNT OFFERINGS WITH CALVES A YEAR OLD

WILL THE LORD BE PLEASED WITH THOUSANDS OF RAMS WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF RIVERS OF OIL

SHALL I GIVE MY FIRSTBORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION THE FRUIT OF MY BODY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL

 HE HAS TOLD YOU O MAN WHAT IS GOOD; AND WHAT DOES THE LORD REQUIRE OF YOU BUT TO DO JUSTICE AND TO LOVE KINDNESS AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH YOUR GOD

THE VOICE OF THE LORD CRIES TO THE CITYAND IT IS SOUND WISDOM TO FEAR YOUR NAME HEAR OF THE ROD AND OF HIM WHO APPOINTED IT

CAN I FORGET ANY LONGER THE TREASURES OF WICKEDNESS IN THE HOUSE OF THE WICKED AND THE SCANT MEASURE THAT IS ACCURSED

SHALL I ACQUIT THE MAN WITH WICKED SCALES AND WITH A BAG OF DECEITFUL WEIGHTS

YOUR RICH MEN ARE FULL OF VIOLENCE; YOUR INHABITANTS SPEAK LIES AND THEIR TONGUE IS DECEITFUL IN THEIR MOUTH

THEREFORE I STRIKE YOU WITH A GRIEVOUS BLOW MAKING YOU DESOLATE BECAUSE OF YOUR SINS

YOU SHALL EAT BUT NOT BE SATISFIED AND THERE SHALL BE HUNGER WITHIN YOU; YOU SHALL PUT AWAY BUT NOT PRESERVE AND WHAT YOU PRESERVE I WILL GIVE TO THE SWORD

YOU SHALL SOW BUT NOT REAP; YOU SHALL TREAD OLIVES BUT NOT ANOINT YOURSELVES WITH OIL; YOU SHALL TREAD GRAPES BUT NOT DRINK WINE

FOR YOU HAVE KEPT THE STATUTES OF OMRI AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB; AND YOU HAVE WALKED IN THEIR COUNSELS THAT I MAY MAKE YOU A DESOLATION AND YOUR INHABITANTS A HISSING; SO YOU SHALL BEAR THE SCORN OF MY PEOPLE

WOE IS ME

FOR I HAVE BECOME AS WHEN THE SUMMER FRUIT HAS BEEN GATHERED AS WHEN THE GRAPES HAVE BEEN GLEANED THERE IS NO CLUSTER TO EAT NO FIRSTRIPE FIG THAT MY SOUL DESIRES

THE GODLY HAS PERISHED FROM THE EARTH AND THERE IS NO ONE UPRIGHT AMONG MANKIND; THEY ALL LIE IN WAIT FOR BLOOD AND EACH HUNTS THE OTHER WITH A NET

THEIR HANDS ARE ON WHAT IS EVIL TO DO IT WELL; THE PRINCE AND THE JUDGE ASK FOR A BRIBE AND THE GREAT MAN UTTERS THE EVIL DESIRE OF HIS SOUL; THUS THEY WEAVE IT TOGETHER

THE BEST OF THEM IS LIKE A BRIER THE MOST UPRIGHT OF THEM A THORN HEDGE

THE DAY OF YOUR WATCHMEN OF YOUR PUNISHMENT HAS COME; NOW THEIR CONFUSION IS AT HAND

PUT NO TRUST IN A NEIGHBOR; HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN A FRIEND; GUARD THE DOORS OF YOUR MOUTH FROM HER WHO LIES IN YOUR ARMS; FOR THE SON TREATS THE FATHER WITH CONTEMPT THE DAUGHTER RISES UP AGAINST HER MOTHER THE DAUGHTERINLAW AGAINST HER MOTHERINLAW; A MAN'S ENEMIES ARE THE MEN OF HIS OWN HOUSE

BUT AS FOR ME I WILL LOOK TO THE LORD; I WILL WAIT FOR THE GOD OF MY SALVATION; MY GOD WILL HEAR ME

REJOICE NOT OVER ME O MY ENEMY; WHEN I FALL I SHALL RISE; WHEN I SIT IN DARKNESS THE LORD WILL BE A LIGHT TO ME

I WILL BEAR THE INDIGNATION OF THE LORD BECAUSE I HAVE SINNED AGAINST HIM UNTIL HE PLEADS MY CAUSE AND EXECUTES JUDGMENT FOR ME

HE WILL BRING ME OUT TO THE LIGHT; I SHALL LOOK UPON HIS VINDICATION

THEN MY ENEMY WILL SEE AND SHAME WILL COVER HER WHO SAID TO ME WHERE IS THE LORD YOUR GOD

 MY EYES WILL LOOK UPON HER; NOW SHE WILL BE TRAMPLED DOWN LIKE THE MIRE OF THE STREETS

A DAY FOR THE BUILDING OF YOUR WALLS

IN THAT DAY THE BOUNDARY SHALL BE FAR EXTENDED

IN THAT DAY THEY WILL COME TO YOU FROM ASSYRIA AND THE CITIES OF EGYPT AND FROM EGYPT TO THE RIVER FROM SEA TO SEA AND FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN

BUT THE EARTH WILL BE DESOLATE BECAUSE OF ITS INHABITANTS FOR THE FRUIT OF THEIR DEEDS

SHEPHERD YOUR PEOPLE WITH YOUR STAFF THE FLOCK OF YOUR INHERITANCE WHO DWELL ALONE IN A FOREST IN THE MIDST OF A GARDEN LAND; LET THEM GRAZE IN BASHAN AND GILEAD AS IN THE DAYS OF OLD

AS IN THE DAYS WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT I WILL SHOW THEM MARVELOUS THINGS

THE NATIONS SHALL SEE AND BE ASHAMED OF ALL THEIR MIGHT; THEY SHALL LAY THEIR HANDS ON THEIR MOUTHS; THEIR EARS SHALL BE DEAF; THEY SHALL LICK THE DUST LIKE A SERPENT LIKE THE CRAWLING THINGS OF THE EARTH; THEY SHALL COME TREMBLING OUT OF THEIR STRONGHOLDS; THEY SHALL TURN IN DREAD TO THE LORD OUR GOD AND THEY SHALL BE IN FEAR OF YOU

WHO IS A GOD LIKE YOU PARDONING INIQUITY AND PASSING OVER TRANSGRESSION FOR THE REMNANT OF HIS INHERITANCE

HE DOES NOT RETAIN HIS ANGER FOREVER BECAUSE HE DELIGHTS IN STEADFAST LOVE

HE WILL AGAIN HAVE COMPASSION ON US; HE WILL TREAD OUR INIQUITIES UNDER FOOT

YOU WILL CAST ALL OUR SINS INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA

YOU WILL SHOW FAITHFULNESS TO JACOB AND STEADFAST LOVE TO ABRAHAM AS YOU HAVE SWORN TO OUR FATHERS FROM THE DAYS OF OLD

PROVERBSTHE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON SON OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL TO KNOW WISDOM AND INSTRUCTION TO UNDERSTAND WORDS OF INSIGHT TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION IN WISE DEALING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS JUSTICE AND EQUITY; TO GIVE PRUDENCE TO THE SIMPLE KNOWLEDGE AND DISCRETION TO THE YOUTH LET THE WISE HEAR AND INCREASE IN LEARNING AND THE ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS OBTAIN GUIDANCE TO UNDERSTAND A PROVERB AND A SAYING THE WORDS OF THE WISE AND THEIR RIDDLES

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF KNOWLEDGE; FOOLS DESPISE WISDOM AND INSTRUCTION

HEAR MY SON YOUR FATHER'S INSTRUCTION AND FORSAKE NOT YOUR MOTHER'S TEACHING FOR THEY ARE A GRACEFUL GARLAND FOR YOUR HEAD AND PENDANTS FOR YOUR NECK

MY SON IF SINNERS ENTICE YOU DO NOT CONSENT

IF THEY SAY COME WITH US LET US LIE IN WAIT FOR BLOOD; LET US AMBUSH THE INNOCENT WITHOUT REASON; LIKE SHEOL LET US SWALLOW THEM ALIVE AND WHOLE LIKE THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT; WE SHALL FIND ALL PRECIOUS GOODS WE SHALL FILL OUR HOUSES WITH PLUNDER; THROW IN YOUR LOT AMONG US; WE WILL ALL HAVE ONE PURSE MY SON DO NOT WALK IN THE WAY WITH THEM; HOLD BACK YOUR FOOT FROM THEIR PATHS FOR THEIR FEET RUN TO EVIL AND THEY MAKE HASTE TO SHED BLOOD

FOR IN VAIN IS A NET SPREAD IN THE SIGHT OF ANY BIRD BUT THESE MEN LIE IN WAIT FOR THEIR OWN BLOOD; THEY SET AN AMBUSH FOR THEIR OWN LIVES

SUCH ARE THE WAYS OF EVERYONE WHO IS GREEDY FOR UNJUST GAIN; IT TAKES AWAY THE LIFE OF ITS POSSESSORS

WISDOM CRIES ALOUD IN THE STREET IN THE MARKETS SHE RAISES HER VOICE; AT THE HEAD OF THE NOISY STREETS SHE CRIES OUT; AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITY GATES SHE SPEAKS HOW LONG O SIMPLE ONES WILL YOU LOVE BEING SIMPLE

HOW LONG WILL SCOFFERS DELIGHT IN THEIR SCOFFING AND FOOLS HATE KNOWLEDGE

IF YOU TURN AT MY REPROOF BEHOLD I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT TO YOU; I WILL MAKE MY WORDS KNOWN TO YOU

BECAUSE I HAVE CALLED AND YOU REFUSED TO LISTEN HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HAND AND NO ONE HAS HEEDED BECAUSE YOU HAVE IGNORED ALL MY COUNSEL AND WOULD HAVE NONE OF MY REPROOF I ALSO WILL LAUGH AT YOUR CALAMITY; I WILL MOCK WHEN TERROR STRIKES YOU WHEN TERROR STRIKES YOU LIKE A STORM AND YOUR CALAMITY COMES LIKE A WHIRLWIND WHEN DISTRESS AND ANGUISH COME UPON YOU

THEN THEY WILL CALL UPON ME BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER; THEY WILL SEEK ME DILIGENTLY BUT WILL NOT FIND ME

BECAUSE THEY HATED KNOWLEDGE AND DID NOT CHOOSE THE FEAR OF THE LORD WOULD HAVE NONE OF MY COUNSEL AND DESPISED ALL MY REPROOF THEREFORE THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WAY AND HAVE THEIR FILL OF THEIR OWN DEVICES

FOR THE SIMPLE ARE KILLED BY THEIR TURNING AWAY AND THE COMPLACENCY OF FOOLS DESTROYS THEM; BUT WHOEVER LISTENS TO ME WILL DWELL SECURE AND WILL BE AT EASE WITHOUT DREAD OF DISASTER

MY SON IF YOU RECEIVE MY WORDS AND TREASURE UP MY COMMANDMENTS WITH YOU MAKING YOUR EAR ATTENTIVE TO WISDOM AND INCLINING YOUR HEART TO UNDERSTANDING; YES IF YOU CALL OUT FOR INSIGHT AND RAISE YOUR VOICE FOR UNDERSTANDING IF YOU SEEK IT LIKE SILVER AND SEARCH FOR IT AS FOR HIDDEN TREASURES THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE FEAR OF THE LORD AND FIND THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

FOR THE LORD GIVES WISDOM; FROM HIS MOUTH COME KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING; HE STORES UP SOUND WISDOM FOR THE UPRIGHT; HE IS A SHIELD TO THOSE WHO WALK IN INTEGRITY GUARDING THE PATHS OF JUSTICE AND WATCHING OVER THE WAY OF HIS SAINTS

THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE AND EQUITY EVERY GOOD PATH; FOR WISDOM WILL COME INTO YOUR HEART AND KNOWLEDGE WILL BE PLEASANT TO YOUR SOUL; DISCRETION WILL WATCH OVER YOU UNDERSTANDING WILL GUARD YOU DELIVERING YOU FROM THE WAY OF EVIL FROM MEN OF PERVERTED SPEECH WHO FORSAKE THE PATHS OF UPRIGHTNESS TO WALK IN THE WAYS OF DARKNESS WHO REJOICE IN DOING EVIL AND DELIGHT IN THE PERVERSENESS OF EVIL MEN WHOSE PATHS ARE CROOKED AND WHO ARE DEVIOUS IN THEIR WAYS

SO YOU WILL BE DELIVERED FROM THE FORBIDDEN WOMAN FROM THE ADULTERESS WITH HER SMOOTH WORDS WHO FORSAKES THE COMPANION OF HER YOUTH AND FORGETS THE COVENANT OF HER GOD; FOR HER HOUSE SINKS DOWN TO DEATH AND HER PATHS TO THE DEPARTED; NONE WHO GO TO HER COME BACK NOR DO THEY REGAIN THE PATHS OF LIFE

SO YOU WILL WALK IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD AND KEEP TO THE PATHS OF THE RIGHTEOUS

FOR THE UPRIGHT WILL INHABIT THE LAND AND THOSE WITH INTEGRITY WILL REMAIN IN IT BUT THE WICKED WILL BE CUT OFF FROM THE LAND AND THE TREACHEROUS WILL BE ROOTED OUT OF IT

MY SON DO NOT FORGET MY TEACHING BUT LET YOUR HEART KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS FOR LENGTH OF DAYS AND YEARS OF LIFE AND PEACE THEY WILL ADD TO YOU

LET NOT STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS FORSAKE YOU; BIND THEM AROUND YOUR NECK; WRITE THEM ON THE TABLET OF YOUR HEART

SO YOU WILL FIND FAVOR AND GOOD SUCCESS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN

TRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND DO NOT LEAN ON YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING

IN ALL YOUR WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AND HE WILL MAKE STRAIGHT YOUR PATHS

BE NOT WISE IN YOUR OWN EYES; FEAR THE LORD AND TURN AWAY FROM EVIL

IT WILL BE HEALING TO YOUR FLESH AND REFRESHMENT TO YOUR BONES

HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR WEALTH AND WITH THE FIRSTFRUITS OF ALL YOUR PRODUCE; THEN YOUR BARNS WILL BE FILLED WITH PLENTY AND YOUR VATS WILL BE BURSTING WITH WINE

MY SON DO NOT DESPISE THE LORD'S DISCIPLINE OR BE WEARY OF HIS REPROOF FOR THE LORD REPROVES HIM WHOM HE LOVES AS A FATHER THE SON IN WHOM HE DELIGHTS

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO FINDS WISDOM AND THE ONE WHO GETS UNDERSTANDING FOR THE GAIN FROM HER IS BETTER THAN GAIN FROM SILVER AND HER PROFIT BETTER THAN GOLD

SHE IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN JEWELS AND NOTHING YOU DESIRE CAN COMPARE WITH HER

LONG LIFE IS IN HER RIGHT HAND; IN HER LEFT HAND ARE RICHES AND HONOR

HER WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE

SHE IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO LAY HOLD OF HER; THOSE WHO HOLD HER FAST ARE CALLED BLESSED

THE LORD BY WISDOM FOUNDED THE EARTH; BY UNDERSTANDING HE ESTABLISHED THE HEAVENS; BY HIS KNOWLEDGE THE DEEPS BROKE OPEN AND THE CLOUDS DROP DOWN THE DEW

MY SON DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THESEKEEP SOUND WISDOM AND DISCRETION AND THEY WILL BE LIFE FOR YOUR SOUL AND ADORNMENT FOR YOUR NECK

THEN YOU WILL WALK ON YOUR WAY SECURELY AND YOUR FOOT WILL NOT STUMBLE

IF YOU LIE DOWN YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID; WHEN YOU LIE DOWN YOUR SLEEP WILL BE SWEET

DO NOT BE AFRAID OF SUDDEN TERROR OR OF THE RUIN OF THE WICKED WHEN IT COMES FOR THE LORD WILL BE YOUR CONFIDENCE AND WILL KEEP YOUR FOOT FROM BEING CAUGHT

DO NOT WITHHOLD GOOD FROM THOSE TO WHOM IT IS DUE WHEN IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO DO IT

DO NOT SAY TO YOUR NEIGHBOR GO AND COME AGAIN TOMORROW I WILL GIVE ITWHEN YOU HAVE IT WITH YOU

DO NOT PLAN EVIL AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO DWELLS TRUSTINGLY BESIDE YOU

DO NOT CONTEND WITH A MAN FOR NO REASON WHEN HE HAS DONE YOU NO HARM

DO NOT ENVY A MAN OF VIOLENCE AND DO NOT CHOOSE ANY OF HIS WAYS FOR THE DEVIOUS PERSON IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT THE UPRIGHT ARE IN HIS CONFIDENCE

THE LORD'S CURSE IS ON THE HOUSE OF THE WICKED BUT HE BLESSES THE DWELLING OF THE RIGHTEOUS

TOWARD THE SCORNERS HE IS SCORNFUL BUT TO THE HUMBLE HE GIVES FAVOR

THE WISE WILL INHERIT HONOR BUT FOOLS GET DISGRACE

HEAR O SONS A FATHER'S INSTRUCTION AND BE ATTENTIVE THAT YOU MAY GAIN INSIGHT FOR I GIVE YOU GOOD PRECEPTS; DO NOT FORSAKE MY TEACHING

WHEN I WAS A SON WITH MY FATHER TENDER THE ONLY ONE IN THE SIGHT OF MY MOTHER HE TAUGHT ME AND SAID TO ME LET YOUR HEART HOLD FAST MY WORDS; KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE

GET WISDOM; GET INSIGHT; DO NOT FORGET AND DO NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

DO NOT FORSAKE HER AND SHE WILL KEEP YOU; LOVE HER AND SHE WILL GUARD YOU

THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS THIS GET WISDOM AND WHATEVER YOU GET GET INSIGHT

PRIZE HER HIGHLY AND SHE WILL EXALT YOU; SHE WILL HONOR YOU IF YOU EMBRACE HER

SHE WILL PLACE ON YOUR HEAD A GRACEFUL GARLAND; SHE WILL BESTOW ON YOU A BEAUTIFUL CROWN

 HEAR MY SON AND ACCEPT MY WORDS THAT THE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE MAY BE MANY

I HAVE TAUGHT YOU THE WAY OF WISDOM; I HAVE LED YOU IN THE PATHS OF UPRIGHTNESS

WHEN YOU WALK YOUR STEP WILL NOT BE HAMPERED AND IF YOU RUN YOU WILL NOT STUMBLE

KEEP HOLD OF INSTRUCTION; DO NOT LET GO; GUARD HER FOR SHE IS YOUR LIFE

DO NOT ENTER THE PATH OF THE WICKED AND DO NOT WALK IN THE WAY OF THE EVIL

AVOID IT; DO NOT GO ON IT; TURN AWAY FROM IT AND PASS ON

FOR THEY CANNOT SLEEP UNLESS THEY HAVE DONE WRONG; THEY ARE ROBBED OF SLEEP UNLESS THEY HAVE MADE SOMEONE STUMBLE

FOR THEY EAT THE BREAD OF WICKEDNESS AND DRINK THE WINE OF VIOLENCE

BUT THE PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS LIKE THE LIGHT OF DAWN WHICH SHINES BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTIL FULL DAY

THE WAY OF THE WICKED IS LIKE DEEP DARKNESS; THEY DO NOT KNOW OVER WHAT THEY STUMBLE

MY SON BE ATTENTIVE TO MY WORDS; INCLINE YOUR EAR TO MY SAYINGS

LET THEM NOT ESCAPE FROM YOUR SIGHT; KEEP THEM WITHIN YOUR HEART

FOR THEY ARE LIFE TO THOSE WHO FIND THEM AND HEALING TO ALL THEIR FLESH

KEEP YOUR HEART WITH ALL VIGILANCE FOR FROM IT FLOW THE SPRINGS OF LIFE

PUT AWAY FROM YOU CROOKED SPEECH AND PUT DEVIOUS TALK FAR FROM YOU

LET YOUR EYES LOOK DIRECTLY FORWARD AND YOUR GAZE BE STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU

PONDER THE PATH OF YOUR FEET; THEN ALL YOUR WAYS WILL BE SURE

DO NOT SWERVE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT; TURN YOUR FOOT AWAY FROM EVIL

MY SON BE ATTENTIVE TO MY WISDOM; INCLINE YOUR EAR TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MAY KEEP DISCRETION AND YOUR LIPS MAY GUARD KNOWLEDGE

FOR THE LIPS OF A FORBIDDEN WOMAN DRIP HONEY AND HER SPEECH IS SMOOTHER THAN OIL BUT IN THE END SHE IS BITTER AS WORMWOOD SHARP AS A TWOEDGED SWORD

HER FEET GO DOWN TO DEATH; HER STEPS FOLLOW THE PATH TO SHEOL; SHE DOES NOT PONDER THE PATH OF LIFE; HER WAYS WANDER AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT

AND NOW O SONS LISTEN TO ME AND DO NOT DEPART FROM THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

KEEP YOUR WAY FAR FROM HER AND DO NOT GO NEAR THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE LEST YOU GIVE YOUR HONOR TO OTHERS AND YOUR YEARS TO THE MERCILESS LEST STRANGERS TAKE THEIR FILL OF YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR LABORS GO TO THE HOUSE OF A FOREIGNER AND AT THE END OF YOUR LIFE YOU GROAN WHEN YOUR FLESH AND BODY ARE CONSUMED AND YOU SAY HOW I HATED DISCIPLINE AND MY HEART DESPISED REPROOF

I DID NOT LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF MY TEACHERS OR INCLINE MY EAR TO MY INSTRUCTORS

I AM AT THE BRINK OF UTTER RUIN IN THE ASSEMBLED CONGREGATION

 DRINK WATER FROM YOUR OWN CISTERN FLOWING WATER FROM YOUR OWN WELL

SHOULD YOUR SPRINGS BE SCATTERED ABROAD STREAMS OF WATER IN THE STREETS

LET THEM BE FOR YOURSELF ALONE AND NOT FOR STRANGERS WITH YOU

LET YOUR FOUNTAIN BE BLESSED AND REJOICE IN THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH A LOVELY DEER A GRACEFUL DOE

LET HER BREASTS FILL YOU AT ALL TIMES WITH DELIGHT; BE INTOXICATED ALWAYS IN HER LOVE

WHY SHOULD YOU BE INTOXICATED MY SON WITH A FORBIDDEN WOMAN AND EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF AN ADULTERESS

FOR A MAN'S WAYS ARE BEFORE THE EYES OF THE LORD AND HE PONDERS ALL HIS PATHS

THE INIQUITIES OF THE WICKED ENSNARE HIM AND HE IS HELD FAST IN THE CORDS OF HIS SIN

HE DIES FOR LACK OF DISCIPLINE AND BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT FOLLY HE IS LED ASTRAY

MY SON IF YOU HAVE PUT UP SECURITY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR HAVE GIVEN YOUR PLEDGE FOR A STRANGER IF YOU ARE SNARED IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH CAUGHT IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH THEN DO THIS MY SON AND SAVE YOURSELF FOR YOU HAVE COME INTO THE HAND OF YOUR NEIGHBOR GO HASTEN AND PLEAD URGENTLY WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR

GIVE YOUR EYES NO SLEEP AND YOUR EYELIDS NO SLUMBER; SAVE YOURSELF LIKE A GAZELLE FROM THE HAND OF THE HUNTER LIKE A BIRD FROM THE HAND OF THE FOWLER

GO TO THE ANT O SLUGGARD; CONSIDER HER WAYS AND BE WISE

WITHOUT HAVING ANY CHIEF OFFICER OR RULER SHE PREPARES HER BREAD IN SUMMER AND GATHERS HER FOOD IN HARVEST

HOW LONG WILL YOU LIE THERE O SLUGGARD

WHEN WILL YOU ARISE FROM YOUR SLEEP

A LITTLE SLEEP A LITTLE SLUMBER A LITTLE FOLDING OF THE HANDS TO REST AND POVERTY WILL COME UPON YOU LIKE A ROBBER AND WANT LIKE AN ARMED MAN

A WORTHLESS PERSON A WICKED MAN GOES ABOUT WITH CROOKED SPEECH WINKS WITH HIS EYES SIGNALS WITH HIS FEET POINTS WITH HIS FINGER WITH PERVERTED HEART DEVISES EVIL CONTINUALLY SOWING DISCORD; THEREFORE CALAMITY WILL COME UPON HIM SUDDENLY; IN A MOMENT HE WILL BE BROKEN BEYOND HEALING

THERE ARE SIX THINGS THAT THE LORD HATES SEVEN THAT ARE AN ABOMINATION TO HIM HAUGHTY EYES A LYING TONGUE AND HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD A HEART THAT DEVISES WICKED PLANS FEET THAT MAKE HASTE TO RUN TO EVIL A FALSE WITNESS WHO BREATHES OUT LIES AND ONE WHO SOWS DISCORD AMONG BROTHERS

MY SON KEEP YOUR FATHER'S COMMANDMENT AND FORSAKE NOT YOUR MOTHER'S TEACHING

BIND THEM ON YOUR HEART ALWAYS; TIE THEM AROUND YOUR NECK

WHEN YOU WALK THEY WILL LEAD YOU; WHEN YOU LIE DOWN THEY WILL WATCH OVER YOU; AND WHEN YOU AWAKE THEY WILL TALK WITH YOU

FOR THE COMMANDMENT IS A LAMP AND THE TEACHING A LIGHT AND THE REPROOFS OF DISCIPLINE ARE THE WAY OF LIFE TO PRESERVE YOU FROM THE EVIL WOMAN FROM THE SMOOTH TONGUE OF THE ADULTERESS

DO NOT DESIRE HER BEAUTY IN YOUR HEART AND DO NOT LET HER CAPTURE YOU WITH HER EYELASHES; FOR THE PRICE OF A PROSTITUTE IS ONLY A LOAF OF BREAD BUT A MARRIED WOMAN HUNTS DOWN A PRECIOUS LIFE

CAN A MAN CARRY FIRE NEXT TO HIS CHEST AND HIS CLOTHES NOT BE BURNED

OR CAN ONE WALK ON HOT COALS AND HIS FEET NOT BE SCORCHED

SO IS HE WHO GOES IN TO HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE; NONE WHO TOUCHES HER WILL GO UNPUNISHED

PEOPLE DO NOT DESPISE A THIEF IF HE STEALS TO SATISFY HIS APPETITE WHEN HE IS HUNGRY BUT IF HE IS CAUGHT HE WILL PAY SEVENFOLD; HE WILL GIVE ALL THE GOODS OF HIS HOUSE

HE WHO COMMITS ADULTERY LACKS SENSE; HE WHO DOES IT DESTROYS HIMSELF

WOUNDS AND DISHONOR WILL HE GET AND HIS DISGRACE WILL NOT BE WIPED AWAY

FOR JEALOUSY MAKES A MAN FURIOUS AND HE WILL NOT SPARE WHEN HE TAKES REVENGE

HE WILL ACCEPT NO COMPENSATION; HE WILL REFUSE THOUGH YOU MULTIPLY GIFTS

MY SON KEEP MY WORDS AND TREASURE UP MY COMMANDMENTS WITH YOU; KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE; KEEP MY TEACHING AS THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE; BIND THEM ON YOUR FINGERS; WRITE THEM ON THE TABLET OF YOUR HEART

SAY TO WISDOM YOU ARE MY SISTER AND CALL INSIGHT YOUR INTIMATE FRIEND TO KEEP YOU FROM THE FORBIDDEN WOMAN FROM THE ADULTERESS WITH HER SMOOTH WORDS

FOR AT THE WINDOW OF MY HOUSE I HAVE LOOKED OUT THROUGH MY LATTICE AND I HAVE SEEN AMONG THE SIMPLE I HAVE PERCEIVED AMONG THE YOUTHS A YOUNG MAN LACKING SENSE PASSING ALONG THE STREET NEAR HER CORNER TAKING THE ROAD TO HER HOUSE IN THE TWILIGHT IN THE EVENING AT THE TIME OF NIGHT AND DARKNESS

AND BEHOLD THE WOMAN MEETS HIM DRESSED AS A PROSTITUTE WILY OF HEART

SHE IS LOUD AND WAYWARD; HER FEET DO NOT STAY AT HOME; NOW IN THE STREET NOW IN THE MARKET AND AT EVERY CORNER SHE LIES IN WAIT

SHE SEIZES HIM AND KISSES HIM AND WITH BOLD FACE SHE SAYS TO HIM I HAD TO OFFER SACRIFICES AND TODAY I HAVE PAID MY VOWS; SO NOW I HAVE COME OUT TO MEET YOU TO SEEK YOU EAGERLY AND I HAVE FOUND YOU

I HAVE SPREAD MY COUCH WITH COVERINGS COLORED LINENS FROM EGYPTIAN LINEN; I HAVE PERFUMED MY BED WITH MYRRH ALOES AND CINNAMON

COME LET US TAKE OUR FILL OF LOVE TILL MORNING; LET US DELIGHT OURSELVES WITH LOVE

FOR MY HUSBAND IS NOT AT HOME; HE HAS GONE ON A LONG JOURNEY; HE TOOK A BAG OF MONEY WITH HIM; AT FULL MOON HE WILL COME HOME

 WITH MUCH SEDUCTIVE SPEECH SHE PERSUADES HIM; WITH HER SMOOTH TALK SHE COMPELS HIM

ALL AT ONCE HE FOLLOWS HER AS AN OX GOES TO THE SLAUGHTER OR AS A STAG IS CAUGHT FAST TILL AN ARROW PIERCES ITS LIVER; AS A BIRD RUSHES INTO A SNARE; HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT IT WILL COST HIM HIS LIFE

AND NOW O SONS LISTEN TO ME AND BE ATTENTIVE TO THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

LET NOT YOUR HEART TURN ASIDE TO HER WAYS; DO NOT STRAY INTO HER PATHS FOR MANY A VICTIM HAS SHE LAID LOW AND ALL HER SLAIN ARE A MIGHTY THRONG

HER HOUSE IS THE WAY TO SHEOL GOING DOWN TO THE CHAMBERS OF DEATH

DOES NOT WISDOM CALL

DOES NOT UNDERSTANDING RAISE HER VOICE

ON THE HEIGHTS BESIDE THE WAY AT THE CROSSROADS SHE TAKES HER STAND; BESIDE THE GATES IN FRONT OF THE TOWN AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PORTALS SHE CRIES ALOUD TO YOU O MEN I CALL AND MY CRY IS TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN

O SIMPLE ONES LEARN PRUDENCE; O FOOLS LEARN SENSE

HEAR FOR I WILL SPEAK NOBLE THINGS AND FROM MY LIPS WILL COME WHAT IS RIGHT FOR MY MOUTH WILL UTTER TRUTH; WICKEDNESS IS AN ABOMINATION TO MY LIPS

ALL THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH ARE RIGHTEOUS; THERE IS NOTHING TWISTED OR CROOKED IN THEM

THEY ARE ALL STRAIGHT TO HIM WHO UNDERSTANDS AND RIGHT TO THOSE WHO FIND KNOWLEDGE

TAKE MY INSTRUCTION INSTEAD OF SILVER AND KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN CHOICE GOLD FOR WISDOM IS BETTER THAN JEWELS AND ALL THAT YOU MAY DESIRE CANNOT COMPARE WITH HER

I WISDOM DWELL WITH PRUDENCE AND I FIND KNOWLEDGE AND DISCRETION

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS HATRED OF EVIL

PRIDE AND ARROGANCE AND THE WAY OF EVIL AND PERVERTED SPEECH I HATE

I HAVE COUNSEL AND SOUND WISDOM; I HAVE INSIGHT; I HAVE STRENGTH

BY ME KINGS REIGN AND RULERS DECREE WHAT IS JUST; BY ME PRINCES RULE AND NOBLES ALL WHO GOVERN JUSTLY

I LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE ME AND THOSE WHO SEEK ME DILIGENTLY FIND ME

RICHES AND HONOR ARE WITH ME ENDURING WEALTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS

MY FRUIT IS BETTER THAN GOLD EVEN FINE GOLD AND MY YIELD THAN CHOICE SILVER

I WALK IN THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE PATHS OF JUSTICE GRANTING AN INHERITANCE TO THOSE WHO LOVE ME AND FILLING THEIR TREASURIES

THE LORD POSSESSED ME AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS WORK THE FIRST OF HIS ACTS OF OLD

AGES AGO I WAS SET UP AT THE FIRST BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH

WHEN THERE WERE NO DEPTHS I WAS BROUGHT FORTH WHEN THERE WERE NO SPRINGS ABOUNDING WITH WATER

BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS HAD BEEN SHAPED BEFORE THE HILLS I WAS BROUGHT FORTH BEFORE HE HAD MADE THE EARTH WITH ITS FIELDS OR THE FIRST OF THE DUST OF THE WORLD

WHEN HE ESTABLISHED THE HEAVENS I WAS THERE; WHEN HE DREW A CIRCLE ON THE FACE OF THE DEEP WHEN HE MADE FIRM THE SKIES ABOVE WHEN HE ESTABLISHED THE FOUNTAINS OF THE DEEP WHEN HE ASSIGNED TO THE SEA ITS LIMIT SO THAT THE WATERS MIGHT NOT TRANSGRESS HIS COMMAND WHEN HE MARKED OUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH THEN I WAS BESIDE HIM LIKE A MASTER WORKMAN AND I WAS DAILY HIS DELIGHT REJOICING BEFORE HIM ALWAYS REJOICING IN HIS INHABITED WORLD AND DELIGHTING IN THE CHILDREN OF MAN

AND NOW O SONS LISTEN TO ME BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO KEEP MY WAYS

HEAR INSTRUCTION AND BE WISE AND DO NOT NEGLECT IT

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO LISTENS TO ME WATCHING DAILY AT MY GATES WAITING BESIDE MY DOORS

FOR WHOEVER FINDS ME FINDS LIFE AND OBTAINS FAVOR FROM THE LORD BUT HE WHO FAILS TO FIND ME INJURES HIMSELF; ALL WHO HATE ME LOVE DEATH

WISDOM HAS BUILT HER HOUSE; SHE HAS HEWN HER SEVEN PILLARS

SHE HAS SLAUGHTERED HER BEASTS; SHE HAS MIXED HER WINE; SHE HAS ALSO SET HER TABLE

SHE HAS SENT OUT HER YOUNG WOMEN TO CALL FROM THE HIGHEST PLACES IN THE TOWN WHOEVER IS SIMPLE LET HIM TURN IN HERE

 TO HIM WHO LACKS SENSE SHE SAYS COME EAT OF MY BREAD AND DRINK OF THE WINE I HAVE MIXED

LEAVE YOUR SIMPLE WAYS AND LIVE AND WALK IN THE WAY OF INSIGHT

 WHOEVER CORRECTS A SCOFFER GETS HIMSELF ABUSE AND HE WHO REPROVES A WICKED MAN INCURS INJURY

DO NOT REPROVE A SCOFFER OR HE WILL HATE YOU; REPROVE A WISE MAN AND HE WILL LOVE YOU

GIVE INSTRUCTION TO A WISE MAN AND HE WILL BE STILL WISER; TEACH A RIGHTEOUS MAN AND HE WILL INCREASE IN LEARNING

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLY ONE IS INSIGHT

FOR BY ME YOUR DAYS WILL BE MULTIPLIED AND YEARS WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR LIFE

IF YOU ARE WISE YOU ARE WISE FOR YOURSELF; IF YOU SCOFF YOU ALONE WILL BEAR IT

THE WOMAN FOLLY IS LOUD; SHE IS SEDUCTIVE AND KNOWS NOTHING

SHE SITS AT THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE; SHE TAKES A SEAT ON THE HIGHEST PLACES OF THE TOWN CALLING TO THOSE WHO PASS BY WHO ARE GOING STRAIGHT ON THEIR WAY WHOEVER IS SIMPLE LET HIM TURN IN HERE

 AND TO HIM WHO LACKS SENSE SHE SAYS STOLEN WATER IS SWEET AND BREAD EATEN IN SECRET IS PLEASANT

 BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE DEAD ARE THERE THAT HER GUESTS ARE IN THE DEPTHS OF SHEOL

THE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON

A WISE SON MAKES A GLAD FATHER BUT A FOOLISH SON IS A SORROW TO HIS MOTHER

TREASURES GAINED BY WICKEDNESS DO NOT PROFIT BUT RIGHTEOUSNESS DELIVERS FROM DEATH

THE LORD DOES NOT LET THE RIGHTEOUS GO HUNGRY BUT HE THWARTS THE CRAVING OF THE WICKED

A SLACK HAND CAUSES POVERTY BUT THE HAND OF THE DILIGENT MAKES RICH

HE WHO GATHERS IN SUMMER IS A PRUDENT SON BUT HE WHO SLEEPS IN HARVEST IS A SON WHO BRINGS SHAME

BLESSINGS ARE ON THE HEAD OF THE RIGHTEOUS BUT THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED CONCEALS VIOLENCE

THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A BLESSING BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED WILL ROT

THE WISE OF HEART WILL RECEIVE COMMANDMENTS BUT A BABBLING FOOL WILL COME TO RUIN

WHOEVER WALKS IN INTEGRITY WALKS SECURELY BUT HE WHO MAKES HIS WAYS CROOKED WILL BE FOUND OUT

WHOEVER WINKS THE EYE CAUSES TROUBLE BUT A BABBLING FOOL WILL COME TO RUIN

THE MOUTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A FOUNTAIN OF LIFE BUT THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED CONCEALS VIOLENCE

HATRED STIRS UP STRIFE BUT LOVE COVERS ALL OFFENSES

ON THE LIPS OF HIM WHO HAS UNDERSTANDING WISDOM IS FOUND BUT A ROD IS FOR THE BACK OF HIM WHO LACKS SENSE

THE WISE LAY UP KNOWLEDGE BUT THE MOUTH OF A FOOL BRINGS RUIN NEAR

A RICH MAN'S WEALTH IS HIS STRONG CITY; THE POVERTY OF THE POOR IS THEIR RUIN

THE WAGE OF THE RIGHTEOUS LEADS TO LIFE THE GAIN OF THE WICKED TO SIN

WHOEVER HEEDS INSTRUCTION IS ON THE PATH TO LIFE BUT HE WHO REJECTS REPROOF LEADS OTHERS ASTRAY

THE ONE WHO CONCEALS HATRED HAS LYING LIPS AND WHOEVER UTTERS SLANDER IS A FOOL

WHEN WORDS ARE MANY TRANSGRESSION IS NOT LACKING BUT WHOEVER RESTRAINS HIS LIPS IS PRUDENT

THE TONGUE OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS CHOICE SILVER; THE HEART OF THE WICKED IS OF LITTLE WORTH

THE LIPS OF THE RIGHTEOUS FEED MANY BUT FOOLS DIE FOR LACK OF SENSE

THE BLESSING OF THE LORD MAKES RICH AND HE ADDS NO SORROW WITH IT

DOING WRONG IS LIKE A JOKE TO A FOOL BUT WISDOM IS PLEASURE TO A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING

WHAT THE WICKED DREADS WILL COME UPON HIM BUT THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHTEOUS WILL BE GRANTED

WHEN THE TEMPEST PASSES THE WICKED IS NO MORE BUT THE RIGHTEOUS IS ESTABLISHED FOREVER

LIKE VINEGAR TO THE TEETH AND SMOKE TO THE EYES SO IS THE SLUGGARD TO THOSE WHO SEND HIM

THE FEAR OF THE LORD PROLONGS LIFE BUT THE YEARS OF THE WICKED WILL BE SHORT

THE HOPE OF THE RIGHTEOUS BRINGS JOY BUT THE EXPECTATION OF THE WICKED WILL PERISH

THE WAY OF THE LORD IS A STRONGHOLD TO THE BLAMELESS BUT DESTRUCTION TO EVILDOERS

THE RIGHTEOUS WILL NEVER BE REMOVED BUT THE WICKED WILL NOT DWELL IN THE LAND

THE MOUTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS BRINGS FORTH WISDOM BUT THE PERVERSE TONGUE WILL BE CUT OFF

THE LIPS OF THE RIGHTEOUS KNOW WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE BUT THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED WHAT IS PERVERSE

A FALSE BALANCE IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT A JUST WEIGHT IS HIS DELIGHT

WHEN PRIDE COMES THEN COMES DISGRACE BUT WITH THE HUMBLE IS WISDOM

THE INTEGRITY OF THE UPRIGHT GUIDES THEM BUT THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE TREACHEROUS DESTROYS THEM

RICHES DO NOT PROFIT IN THE DAY OF WRATH BUT RIGHTEOUSNESS DELIVERS FROM DEATH

THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE BLAMELESS KEEPS HIS WAY STRAIGHT BUT THE WICKED FALLS BY HIS OWN WICKEDNESS

THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE UPRIGHT DELIVERS THEM BUT THE TREACHEROUS ARE TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THEIR LUST

WHEN THE WICKED DIES HIS HOPE WILL PERISH AND THE EXPECTATION OF WEALTH PERISHES TOO

THE RIGHTEOUS IS DELIVERED FROM TROUBLE AND THE WICKED WALKS INTO IT INSTEAD

WITH HIS MOUTH THE GODLESS MAN WOULD DESTROY HIS NEIGHBOR BUT BY KNOWLEDGE THE RIGHTEOUS ARE DELIVERED

WHEN IT GOES WELL WITH THE RIGHTEOUS THE CITY REJOICES AND WHEN THE WICKED PERISH THERE ARE SHOUTS OF GLADNESS

BY THE BLESSING OF THE UPRIGHT A CITY IS EXALTED BUT BY THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED IT IS OVERTHROWN

WHOEVER BELITTLES HIS NEIGHBOR LACKS SENSE BUT A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING REMAINS SILENT

WHOEVER GOES ABOUT SLANDERING REVEALS SECRETS BUT HE WHO IS TRUSTWORTHY IN SPIRIT KEEPS A THING COVERED

WHERE THERE IS NO GUIDANCE A PEOPLE FALLS BUT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF COUNSELORS THERE IS SAFETY

WHOEVER PUTS UP SECURITY FOR A STRANGER WILL SURELY SUFFER HARM BUT HE WHO HATES STRIKING HANDS IN PLEDGE IS SECURE

A GRACIOUS WOMAN GETS HONOR AND VIOLENT MEN GET RICHES

A MAN WHO IS KIND BENEFITS HIMSELF BUT A CRUEL MAN HURTS HIMSELF

THE WICKED EARNS DECEPTIVE WAGES BUT ONE WHO SOWS RIGHTEOUSNESS GETS A SURE REWARD

WHOEVER IS STEADFAST IN RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL LIVE BUT HE WHO PURSUES EVIL WILL DIE

THOSE OF CROOKED HEART ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT THOSE OF BLAMELESS WAYS ARE HIS DELIGHT

BE ASSURED AN EVIL PERSON WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED BUT THE OFFSPRING OF THE RIGHTEOUS WILL BE DELIVERED

LIKE A GOLD RING IN A PIG'S SNOUT IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITHOUT DISCRETION

THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHTEOUS ENDS ONLY IN GOOD; THE EXPECTATION OF THE WICKED IN WRATH

ONE GIVES FREELY YET GROWS ALL THE RICHER; ANOTHER WITHHOLDS WHAT HE SHOULD GIVE AND ONLY SUFFERS WANT

WHOEVER BRINGS BLESSING WILL BE ENRICHED AND ONE WHO WATERS WILL HIMSELF BE WATERED

THE PEOPLE CURSE HIM WHO HOLDS BACK GRAIN BUT A BLESSING IS ON THE HEAD OF HIM WHO SELLS IT

WHOEVER DILIGENTLY SEEKS GOOD SEEKS FAVOR BUT EVIL COMES TO HIM WHO SEARCHES FOR IT

WHOEVER TRUSTS IN HIS RICHES WILL FALL BUT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL FLOURISH LIKE A GREEN LEAF

WHOEVER TROUBLES HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD WILL INHERIT THE WIND AND THE FOOL WILL BE SERVANT TO THE WISE OF HEART

THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE AND WHOEVER CAPTURES SOULS IS WISE

IF THE RIGHTEOUS IS REPAID ON EARTH HOW MUCH MORE THE WICKED AND THE SINNER

WHOEVER LOVES DISCIPLINE LOVES KNOWLEDGE BUT HE WHO HATES REPROOF IS STUPID

A GOOD MAN OBTAINS FAVOR FROM THE LORD BUT A MAN OF EVIL DEVICES HE CONDEMNS

NO ONE IS ESTABLISHED BY WICKEDNESS BUT THE ROOT OF THE RIGHTEOUS WILL NEVER BE MOVED

AN EXCELLENT WIFE IS THE CROWN OF HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WHO BRINGS SHAME IS LIKE ROTTENNESS IN HIS BONES

THE THOUGHTS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARE JUST; THE COUNSELS OF THE WICKED ARE DECEITFUL

THE WORDS OF THE WICKED LIE IN WAIT FOR BLOOD BUT THE MOUTH OF THE UPRIGHT DELIVERS THEM

THE WICKED ARE OVERTHROWN AND ARE NO MORE BUT THE HOUSE OF THE RIGHTEOUS WILL STAND

A MAN IS COMMENDED ACCORDING TO HIS GOOD SENSE BUT ONE OF TWISTED MIND IS DESPISED

BETTER TO BE LOWLY AND HAVE A SERVANT THAN TO PLAY THE GREAT MAN AND LACK BREAD

WHOEVER IS RIGHTEOUS HAS REGARD FOR THE LIFE OF HIS BEAST BUT THE MERCY OF THE WICKED IS CRUEL

WHOEVER WORKS HIS LAND WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BREAD BUT HE WHO FOLLOWS WORTHLESS PURSUITS LACKS SENSE

WHOEVER IS WICKED COVETS THE SPOIL OF EVILDOERS BUT THE ROOT OF THE RIGHTEOUS BEARS FRUIT

AN EVIL MAN IS ENSNARED BY THE TRANSGRESSION OF HIS LIPS BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ESCAPES FROM TROUBLE

FROM THE FRUIT OF HIS MOUTH A MAN IS SATISFIED WITH GOOD AND THE WORK OF A MAN'S HAND COMES BACK TO HIM

THE WAY OF A FOOL IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES BUT A WISE MAN LISTENS TO ADVICE

THE VEXATION OF A FOOL IS KNOWN AT ONCE BUT THE PRUDENT IGNORES AN INSULT

WHOEVER SPEAKS THE TRUTH GIVES HONEST EVIDENCE BUT A FALSE WITNESS UTTERS DECEIT

THERE IS ONE WHOSE RASH WORDS ARE LIKE SWORD THRUSTS BUT THE TONGUE OF THE WISE BRINGS HEALING

TRUTHFUL LIPS ENDURE FOREVER BUT A LYING TONGUE IS BUT FOR A MOMENT

DECEIT IS IN THE HEART OF THOSE WHO DEVISE EVIL BUT THOSE WHO PLAN PEACE HAVE JOY

NO ILL BEFALLS THE RIGHTEOUS BUT THE WICKED ARE FILLED WITH TROUBLE

LYING LIPS ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT THOSE WHO ACT FAITHFULLY ARE HIS DELIGHT

A PRUDENT MAN CONCEALS KNOWLEDGE BUT THE HEART OF FOOLS PROCLAIMS FOLLY

THE HAND OF THE DILIGENT WILL RULE WHILE THE SLOTHFUL WILL BE PUT TO FORCED LABOR

ANXIETY IN A MAN'S HEART WEIGHS HIM DOWN BUT A GOOD WORD MAKES HIM GLAD

ONE WHO IS RIGHTEOUS IS A GUIDE TO HIS NEIGHBOR BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED LEADS THEM ASTRAY

WHOEVER IS SLOTHFUL WILL NOT ROAST HIS GAME BUT THE DILIGENT MAN WILL GET PRECIOUS WEALTH

IN THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIFE AND IN ITS PATHWAY THERE IS NO DEATH

A WISE SON HEARS HIS FATHER'S INSTRUCTION BUT A SCOFFER DOES NOT LISTEN TO REBUKE

FROM THE FRUIT OF HIS MOUTH A MAN EATS WHAT IS GOOD BUT THE DESIRE OF THE TREACHEROUS IS FOR VIOLENCE

WHOEVER GUARDS HIS MOUTH PRESERVES HIS LIFE; HE WHO OPENS WIDE HIS LIPS COMES TO RUIN

THE SOUL OF THE SLUGGARD CRAVES AND GETS NOTHING WHILE THE SOUL OF THE DILIGENT IS RICHLY SUPPLIED

THE RIGHTEOUS HATES FALSEHOOD BUT THE WICKED BRINGS SHAME AND DISGRACE

RIGHTEOUSNESS GUARDS HIM WHOSE WAY IS BLAMELESS BUT SIN OVERTHROWS THE WICKED

ONE PRETENDS TO BE RICH YET HAS NOTHING; ANOTHER PRETENDS TO BE POOR YET HAS GREAT WEALTH

THE RANSOM OF A MAN'S LIFE IS HIS WEALTH BUT A POOR MAN HEARS NO THREAT

THE LIGHT OF THE RIGHTEOUS REJOICES BUT THE LAMP OF THE WICKED WILL BE PUT OUT

BY INSOLENCE COMES NOTHING BUT STRIFE BUT WITH THOSE WHO TAKE ADVICE IS WISDOM

WEALTH GAINED HASTILY WILL DWINDLE BUT WHOEVER GATHERS LITTLE BY LITTLE WILL INCREASE IT

HOPE DEFERRED MAKES THE HEART SICK BUT A DESIRE FULFILLED IS A TREE OF LIFE

WHOEVER DESPISES THE WORD BRINGS DESTRUCTION ON HIMSELF BUT HE WHO REVERES THE COMMANDMENT WILL BE REWARDED

THE TEACHING OF THE WISE IS A FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THAT ONE MAY TURN AWAY FROM THE SNARES OF DEATH

GOOD SENSE WINS FAVOR BUT THE WAY OF THE TREACHEROUS IS THEIR RUIN

IN EVERYTHING THE PRUDENT ACTS WITH KNOWLEDGE BUT A FOOL FLAUNTS HIS FOLLY

A WICKED MESSENGER FALLS INTO TROUBLE BUT A FAITHFUL ENVOY BRINGS HEALING

POVERTY AND DISGRACE COME TO HIM WHO IGNORES INSTRUCTION BUT WHOEVER HEEDS REPROOF IS HONORED

A DESIRE FULFILLED IS SWEET TO THE SOUL BUT TO TURN AWAY FROM EVIL IS AN ABOMINATION TO FOOLS

WHOEVER WALKS WITH THE WISE BECOMES WISE BUT THE COMPANION OF FOOLS WILL SUFFER HARM

DISASTER PURSUES SINNERS BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE REWARDED WITH GOOD

A GOOD MAN LEAVES AN INHERITANCE TO HIS CHILDREN'S CHILDREN BUT THE SINNER'S WEALTH IS LAID UP FOR THE RIGHTEOUS

THE FALLOW GROUND OF THE POOR WOULD YIELD MUCH FOOD BUT IT IS SWEPT AWAY THROUGH INJUSTICE

WHOEVER SPARES THE ROD HATES HIS SON BUT HE WHO LOVES HIM IS DILIGENT TO DISCIPLINE HIM

THE RIGHTEOUS HAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY HIS APPETITE BUT THE BELLY OF THE WICKED SUFFERS WANT

THE WISEST OF WOMEN BUILDS HER HOUSE BUT FOLLY WITH HER OWN HANDS TEARS IT DOWN

WHOEVER WALKS IN UPRIGHTNESS FEARS THE LORD BUT HE WHO IS DEVIOUS IN HIS WAYS DESPISES HIM

BY THE MOUTH OF A FOOL COMES A ROD FOR HIS BACK BUT THE LIPS OF THE WISE WILL PRESERVE THEM

WHERE THERE ARE NO OXEN THE MANGER IS CLEAN BUT ABUNDANT CROPS COME BY THE STRENGTH OF THE OX

A FAITHFUL WITNESS DOES NOT LIE BUT A FALSE WITNESS BREATHES OUT LIES

A SCOFFER SEEKS WISDOM IN VAIN BUT KNOWLEDGE IS EASY FOR A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING

LEAVE THE PRESENCE OF A FOOL FOR THERE YOU DO NOT MEET WORDS OF KNOWLEDGE

THE WISDOM OF THE PRUDENT IS TO DISCERN HIS WAY BUT THE FOLLY OF FOOLS IS DECEIVING

FOOLS MOCK AT THE GUILT OFFERING BUT THE UPRIGHT ENJOY ACCEPTANCE

THE HEART KNOWS ITS OWN BITTERNESS AND NO STRANGER SHARES ITS JOY

THE HOUSE OF THE WICKED WILL BE DESTROYED BUT THE TENT OF THE UPRIGHT WILL FLOURISH

THERE IS A WAY THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO A MAN BUT ITS END IS THE WAY TO DEATH

EVEN IN LAUGHTER THE HEART MAY ACHE AND THE END OF JOY MAY BE GRIEF

THE BACKSLIDER IN HEART WILL BE FILLED WITH THE FRUIT OF HIS WAYS AND A GOOD MAN WILL BE FILLED WITH THE FRUIT OF HIS WAYS

THE SIMPLE BELIEVES EVERYTHING BUT THE PRUDENT GIVES THOUGHT TO HIS STEPS

ONE WHO IS WISE IS CAUTIOUS AND TURNS AWAY FROM EVIL BUT A FOOL IS RECKLESS AND CARELESS

A MAN OF QUICK TEMPER ACTS FOOLISHLY AND A MAN OF EVIL DEVICES IS HATED

THE SIMPLE INHERIT FOLLY BUT THE PRUDENT ARE CROWNED WITH KNOWLEDGE

THE EVIL BOW DOWN BEFORE THE GOOD THE WICKED AT THE GATES OF THE RIGHTEOUS

THE POOR IS DISLIKED EVEN BY HIS NEIGHBOR BUT THE RICH HAS MANY FRIENDS

WHOEVER DESPISES HIS NEIGHBOR IS A SINNER BUT BLESSED IS HE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR

DO THEY NOT GO ASTRAY WHO DEVISE EVIL

THOSE WHO DEVISE GOOD MEET STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS

IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT BUT MERE TALK TENDS ONLY TO POVERTY

THE CROWN OF THE WISE IS THEIR WEALTH BUT THE FOLLY OF FOOLS BRINGS FOLLY

A TRUTHFUL WITNESS SAVES LIVES BUT ONE WHO BREATHES OUT LIES IS DECEITFUL

IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD ONE HAS STRONG CONFIDENCE AND HIS CHILDREN WILL HAVE A REFUGE

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS A FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THAT ONE MAY TURN AWAY FROM THE SNARES OF DEATH

IN A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE IS THE GLORY OF A KING BUT WITHOUT PEOPLE A PRINCE IS RUINED

WHOEVER IS SLOW TO ANGER HAS GREAT UNDERSTANDING BUT HE WHO HAS A HASTY TEMPER EXALTS FOLLY

A TRANQUIL HEART GIVES LIFE TO THE FLESH BUT ENVY MAKES THE BONES ROT

WHOEVER OPPRESSES A POOR MAN INSULTS HIS MAKER BUT HE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE NEEDY HONORS HIM

THE WICKED IS OVERTHROWN THROUGH HIS EVILDOING BUT THE RIGHTEOUS FINDS REFUGE IN HIS DEATH

WISDOM RESTS IN THE HEART OF A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING BUT IT MAKES ITSELF KNOWN EVEN IN THE MIDST OF FOOLS

RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTS A NATION BUT SIN IS A REPROACH TO ANY PEOPLE

A SERVANT WHO DEALS WISELY HAS THE KING'S FAVOR BUT HIS WRATH FALLS ON ONE WHO ACTS SHAMEFULLY

A SOFT ANSWER TURNS AWAY WRATH BUT A HARSH WORD STIRS UP ANGER

THE TONGUE OF THE WISE COMMENDS KNOWLEDGE BUT THE MOUTHS OF FOOLS POUR OUT FOLLY

THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE IN EVERY PLACE KEEPING WATCH ON THE EVIL AND THE GOOD

A GENTLE TONGUE IS A TREE OF LIFE BUT PERVERSENESS IN IT BREAKS THE SPIRIT

A FOOL DESPISES HIS FATHER'S INSTRUCTION BUT WHOEVER HEEDS REPROOF IS PRUDENT

IN THE HOUSE OF THE RIGHTEOUS THERE IS MUCH TREASURE BUT TROUBLE BEFALLS THE INCOME OF THE WICKED

THE LIPS OF THE WISE SPREAD KNOWLEDGE; NOT SO THE HEARTS OF FOOLS

THE SACRIFICE OF THE WICKED IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT THE PRAYER OF THE UPRIGHT IS ACCEPTABLE TO HIM

THE WAY OF THE WICKED IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT HE LOVES HIM WHO PURSUES RIGHTEOUSNESS

THERE IS SEVERE DISCIPLINE FOR HIM WHO FORSAKES THE WAY; WHOEVER HATES REPROOF WILL DIE

SHEOL AND ABADDON LIE OPEN BEFORE THE LORD; HOW MUCH MORE THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN

A SCOFFER DOES NOT LIKE TO BE REPROVED; HE WILL NOT GO TO THE WISE

A GLAD HEART MAKES A CHEERFUL FACE BUT BY SORROW OF HEART THE SPIRIT IS CRUSHED

THE HEART OF HIM WHO HAS UNDERSTANDING SEEKS KNOWLEDGE BUT THE MOUTHS OF FOOLS FEED ON FOLLY

ALL THE DAYS OF THE AFFLICTED ARE EVIL BUT THE CHEERFUL OF HEART HAS A CONTINUAL FEAST

BETTER IS A LITTLE WITH THE FEAR OF THE LORD THAN GREAT TREASURE AND TROUBLE WITH IT

BETTER IS A DINNER OF HERBS WHERE LOVE IS THAN A FATTENED OX AND HATRED WITH IT

A HOTTEMPERED MAN STIRS UP STRIFE BUT HE WHO IS SLOW TO ANGER QUIETS CONTENTION

THE WAY OF A SLUGGARD IS LIKE A HEDGE OF THORNS BUT THE PATH OF THE UPRIGHT IS A LEVEL HIGHWAY

A WISE SON MAKES A GLAD FATHER BUT A FOOLISH MAN DESPISES HIS MOTHER

FOLLY IS A JOY TO HIM WHO LACKS SENSE BUT A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING WALKS STRAIGHT AHEAD

WITHOUT COUNSEL PLANS FAIL BUT WITH MANY ADVISERS THEY SUCCEED

TO MAKE AN APT ANSWER IS A JOY TO A MAN AND A WORD IN SEASON HOW GOOD IT IS

THE PATH OF LIFE LEADS UPWARD FOR THE PRUDENT THAT HE MAY TURN AWAY FROM SHEOL BENEATH

THE LORD TEARS DOWN THE HOUSE OF THE PROUD BUT MAINTAINS THE WIDOW'S BOUNDARIES

THE THOUGHTS OF THE WICKED ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD BUT GRACIOUS WORDS ARE PURE

WHOEVER IS GREEDY FOR UNJUST GAIN TROUBLES HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD BUT HE WHO HATES BRIBES WILL LIVE

THE HEART OF THE RIGHTEOUS PONDERS HOW TO ANSWER BUT THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED POURS OUT EVIL THINGS

THE LORD IS FAR FROM THE WICKED BUT HE HEARS THE PRAYER OF THE RIGHTEOUS

THE LIGHT OF THE EYES REJOICES THE HEART AND GOOD NEWS REFRESHES THE BONES

THE EAR THAT LISTENS TO LIFEGIVING REPROOF WILL DWELL AMONG THE WISE

WHOEVER IGNORES INSTRUCTION DESPISES HIMSELF BUT HE WHO LISTENS TO REPROOF GAINS INTELLIGENCE

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS INSTRUCTION IN WISDOM AND HUMILITY COMES BEFORE HONOR

THE PLANS OF THE HEART BELONG TO MAN BUT THE ANSWER OF THE TONGUE IS FROM THE LORD

ALL THE WAYS OF A MAN ARE PURE IN HIS OWN EYES BUT THE LORD WEIGHS THE SPIRIT

COMMIT YOUR WORK TO THE LORD AND YOUR PLANS WILL BE ESTABLISHED

THE LORD HAS MADE EVERYTHING FOR ITS PURPOSE EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF TROUBLE

EVERYONE WHO IS ARROGANT IN HEART IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD; BE ASSURED HE WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED

BY STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS INIQUITY IS ATONED FOR AND BY THE FEAR OF THE LORD ONE TURNS AWAY FROM EVIL

WHEN A MAN'S WAYS PLEASE THE LORD HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM

BETTER IS A LITTLE WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS THAN GREAT REVENUES WITH INJUSTICE

THE HEART OF MAN PLANS HIS WAY BUT THE LORD ESTABLISHES HIS STEPS

AN ORACLE IS ON THE LIPS OF A KING; HIS MOUTH DOES NOT SIN IN JUDGMENT

A JUST BALANCE AND SCALES ARE THE LORD'S; ALL THE WEIGHTS IN THE BAG ARE HIS WORK

IT IS AN ABOMINATION TO KINGS TO DO EVIL FOR THE THRONE IS ESTABLISHED BY RIGHTEOUSNESS

RIGHTEOUS LIPS ARE THE DELIGHT OF A KING AND HE LOVES HIM WHO SPEAKS WHAT IS RIGHT

A KING'S WRATH IS A MESSENGER OF DEATH AND A WISE MAN WILL APPEASE IT

IN THE LIGHT OF A KING'S FACE THERE IS LIFE AND HIS FAVOR IS LIKE THE CLOUDS THAT BRING THE SPRING RAIN

HOW MUCH BETTER TO GET WISDOM THAN GOLD

TO GET UNDERSTANDING IS TO BE CHOSEN RATHER THAN SILVER

THE HIGHWAY OF THE UPRIGHT TURNS ASIDE FROM EVIL; WHOEVER GUARDS HIS WAY PRESERVES HIS LIFE

PRIDE GOES BEFORE DESTRUCTION AND A HAUGHTY SPIRIT BEFORE A FALL

IT IS BETTER TO BE OF A LOWLY SPIRIT WITH THE POOR THAN TO DIVIDE THE SPOIL WITH THE PROUD

WHOEVER GIVES THOUGHT TO THE WORD WILL DISCOVER GOOD AND BLESSED IS HE WHO TRUSTS IN THE LORD

THE WISE OF HEART IS CALLED DISCERNING AND SWEETNESS OF SPEECH INCREASES PERSUASIVENESS

GOOD SENSE IS A FOUNTAIN OF LIFE TO HIM WHO HAS IT BUT THE INSTRUCTION OF FOOLS IS FOLLY

THE HEART OF THE WISE MAKES HIS SPEECH JUDICIOUS AND ADDS PERSUASIVENESS TO HIS LIPS

GRACIOUS WORDS ARE LIKE A HONEYCOMB SWEETNESS TO THE SOUL AND HEALTH TO THE BODY

THERE IS A WAY THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO A MAN BUT ITS END IS THE WAY TO DEATH

A WORKER'S APPETITE WORKS FOR HIM; HIS MOUTH URGES HIM ON

A WORTHLESS MAN PLOTS EVIL AND HIS SPEECH IS LIKE A SCORCHING FIRE

A DISHONEST MAN SPREADS STRIFE AND A WHISPERER SEPARATES CLOSE FRIENDS

A MAN OF VIOLENCE ENTICES HIS NEIGHBOR AND LEADS HIM IN A WAY THAT IS NOT GOOD

WHOEVER WINKS HIS EYES PLANS DISHONEST THINGS; HE WHO PURSES HIS LIPS BRINGS EVIL TO PASS

GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY; IT IS GAINED IN A RIGHTEOUS LIFE

WHOEVER IS SLOW TO ANGER IS BETTER THAN THE MIGHTY AND HE WHO RULES HIS SPIRIT THAN HE WHO TAKES A CITY

THE LOT IS CAST INTO THE LAP BUT ITS EVERY DECISION IS FROM THE LORD

BETTER IS A DRY MORSEL WITH QUIET THAN A HOUSE FULL OF FEASTING WITH STRIFE

A SERVANT WHO DEALS WISELY WILL RULE OVER A SON WHO ACTS SHAMEFULLY AND WILL SHARE THE INHERITANCE AS ONE OF THE BROTHERS

THE CRUCIBLE IS FOR SILVER AND THE FURNACE IS FOR GOLD AND THE LORD TESTS HEARTS

AN EVILDOER LISTENS TO WICKED LIPS AND A LIAR GIVES EAR TO A MISCHIEVOUS TONGUE

WHOEVER MOCKS THE POOR INSULTS HIS MAKER; HE WHO IS GLAD AT CALAMITY WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED

GRANDCHILDREN ARE THE CROWN OF THE AGED AND THE GLORY OF CHILDREN IS THEIR FATHERS

FINE SPEECH IS NOT BECOMING TO A FOOL; STILL LESS IS FALSE SPEECH TO A PRINCE

A BRIBE IS LIKE A MAGIC STONE IN THE EYES OF THE ONE WHO GIVES IT; WHEREVER HE TURNS HE PROSPERS

WHOEVER COVERS AN OFFENSE SEEKS LOVE BUT HE WHO REPEATS A MATTER SEPARATES CLOSE FRIENDS

A REBUKE GOES DEEPER INTO A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING THAN A HUNDRED BLOWS INTO A FOOL

AN EVIL MAN SEEKS ONLY REBELLION AND A CRUEL MESSENGER WILL BE SENT AGAINST HIM

LET A MAN MEET A SHEBEAR ROBBED OF HER CUBS RATHER THAN A FOOL IN HIS FOLLY

IF ANYONE RETURNS EVIL FOR GOOD EVIL WILL NOT DEPART FROM HIS HOUSE

THE BEGINNING OF STRIFE IS LIKE LETTING OUT WATER SO QUIT BEFORE THE QUARREL BREAKS OUT

HE WHO JUSTIFIES THE WICKED AND HE WHO CONDEMNS THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOTH ALIKE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD

WHY SHOULD A FOOL HAVE MONEY IN HIS HAND TO BUY WISDOM WHEN HE HAS NO SENSE

A FRIEND LOVES AT ALL TIMES AND A BROTHER IS BORN FOR ADVERSITY

ONE WHO LACKS SENSE GIVES A PLEDGE AND PUTS UP SECURITY IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS NEIGHBOR

WHOEVER LOVES TRANSGRESSION LOVES STRIFE; HE WHO MAKES HIS DOOR HIGH SEEKS DESTRUCTION

A MAN OF CROOKED HEART DOES NOT DISCOVER GOOD AND ONE WITH A DISHONEST TONGUE FALLS INTO CALAMITY

HE WHO SIRES A FOOL GETS HIMSELF SORROW AND THE FATHER OF A FOOL HAS NO JOY

A JOYFUL HEART IS GOOD MEDICINE BUT A CRUSHED SPIRIT DRIES UP THE BONES

THE WICKED ACCEPTS A BRIBE IN SECRET TO PERVERT THE WAYS OF JUSTICE

THE DISCERNING SETS HIS FACE TOWARD WISDOM BUT THE EYES OF A FOOL ARE ON THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

A FOOLISH SON IS A GRIEF TO HIS FATHER AND BITTERNESS TO HER WHO BORE HIM

TO IMPOSE A FINE ON A RIGHTEOUS MAN IS NOT GOOD NOR TO STRIKE THE NOBLE FOR THEIR UPRIGHTNESS

WHOEVER RESTRAINS HIS WORDS HAS KNOWLEDGE AND HE WHO HAS A COOL SPIRIT IS A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING

EVEN A FOOL WHO KEEPS SILENT IS CONSIDERED WISE; WHEN HE CLOSES HIS LIPS HE IS DEEMED INTELLIGENT

WHOEVER ISOLATES HIMSELF SEEKS HIS OWN DESIRE; HE BREAKS OUT AGAINST ALL SOUND JUDGMENT

A FOOL TAKES NO PLEASURE IN UNDERSTANDING BUT ONLY IN EXPRESSING HIS OPINION

WHEN WICKEDNESS COMES CONTEMPT COMES ALSO AND WITH DISHONOR COMES DISGRACE

THE WORDS OF A MAN'S MOUTH ARE DEEP WATERS; THE FOUNTAIN OF WISDOM IS A BUBBLING BROOK

IT IS NOT GOOD TO BE PARTIAL TO THE WICKED OR TO DEPRIVE THE RIGHTEOUS OF JUSTICE

A FOOL'S LIPS WALK INTO A FIGHT AND HIS MOUTH INVITES A BEATING

A FOOL'S MOUTH IS HIS RUIN AND HIS LIPS ARE A SNARE TO HIS SOUL

THE WORDS OF A WHISPERER ARE LIKE DELICIOUS MORSELS; THEY GO DOWN INTO THE INNER PARTS OF THE BODY

WHOEVER IS SLACK IN HIS WORK IS A BROTHER TO HIM WHO DESTROYS

THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER; THE RIGHTEOUS MAN RUNS INTO IT AND IS SAFE

A RICH MAN'S WEALTH IS HIS STRONG CITY AND LIKE A HIGH WALL IN HIS IMAGINATION

BEFORE DESTRUCTION A MAN'S HEART IS HAUGHTY BUT HUMILITY COMES BEFORE HONOR

IF ONE GIVES AN ANSWER BEFORE HE HEARS IT IS HIS FOLLY AND SHAME

A MAN'S SPIRIT WILL ENDURE SICKNESS BUT A CRUSHED SPIRIT WHO CAN BEAR

AN INTELLIGENT HEART ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND THE EAR OF THE WISE SEEKS KNOWLEDGE

A MAN'S GIFT MAKES ROOM FOR HIM AND BRINGS HIM BEFORE THE GREAT

THE ONE WHO STATES HIS CASE FIRST SEEMS RIGHT UNTIL THE OTHER COMES AND EXAMINES HIM

THE LOT PUTS AN END TO QUARRELS AND DECIDES BETWEEN POWERFUL CONTENDERS

A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE UNYIELDING THAN A STRONG CITY AND QUARRELING IS LIKE THE BARS OF A CASTLE

FROM THE FRUIT OF A MAN'S MOUTH HIS STOMACH IS SATISFIED; HE IS SATISFIED BY THE YIELD OF HIS LIPS

DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE AND THOSE WHO LOVE IT WILL EAT ITS FRUITS

HE WHO FINDS A WIFE FINDS A GOOD THING AND OBTAINS FAVOR FROM THE LORD

THE POOR USE ENTREATIES BUT THE RICH ANSWER ROUGHLY

A MAN OF MANY COMPANIONS MAY COME TO RUIN BUT THERE IS A FRIEND WHO STICKS CLOSER THAN A BROTHER

BETTER IS A POOR PERSON WHO WALKS IN HIS INTEGRITY THAN ONE WHO IS CROOKED IN SPEECH AND IS A FOOL

DESIRE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT GOOD AND WHOEVER MAKES HASTE WITH HIS FEET MISSES HIS WAY

WHEN A MAN'S FOLLY BRINGS HIS WAY TO RUIN HIS HEART RAGES AGAINST THE LORD

WEALTH BRINGS MANY NEW FRIENDS BUT A POOR MAN IS DESERTED BY HIS FRIEND

A FALSE WITNESS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND HE WHO BREATHES OUT LIES WILL NOT ESCAPE

MANY SEEK THE FAVOR OF A GENEROUS MAN AND EVERYONE IS A FRIEND TO A MAN WHO GIVES GIFTS

ALL A POOR MAN'S BROTHERS HATE HIM; HOW MUCH MORE DO HIS FRIENDS GO FAR FROM HIM

HE PURSUES THEM WITH WORDS BUT DOES NOT HAVE THEM

WHOEVER GETS SENSE LOVES HIS OWN SOUL; HE WHO KEEPS UNDERSTANDING WILL DISCOVER GOOD

A FALSE WITNESS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND HE WHO BREATHES OUT LIES WILL PERISH

IT IS NOT FITTING FOR A FOOL TO LIVE IN LUXURY MUCH LESS FOR A SLAVE TO RULE OVER PRINCES

GOOD SENSE MAKES ONE SLOW TO ANGER AND IT IS HIS GLORY TO OVERLOOK AN OFFENSE

A KING'S WRATH IS LIKE THE GROWLING OF A LION BUT HIS FAVOR IS LIKE DEW ON THE GRASS

A FOOLISH SON IS RUIN TO HIS FATHER AND A WIFE'S QUARRELING IS A CONTINUAL DRIPPING OF RAIN

HOUSE AND WEALTH ARE INHERITED FROM FATHERS BUT A PRUDENT WIFE IS FROM THE LORD

SLOTHFULNESS CASTS INTO A DEEP SLEEP AND AN IDLE PERSON WILL SUFFER HUNGER

WHOEVER KEEPS THE COMMANDMENT KEEPS HIS LIFE; HE WHO DESPISES HIS WAYS WILL DIE

WHOEVER IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR LENDS TO THE LORD AND HE WILL REPAY HIM FOR HIS DEED

DISCIPLINE YOUR SON FOR THERE IS HOPE; DO NOT SET YOUR HEART ON PUTTING HIM TO DEATH

A MAN OF GREAT WRATH WILL PAY THE PENALTY FOR IF YOU DELIVER HIM YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN

LISTEN TO ADVICE AND ACCEPT INSTRUCTION THAT YOU MAY GAIN WISDOM IN THE FUTURE

MANY ARE THE PLANS IN THE MIND OF A MAN BUT IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LORD THAT WILL STAND

WHAT IS DESIRED IN A MAN IS STEADFAST LOVE AND A POOR MAN IS BETTER THAN A LIAR

THE FEAR OF THE LORD LEADS TO LIFE AND WHOEVER HAS IT RESTS SATISFIED; HE WILL NOT BE VISITED BY HARM

THE SLUGGARD BURIES HIS HAND IN THE DISH AND WILL NOT EVEN BRING IT BACK TO HIS MOUTH

STRIKE A SCOFFER AND THE SIMPLE WILL LEARN PRUDENCE; REPROVE A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING AND HE WILL GAIN KNOWLEDGE

HE WHO DOES VIOLENCE TO HIS FATHER AND CHASES AWAY HIS MOTHER IS A SON WHO BRINGS SHAME AND REPROACH

CEASE TO HEAR INSTRUCTION MY SON AND YOU WILL STRAY FROM THE WORDS OF KNOWLEDGE

A WORTHLESS WITNESS MOCKS AT JUSTICE AND THE MOUTH OF THE WICKED DEVOURS INIQUITY

CONDEMNATION IS READY FOR SCOFFERS AND BEATING FOR THE BACKS OF FOOLS

WINE IS A MOCKER STRONG DRINK A BRAWLER AND WHOEVER IS LED ASTRAY BY IT IS NOT WISE

THE TERROR OF A KING IS LIKE THE GROWLING OF A LION; WHOEVER PROVOKES HIM TO ANGER FORFEITS HIS LIFE

IT IS AN HONOR FOR A MAN TO KEEP ALOOF FROM STRIFE BUT EVERY FOOL WILL BE QUARRELING

THE SLUGGARD DOES NOT PLOW IN THE AUTUMN; HE WILL SEEK AT HARVEST AND HAVE NOTHING

THE PURPOSE IN A MAN'S HEART IS LIKE DEEP WATER BUT A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING WILL DRAW IT OUT

MANY A MAN PROCLAIMS HIS OWN STEADFAST LOVE BUT A FAITHFUL MAN WHO CAN FIND

THE RIGHTEOUS WHO WALKS IN HIS INTEGRITYBLESSED ARE HIS CHILDREN AFTER HIM

A KING WHO SITS ON THE THRONE OF JUDGMENT WINNOWS ALL EVIL WITH HIS EYES

WHO CAN SAY I HAVE MADE MY HEART PURE; I AM CLEAN FROM MY SIN

UNEQUAL WEIGHTS AND UNEQUAL MEASURES ARE BOTH ALIKE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD

EVEN A CHILD MAKES HIMSELF KNOWN BY HIS ACTS BY WHETHER HIS CONDUCT IS PURE AND UPRIGHT

THE HEARING EAR AND THE SEEING EYE THE LORD HAS MADE THEM BOTH

LOVE NOT SLEEP LEST YOU COME TO POVERTY; OPEN YOUR EYES AND YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BREAD

BAD BAD SAYS THE BUYER BUT WHEN HE GOES AWAY THEN HE BOASTS

THERE IS GOLD AND ABUNDANCE OF COSTLY STONES BUT THE LIPS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE A PRECIOUS JEWEL

TAKE A MAN'S GARMENT WHEN HE HAS PUT UP SECURITY FOR A STRANGER AND HOLD IT IN PLEDGE WHEN HE PUTS UP SECURITY FOR FOREIGNERS

BREAD GAINED BY DECEIT IS SWEET TO A MAN BUT AFTERWARD HIS MOUTH WILL BE FULL OF GRAVEL

PLANS ARE ESTABLISHED BY COUNSEL; BY WISE GUIDANCE WAGE WAR

WHOEVER GOES ABOUT SLANDERING REVEALS SECRETS; THEREFORE DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH A SIMPLE BABBLER

IF ONE CURSES HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER HIS LAMP WILL BE PUT OUT IN UTTER DARKNESS

AN INHERITANCE GAINED HASTILY IN THE BEGINNING WILL NOT BE BLESSED IN THE END

DO NOT SAY I WILL REPAY EVIL; WAIT FOR THE LORD AND HE WILL DELIVER YOU

UNEQUAL WEIGHTS ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD AND FALSE SCALES ARE NOT GOOD

A MAN'S STEPS ARE FROM THE LORD; HOW THEN CAN MAN UNDERSTAND HIS WAY

IT IS A SNARE TO SAY RASHLY IT IS HOLY AND TO REFLECT ONLY AFTER MAKING VOWS

A WISE KING WINNOWS THE WICKED AND DRIVES THE WHEEL OVER THEM

THE SPIRIT OF MAN IS THE LAMP OF THE LORD SEARCHING ALL HIS INNERMOST PARTS

STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS PRESERVE THE KING AND BY STEADFAST LOVE HIS THRONE IS UPHELD

THE GLORY OF YOUNG MEN IS THEIR STRENGTH BUT THE SPLENDOR OF OLD MEN IS THEIR GRAY HAIR

BLOWS THAT WOUND CLEANSE AWAY EVIL; STROKES MAKE CLEAN THE INNERMOST PARTS

THE KING'S HEART IS A STREAM OF WATER IN THE HAND OF THE LORD; HE TURNS IT WHEREVER HE WILL

EVERY WAY OF A MAN IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES BUT THE LORD WEIGHS THE HEART

TO DO RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE IS MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE LORD THAN SACRIFICE

HAUGHTY EYES AND A PROUD HEART THE LAMP OF THE WICKED ARE SIN

THE PLANS OF THE DILIGENT LEAD SURELY TO ABUNDANCE BUT EVERYONE WHO IS HASTY COMES ONLY TO POVERTY

THE GETTING OF TREASURES BY A LYING TONGUE IS A FLEETING VAPOR AND A SNARE OF DEATH

THE VIOLENCE OF THE WICKED WILL SWEEP THEM AWAY BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO DO WHAT IS JUST

THE WAY OF THE GUILTY IS CROOKED BUT THE CONDUCT OF THE PURE IS UPRIGHT

IT IS BETTER TO LIVE IN A CORNER OF THE HOUSETOP THAN IN A HOUSE SHARED WITH A QUARRELSOME WIFE

THE SOUL OF THE WICKED DESIRES EVIL; HIS NEIGHBOR FINDS NO MERCY IN HIS EYES

WHEN A SCOFFER IS PUNISHED THE SIMPLE BECOMES WISE; WHEN A WISE MAN IS INSTRUCTED HE GAINS KNOWLEDGE

THE RIGHTEOUS ONE OBSERVES THE HOUSE OF THE WICKED; HE THROWS THE WICKED DOWN TO RUIN

WHOEVER CLOSES HIS EAR TO THE CRY OF THE POOR WILL HIMSELF CALL OUT AND NOT BE ANSWERED

A GIFT IN SECRET AVERTS ANGER AND A CONCEALED BRIBE STRONG WRATH

WHEN JUSTICE IS DONE IT IS A JOY TO THE RIGHTEOUS BUT TERROR TO EVILDOERS

ONE WHO WANDERS FROM THE WAY OF GOOD SENSE WILL REST IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE DEAD

WHOEVER LOVES PLEASURE WILL BE A POOR MAN; HE WHO LOVES WINE AND OIL WILL NOT BE RICH

THE WICKED IS A RANSOM FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE TRAITOR FOR THE UPRIGHT

IT IS BETTER TO LIVE IN A DESERT LAND THAN WITH A QUARRELSOME AND FRETFUL WOMAN

PRECIOUS TREASURE AND OIL ARE IN A WISE MAN'S DWELLING BUT A FOOLISH MAN DEVOURS IT

WHOEVER PURSUES RIGHTEOUSNESS AND KINDNESS WILL FIND LIFE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HONOR

A WISE MAN SCALES THE CITY OF THE MIGHTY AND BRINGS DOWN THE STRONGHOLD IN WHICH THEY TRUST

WHOEVER KEEPS HIS MOUTH AND HIS TONGUE KEEPS HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE

SCOFFER IS THE NAME OF THE ARROGANT HAUGHTY MAN WHO ACTS WITH ARROGANT PRIDE

THE DESIRE OF THE SLUGGARD KILLS HIM FOR HIS HANDS REFUSE TO LABOR

ALL DAY LONG HE CRAVES AND CRAVES BUT THE RIGHTEOUS GIVES AND DOES NOT HOLD BACK

THE SACRIFICE OF THE WICKED IS AN ABOMINATION; HOW MUCH MORE WHEN HE BRINGS IT WITH EVIL INTENT

A FALSE WITNESS WILL PERISH BUT THE WORD OF A MAN WHO HEARS WILL ENDURE

A WICKED MAN PUTS ON A BOLD FACE BUT THE UPRIGHT GIVES THOUGHT TO HIS WAYS

NO WISDOM NO UNDERSTANDING NO COUNSEL CAN AVAIL AGAINST THE LORD

THE HORSE IS MADE READY FOR THE DAY OF BATTLE BUT THE VICTORY BELONGS TO THE LORD

A GOOD NAME IS TO BE CHOSEN RATHER THAN GREAT RICHES AND FAVOR IS BETTER THAN SILVER OR GOLD

THE RICH AND THE POOR MEET TOGETHER; THE LORD IS THE MAKER OF THEM ALL

THE PRUDENT SEES DANGER AND HIDES HIMSELF BUT THE SIMPLE GO ON AND SUFFER FOR IT

THE REWARD FOR HUMILITY AND FEAR OF THE LORD IS RICHES AND HONOR AND LIFE

THORNS AND SNARES ARE IN THE WAY OF THE CROOKED; WHOEVER GUARDS HIS SOUL WILL KEEP FAR FROM THEM

TRAIN UP A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO; EVEN WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT

THE RICH RULES OVER THE POOR AND THE BORROWER IS THE SLAVE OF THE LENDER

WHOEVER SOWS INJUSTICE WILL REAP CALAMITY AND THE ROD OF HIS FURY WILL FAIL

WHOEVER HAS A BOUNTIFUL EYE WILL BE BLESSED FOR HE SHARES HIS BREAD WITH THE POOR

DRIVE OUT A SCOFFER AND STRIFE WILL GO OUT AND QUARRELING AND ABUSE WILL CEASE

HE WHO LOVES PURITY OF HEART AND WHOSE SPEECH IS GRACIOUS WILL HAVE THE KING AS HIS FRIEND

THE EYES OF THE LORD KEEP WATCH OVER KNOWLEDGE BUT HE OVERTHROWS THE WORDS OF THE TRAITOR

THE SLUGGARD SAYS THERE IS A LION OUTSIDE

I SHALL BE KILLED IN THE STREETS

 THE MOUTH OF FORBIDDEN WOMEN IS A DEEP PIT; HE WITH WHOM THE LORD IS ANGRY WILL FALL INTO IT

FOLLY IS BOUND UP IN THE HEART OF A CHILD BUT THE ROD OF DISCIPLINE DRIVES IT FAR FROM HIM

WHOEVER OPPRESSES THE POOR TO INCREASE HIS OWN WEALTH OR GIVES TO THE RICH WILL ONLY COME TO POVERTY

INCLINE YOUR EAR AND HEAR THE WORDS OF THE WISE AND APPLY YOUR HEART TO MY KNOWLEDGE FOR IT WILL BE PLEASANT IF YOU KEEP THEM WITHIN YOU IF ALL OF THEM ARE READY ON YOUR LIPS

THAT YOUR TRUST MAY BE IN THE LORD I HAVE MADE THEM KNOWN TO YOU TODAY EVEN TO YOU

HAVE I NOT WRITTEN FOR YOU THIRTY SAYINGS OF COUNSEL AND KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE YOU KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND TRUE THAT YOU MAY GIVE A TRUE ANSWER TO THOSE WHO SENT YOU

DO NOT ROB THE POOR BECAUSE HE IS POOR OR CRUSH THE AFFLICTED AT THE GATE FOR THE LORD WILL PLEAD THEIR CAUSE AND ROB OF LIFE THOSE WHO ROB THEM

MAKE NO FRIENDSHIP WITH A MAN GIVEN TO ANGER NOR GO WITH A WRATHFUL MAN LEST YOU LEARN HIS WAYS AND ENTANGLE YOURSELF IN A SNARE

BE NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO GIVE PLEDGES WHO PUT UP SECURITY FOR DEBTS

IF YOU HAVE NOTHING WITH WHICH TO PAY WHY SHOULD YOUR BED BE TAKEN FROM UNDER YOU

DO NOT MOVE THE ANCIENT LANDMARK THAT YOUR FATHERS HAVE SET

DO YOU SEE A MAN SKILLFUL IN HIS WORK

HE WILL STAND BEFORE KINGS; HE WILL NOT STAND BEFORE OBSCURE MEN

WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO EAT WITH A RULER OBSERVE CAREFULLY WHAT IS BEFORE YOU AND PUT A KNIFE TO YOUR THROAT IF YOU ARE GIVEN TO APPETITE

DO NOT DESIRE HIS DELICACIES FOR THEY ARE DECEPTIVE FOOD

DO NOT TOIL TO ACQUIRE WEALTH; BE DISCERNING ENOUGH TO DESIST

WHEN YOUR EYES LIGHT ON IT IT IS GONE FOR SUDDENLY IT SPROUTS WINGS FLYING LIKE AN EAGLE TOWARD HEAVEN

DO NOT EAT THE BREAD OF A MAN WHO IS STINGY; DO NOT DESIRE HIS DELICACIES FOR HE IS LIKE ONE WHO IS INWARDLY CALCULATING

EAT AND DRINK

 HE SAYS TO YOU BUT HIS HEART IS NOT WITH YOU

YOU WILL VOMIT UP THE MORSELS THAT YOU HAVE EATEN AND WASTE YOUR PLEASANT WORDS

DO NOT SPEAK IN THE HEARING OF A FOOL FOR HE WILL DESPISE THE GOOD SENSE OF YOUR WORDS

DO NOT MOVE AN ANCIENT LANDMARK OR ENTER THE FIELDS OF THE FATHERLESS FOR THEIR REDEEMER IS STRONG; HE WILL PLEAD THEIR CAUSE AGAINST YOU

APPLY YOUR HEART TO INSTRUCTION AND YOUR EAR TO WORDS OF KNOWLEDGE

DO NOT WITHHOLD DISCIPLINE FROM A CHILD; IF YOU STRIKE HIM WITH A ROD HE WILL NOT DIE

IF YOU STRIKE HIM WITH THE ROD YOU WILL SAVE HIS SOUL FROM SHEOL

MY SON IF YOUR HEART IS WISE MY HEART TOO WILL BE GLAD

MY INMOST BEING WILL EXULT WHEN YOUR LIPS SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT

LET NOT YOUR HEART ENVY SINNERS BUT CONTINUE IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD ALL THE DAY

SURELY THERE IS A FUTURE AND YOUR HOPE WILL NOT BE CUT OFF

HEAR MY SON AND BE WISE AND DIRECT YOUR HEART IN THE WAY

BE NOT AMONG DRUNKARDS OR AMONG GLUTTONOUS EATERS OF MEAT FOR THE DRUNKARD AND THE GLUTTON WILL COME TO POVERTY AND SLUMBER WILL CLOTHE THEM WITH RAGS

LISTEN TO YOUR FATHER WHO GAVE YOU LIFE AND DO NOT DESPISE YOUR MOTHER WHEN SHE IS OLD

BUY TRUTH AND DO NOT SELL IT; BUY WISDOM INSTRUCTION AND UNDERSTANDING

THE FATHER OF THE RIGHTEOUS WILL GREATLY REJOICE; HE WHO FATHERS A WISE SON WILL BE GLAD IN HIM

LET YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER BE GLAD; LET HER WHO BORE YOU REJOICE

MY SON GIVE ME YOUR HEART AND LET YOUR EYES OBSERVE MY WAYS

FOR A PROSTITUTE IS A DEEP PIT; AN ADULTERESS IS A NARROW WELL

SHE LIES IN WAIT LIKE A ROBBER AND INCREASES THE TRAITORS AMONG MANKIND

WHO HAS WOE

WHO HAS SORROW

WHO HAS STRIFE

WHO HAS COMPLAINING

WHO HAS WOUNDS WITHOUT CAUSE

WHO HAS REDNESS OF EYES

THOSE WHO TARRY LONG OVER WINE; THOSE WHO GO TO TRY MIXED WINE

DO NOT LOOK AT WINE WHEN IT IS RED WHEN IT SPARKLES IN THE CUP AND GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY

IN THE END IT BITES LIKE A SERPENT AND STINGS LIKE AN ADDER

YOUR EYES WILL SEE STRANGE THINGS AND YOUR HEART UTTER PERVERSE THINGS

YOU WILL BE LIKE ONE WHO LIES DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA LIKE ONE WHO LIES ON THE TOP OF A MAST

THEY STRUCK ME YOU WILL SAY BUT I WAS NOT HURT; THEY BEAT ME BUT I DID NOT FEEL IT

WHEN SHALL I AWAKE

I MUST HAVE ANOTHER DRINK

BE NOT ENVIOUS OF EVIL MEN NOR DESIRE TO BE WITH THEM FOR THEIR HEARTS DEVISE VIOLENCE AND THEIR LIPS TALK OF TROUBLE

BY WISDOM A HOUSE IS BUILT AND BY UNDERSTANDING IT IS ESTABLISHED; BY KNOWLEDGE THE ROOMS ARE FILLED WITH ALL PRECIOUS AND PLEASANT RICHES

A WISE MAN IS FULL OF STRENGTH AND A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE ENHANCES HIS MIGHT FOR BY WISE GUIDANCE YOU CAN WAGE YOUR WAR AND IN ABUNDANCE OF COUNSELORS THERE IS VICTORY

WISDOM IS TOO HIGH FOR A FOOL; IN THE GATE HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH

WHOEVER PLANS TO DO EVIL WILL BE CALLED A SCHEMER

THE DEVISING OF FOLLY IS SIN AND THE SCOFFER IS AN ABOMINATION TO MANKIND

IF YOU FAINT IN THE DAY OF ADVERSITY YOUR STRENGTH IS SMALL

RESCUE THOSE WHO ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY TO DEATH; HOLD BACK THOSE WHO ARE STUMBLING TO THE SLAUGHTER

IF YOU SAY BEHOLD WE DID NOT KNOW THIS DOES NOT HE WHO WEIGHS THE HEART PERCEIVE IT

DOES NOT HE WHO KEEPS WATCH OVER YOUR SOUL KNOW IT AND WILL HE NOT REPAY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS WORK

MY SON EAT HONEY FOR IT IS GOOD AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE HONEYCOMB ARE SWEET TO YOUR TASTE

KNOW THAT WISDOM IS SUCH TO YOUR SOUL; IF YOU FIND IT THERE WILL BE A FUTURE AND YOUR HOPE WILL NOT BE CUT OFF

LIE NOT IN WAIT AS A WICKED MAN AGAINST THE DWELLING OF THE RIGHTEOUS; DO NO VIOLENCE TO HIS HOME; FOR THE RIGHTEOUS FALLS SEVEN TIMES AND RISES AGAIN BUT THE WICKED STUMBLE IN TIMES OF CALAMITY

DO NOT REJOICE WHEN YOUR ENEMY FALLS AND LET NOT YOUR HEART BE GLAD WHEN HE STUMBLES LEST THE LORD SEE IT AND BE DISPLEASED AND TURN AWAY HIS ANGER FROM HIM

FRET NOT YOURSELF BECAUSE OF EVILDOERS AND BE NOT ENVIOUS OF THE WICKED FOR THE EVIL MAN HAS NO FUTURE; THE LAMP OF THE WICKED WILL BE PUT OUT

MY SON FEAR THE LORD AND THE KING AND DO NOT JOIN WITH THOSE WHO DO OTHERWISE FOR DISASTER FROM THEM WILL RISE SUDDENLY AND WHO KNOWS THE RUIN THAT WILL COME FROM THEM BOTH

THESE ALSO ARE SAYINGS OF THE WISE

PARTIALITY IN JUDGING IS NOT GOOD

WHOEVER SAYS TO THE WICKED YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT WILL BE CURSED BY PEOPLES ABHORRED BY NATIONS BUT THOSE WHO REBUKE THE WICKED WILL HAVE DELIGHT AND A GOOD BLESSING WILL COME UPON THEM

WHOEVER GIVES AN HONEST ANSWER KISSES THE LIPS

PREPARE YOUR WORK OUTSIDE; GET EVERYTHING READY FOR YOURSELF IN THE FIELD AND AFTER THAT BUILD YOUR HOUSE

BE NOT A WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR WITHOUT CAUSE AND DO NOT DECEIVE WITH YOUR LIPS

DO NOT SAY I WILL DO TO HIM AS HE HAS DONE TO ME; I WILL PAY THE MAN BACK FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE

 I PASSED BY THE FIELD OF A SLUGGARD BY THE VINEYARD OF A MAN LACKING SENSE AND BEHOLD IT WAS ALL OVERGROWN WITH THORNS; THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH NETTLES AND ITS STONE WALL WAS BROKEN DOWN

THEN I SAW AND CONSIDERED IT; I LOOKED AND RECEIVED INSTRUCTION

A LITTLE SLEEP A LITTLE SLUMBER A LITTLE FOLDING OF THE HANDS TO REST AND POVERTY WILL COME UPON YOU LIKE A ROBBER AND WANT LIKE AN ARMED MAN

THESE ALSO ARE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON WHICH THE MEN OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH COPIED

IT IS THE GLORY OF GOD TO CONCEAL THINGS BUT THE GLORY OF KINGS IS TO SEARCH THINGS OUT

AS THE HEAVENS FOR HEIGHT AND THE EARTH FOR DEPTH SO THE HEART OF KINGS IS UNSEARCHABLE

TAKE AWAY THE DROSS FROM THE SILVER AND THE SMITH HAS MATERIAL FOR A VESSEL; TAKE AWAY THE WICKED FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE KING AND HIS THRONE WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

DO NOT PUT YOURSELF FORWARD IN THE KING'S PRESENCE OR STAND IN THE PLACE OF THE GREAT FOR IT IS BETTER TO BE TOLD COME UP HERE THAN TO BE PUT LOWER IN THE PRESENCE OF A NOBLE

WHAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN DO NOT HASTILY BRING INTO COURT FOR WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE END WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOR PUTS YOU TO SHAME

ARGUE YOUR CASE WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR HIMSELF AND DO NOT REVEAL ANOTHER'S SECRET LEST HE WHO HEARS YOU BRING SHAME UPON YOU AND YOUR ILL REPUTE HAVE NO END

A WORD FITLY SPOKEN IS LIKE APPLES OF GOLD IN A SETTING OF SILVER

LIKE A GOLD RING OR AN ORNAMENT OF GOLD IS A WISE REPROVER TO A LISTENING EAR

LIKE THE COLD OF SNOW IN THE TIME OF HARVEST IS A FAITHFUL MESSENGER TO THOSE WHO SEND HIM; HE REFRESHES THE SOUL OF HIS MASTERS

LIKE CLOUDS AND WIND WITHOUT RAIN IS A MAN WHO BOASTS OF A GIFT HE DOES NOT GIVE

WITH PATIENCE A RULER MAY BE PERSUADED AND A SOFT TONGUE WILL BREAK A BONE

IF YOU HAVE FOUND HONEY EAT ONLY ENOUGH FOR YOU LEST YOU HAVE YOUR FILL OF IT AND VOMIT IT

LET YOUR FOOT BE SELDOM IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE LEST HE HAVE HIS FILL OF YOU AND HATE YOU

A MAN WHO BEARS FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR IS LIKE A WAR CLUB OR A SWORD OR A SHARP ARROW

TRUSTING IN A TREACHEROUS MAN IN TIME OF TROUBLE IS LIKE A BAD TOOTH OR A FOOT THAT SLIPS

WHOEVER SINGS SONGS TO A HEAVY HEART IS LIKE ONE WHO TAKES OFF A GARMENT ON A COLD DAY AND LIKE VINEGAR ON SODA

IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY GIVE HIM BREAD TO EAT AND IF HE IS THIRSTY GIVE HIM WATER TO DRINK FOR YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD AND THE LORD WILL REWARD YOU

THE NORTH WIND BRINGS FORTH RAIN AND A BACKBITING TONGUE ANGRY LOOKS

IT IS BETTER TO LIVE IN A CORNER OF THE HOUSETOP THAN IN A HOUSE SHARED WITH A QUARRELSOME WIFE

LIKE COLD WATER TO A THIRSTY SOUL SO IS GOOD NEWS FROM A FAR COUNTRY

LIKE A MUDDIED SPRING OR A POLLUTED FOUNTAIN IS A RIGHTEOUS MAN WHO GIVES WAY BEFORE THE WICKED

IT IS NOT GOOD TO EAT MUCH HONEY NOR IS IT GLORIOUS TO SEEK ONE'S OWN GLORY

A MAN WITHOUT SELFCONTROL IS LIKE A CITY BROKEN INTO AND LEFT WITHOUT WALLS

LIKE SNOW IN SUMMER OR RAIN IN HARVEST SO HONOR IS NOT FITTING FOR A FOOL

LIKE A SPARROW IN ITS FLITTING LIKE A SWALLOW IN ITS FLYING A CURSE THAT IS CAUSELESS DOES NOT ALIGHT

A WHIP FOR THE HORSE A BRIDLE FOR THE DONKEY AND A ROD FOR THE BACK OF FOOLS

ANSWER NOT A FOOL ACCORDING TO HIS FOLLY LEST YOU BE LIKE HIM YOURSELF

ANSWER A FOOL ACCORDING TO HIS FOLLY LEST HE BE WISE IN HIS OWN EYES

WHOEVER SENDS A MESSAGE BY THE HAND OF A FOOL CUTS OFF HIS OWN FEET AND DRINKS VIOLENCE

LIKE A LAME MAN'S LEGS WHICH HANG USELESS IS A PROVERB IN THE MOUTH OF FOOLS

LIKE ONE WHO BINDS THE STONE IN THE SLING IS ONE WHO GIVES HONOR TO A FOOL

LIKE A THORN THAT GOES UP INTO THE HAND OF A DRUNKARD IS A PROVERB IN THE MOUTH OF FOOLS

LIKE AN ARCHER WHO WOUNDS EVERYONE IS ONE WHO HIRES A PASSING FOOL OR DRUNKARD

LIKE A DOG THAT RETURNS TO HIS VOMIT IS A FOOL WHO REPEATS HIS FOLLY

DO YOU SEE A MAN WHO IS WISE IN HIS OWN EYES

THERE IS MORE HOPE FOR A FOOL THAN FOR HIM

THE SLUGGARD SAYS THERE IS A LION IN THE ROAD

THERE IS A LION IN THE STREETS

 AS A DOOR TURNS ON ITS HINGES SO DOES A SLUGGARD ON HIS BED

THE SLUGGARD BURIES HIS HAND IN THE DISH; IT WEARS HIM OUT TO BRING IT BACK TO HIS MOUTH

THE SLUGGARD IS WISER IN HIS OWN EYES THAN SEVEN MEN WHO CAN ANSWER SENSIBLY

WHOEVER MEDDLES IN A QUARREL NOT HIS OWN IS LIKE ONE WHO TAKES A PASSING DOG BY THE EARS

LIKE A MADMAN WHO THROWS FIREBRANDS ARROWS AND DEATH IS THE MAN WHO DECEIVES HIS NEIGHBOR AND SAYS I AM ONLY JOKING

 FOR LACK OF WOOD THE FIRE GOES OUT AND WHERE THERE IS NO WHISPERER QUARRELING CEASES

AS CHARCOAL TO HOT EMBERS AND WOOD TO FIRE SO IS A QUARRELSOME MAN FOR KINDLING STRIFE

THE WORDS OF A WHISPERER ARE LIKE DELICIOUS MORSELS; THEY GO DOWN INTO THE INNER PARTS OF THE BODY

LIKE THE GLAZE COVERING AN EARTHEN VESSEL ARE FERVENT LIPS WITH AN EVIL HEART

WHOEVER HATES DISGUISES HIMSELF WITH HIS LIPS AND HARBORS DECEIT IN HIS HEART; WHEN HE SPEAKS GRACIOUSLY BELIEVE HIM NOT FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART; THOUGH HIS HATRED BE COVERED WITH DECEPTION HIS WICKEDNESS WILL BE EXPOSED IN THE ASSEMBLY

WHOEVER DIGS A PIT WILL FALL INTO IT AND A STONE WILL COME BACK ON HIM WHO STARTS IT ROLLING

A LYING TONGUE HATES ITS VICTIMS AND A FLATTERING MOUTH WORKS RUIN

DO NOT BOAST ABOUT TOMORROW FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT A DAY MAY BRING

LET ANOTHER PRAISE YOU AND NOT YOUR OWN MOUTH; A STRANGER AND NOT YOUR OWN LIPS

A STONE IS HEAVY AND SAND IS WEIGHTY BUT A FOOL'S PROVOCATION IS HEAVIER THAN BOTH

WRATH IS CRUEL ANGER IS OVERWHELMING BUT WHO CAN STAND BEFORE JEALOUSY

BETTER IS OPEN REBUKE THAN HIDDEN LOVE

FAITHFUL ARE THE WOUNDS OF A FRIEND; PROFUSE ARE THE KISSES OF AN ENEMY

ONE WHO IS FULL LOATHES HONEY BUT TO ONE WHO IS HUNGRY EVERYTHING BITTER IS SWEET

LIKE A BIRD THAT STRAYS FROM ITS NEST IS A MAN WHO STRAYS FROM HIS HOME

OIL AND PERFUME MAKE THE HEART GLAD AND THE SWEETNESS OF A FRIEND COMES FROM HIS EARNEST COUNSEL

DO NOT FORSAKE YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND AND DO NOT GO TO YOUR BROTHER'S HOUSE IN THE DAY OF YOUR CALAMITY

BETTER IS A NEIGHBOR WHO IS NEAR THAN A BROTHER WHO IS FAR AWAY

BE WISE MY SON AND MAKE MY HEART GLAD THAT I MAY ANSWER HIM WHO REPROACHES ME

THE PRUDENT SEES DANGER AND HIDES HIMSELF BUT THE SIMPLE GO ON AND SUFFER FOR IT

TAKE A MAN'S GARMENT WHEN HE HAS PUT UP SECURITY FOR A STRANGER AND HOLD IT IN PLEDGE WHEN HE PUTS UP SECURITY FOR AN ADULTERESS

WHOEVER BLESSES HIS NEIGHBOR WITH A LOUD VOICE RISING EARLY IN THE MORNING WILL BE COUNTED AS CURSING

A CONTINUAL DRIPPING ON A RAINY DAY AND A QUARRELSOME WIFE ARE ALIKE; TO RESTRAIN HER IS TO RESTRAIN THE WIND OR TO GRASP OIL IN ONE'S RIGHT HAND

IRON SHARPENS IRON AND ONE MAN SHARPENS ANOTHER

WHOEVER TENDS A FIG TREE WILL EAT ITS FRUIT AND HE WHO GUARDS HIS MASTER WILL BE HONORED

AS IN WATER FACE REFLECTS FACE SO THE HEART OF MAN REFLECTS THE MAN

SHEOL AND ABADDON ARE NEVER SATISFIED AND NEVER SATISFIED ARE THE EYES OF MAN

THE CRUCIBLE IS FOR SILVER AND THE FURNACE IS FOR GOLD AND A MAN IS TESTED BY HIS PRAISE

CRUSH A FOOL IN A MORTAR WITH A PESTLE ALONG WITH CRUSHED GRAIN YET HIS FOLLY WILL NOT DEPART FROM HIM

KNOW WELL THE CONDITION OF YOUR FLOCKS AND GIVE ATTENTION TO YOUR HERDS FOR RICHES DO NOT LAST FOREVER; AND DOES A CROWN ENDURE TO ALL GENERATIONS

WHEN THE GRASS IS GONE AND THE NEW GROWTH APPEARS AND THE VEGETATION OF THE MOUNTAINS IS GATHERED THE LAMBS WILL PROVIDE YOUR CLOTHING AND THE GOATS THE PRICE OF A FIELD

THERE WILL BE ENOUGH GOATS' MILK FOR YOUR FOOD FOR THE FOOD OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND MAINTENANCE FOR YOUR GIRLS

THE WICKED FLEE WHEN NO ONE PURSUES BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION

WHEN A LAND TRANSGRESSES IT HAS MANY RULERS BUT WITH A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE ITS STABILITY WILL LONG CONTINUE

A POOR MAN WHO OPPRESSES THE POOR IS A BEATING RAIN THAT LEAVES NO FOOD

THOSE WHO FORSAKE THE LAW PRAISE THE WICKED BUT THOSE WHO KEEP THE LAW STRIVE AGAINST THEM

EVIL MEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUSTICE BUT THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY

BETTER IS A POOR MAN WHO WALKS IN HIS INTEGRITY THAN A RICH MAN WHO IS CROOKED IN HIS WAYS

THE ONE WHO KEEPS THE LAW IS A SON WITH UNDERSTANDING BUT A COMPANION OF GLUTTONS SHAMES HIS FATHER

WHOEVER MULTIPLIES HIS WEALTH BY INTEREST AND PROFIT GATHERS IT FOR HIM WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR

IF ONE TURNS AWAY HIS EAR FROM HEARING THE LAW EVEN HIS PRAYER IS AN ABOMINATION

WHOEVER MISLEADS THE UPRIGHT INTO AN EVIL WAY WILL FALL INTO HIS OWN PIT BUT THE BLAMELESS WILL HAVE A GOODLY INHERITANCE

A RICH MAN IS WISE IN HIS OWN EYES BUT A POOR MAN WHO HAS UNDERSTANDING WILL FIND HIM OUT

WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS TRIUMPH THERE IS GREAT GLORY BUT WHEN THE WICKED RISE PEOPLE HIDE THEMSELVES

WHOEVER CONCEALS HIS TRANSGRESSIONS WILL NOT PROSPER BUT HE WHO CONFESSES AND FORSAKES THEM WILL OBTAIN MERCY

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO FEARS THE LORD ALWAYS BUT WHOEVER HARDENS HIS HEART WILL FALL INTO CALAMITY

LIKE A ROARING LION OR A CHARGING BEAR IS A WICKED RULER OVER A POOR PEOPLE

A RULER WHO LACKS UNDERSTANDING IS A CRUEL OPPRESSOR BUT HE WHO HATES UNJUST GAIN WILL PROLONG HIS DAYS

IF ONE IS BURDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF ANOTHER HE WILL BE A FUGITIVE UNTIL DEATH; LET NO ONE HELP HIM

WHOEVER WALKS IN INTEGRITY WILL BE DELIVERED BUT HE WHO IS CROOKED IN HIS WAYS WILL SUDDENLY FALL

WHOEVER WORKS HIS LAND WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BREAD BUT HE WHO FOLLOWS WORTHLESS PURSUITS WILL HAVE PLENTY OF POVERTY

A FAITHFUL MAN WILL ABOUND WITH BLESSINGS BUT WHOEVER HASTENS TO BE RICH WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED

TO SHOW PARTIALITY IS NOT GOOD BUT FOR A PIECE OF BREAD A MAN WILL DO WRONG

A STINGY MAN HASTENS AFTER WEALTH AND DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME UPON HIM

WHOEVER REBUKES A MAN WILL AFTERWARD FIND MORE FAVOR THAN HE WHO FLATTERS WITH HIS TONGUE

WHOEVER ROBS HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER AND SAYS THAT IS NO TRANSGRESSION IS A COMPANION TO A MAN WHO DESTROYS

A GREEDY MAN STIRS UP STRIFE BUT THE ONE WHO TRUSTS IN THE LORD WILL BE ENRICHED

WHOEVER TRUSTS IN HIS OWN MIND IS A FOOL BUT HE WHO WALKS IN WISDOM WILL BE DELIVERED

WHOEVER GIVES TO THE POOR WILL NOT WANT BUT HE WHO HIDES HIS EYES WILL GET MANY A CURSE

WHEN THE WICKED RISE PEOPLE HIDE THEMSELVES BUT WHEN THEY PERISH THE RIGHTEOUS INCREASE

HE WHO IS OFTEN REPROVED YET STIFFENS HIS NECK WILL SUDDENLY BE BROKEN BEYOND HEALING

WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS INCREASE THE PEOPLE REJOICE BUT WHEN THE WICKED RULE THE PEOPLE GROAN

HE WHO LOVES WISDOM MAKES HIS FATHER GLAD BUT A COMPANION OF PROSTITUTES SQUANDERS HIS WEALTH

BY JUSTICE A KING BUILDS UP THE LAND BUT HE WHO EXACTS GIFTS TEARS IT DOWN

A MAN WHO FLATTERS HIS NEIGHBOR SPREADS A NET FOR HIS FEET

AN EVIL MAN IS ENSNARED IN HIS TRANSGRESSION BUT A RIGHTEOUS MAN SINGS AND REJOICES

A RIGHTEOUS MAN KNOWS THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR; A WICKED MAN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH KNOWLEDGE

SCOFFERS SET A CITY AFLAME BUT THE WISE TURN AWAY WRATH

IF A WISE MAN HAS AN ARGUMENT WITH A FOOL THE FOOL ONLY RAGES AND LAUGHS AND THERE IS NO QUIET

BLOODTHIRSTY MEN HATE ONE WHO IS BLAMELESS AND SEEK THE LIFE OF THE UPRIGHT

A FOOL GIVES FULL VENT TO HIS SPIRIT BUT A WISE MAN QUIETLY HOLDS IT BACK

IF A RULER LISTENS TO FALSEHOOD ALL HIS OFFICIALS WILL BE WICKED

THE POOR MAN AND THE OPPRESSOR MEET TOGETHER; THE LORD GIVES LIGHT TO THE EYES OF BOTH

IF A KING FAITHFULLY JUDGES THE POOR HIS THRONE WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER

THE ROD AND REPROOF GIVE WISDOM BUT A CHILD LEFT TO HIMSELF BRINGS SHAME TO HIS MOTHER

WHEN THE WICKED INCREASE TRANSGRESSION INCREASES BUT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL LOOK UPON THEIR DOWNFALL

DISCIPLINE YOUR SON AND HE WILL GIVE YOU REST; HE WILL GIVE DELIGHT TO YOUR HEART

WHERE THERE IS NO PROPHETIC VISION THE PEOPLE CAST OFF RESTRAINT BUT BLESSED IS HE WHO KEEPS THE LAW

BY MERE WORDS A SERVANT IS NOT DISCIPLINED FOR THOUGH HE UNDERSTANDS HE WILL NOT RESPOND

DO YOU SEE A MAN WHO IS HASTY IN HIS WORDS

THERE IS MORE HOPE FOR A FOOL THAN FOR HIM

WHOEVER PAMPERS HIS SERVANT FROM CHILDHOOD WILL IN THE END FIND HIM HIS HEIR

A MAN OF WRATH STIRS UP STRIFE AND ONE GIVEN TO ANGER CAUSES MUCH TRANSGRESSION

ONE'S PRIDE WILL BRING HIM LOW BUT HE WHO IS LOWLY IN SPIRIT WILL OBTAIN HONOR

THE PARTNER OF A THIEF HATES HIS OWN LIFE; HE HEARS THE CURSE BUT DISCLOSES NOTHING

THE FEAR OF MAN LAYS A SNARE BUT WHOEVER TRUSTS IN THE LORD IS SAFE

MANY SEEK THE FACE OF A RULER BUT IT IS FROM THE LORD THAT A MAN GETS JUSTICE

AN UNJUST MAN IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE RIGHTEOUS BUT ONE WHOSE WAY IS STRAIGHT IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE WICKED

THE WORDS OF AGUR SON OF JAKEH

THE ORACLE

THE MAN DECLARES I AM WEARY O GOD; I AM WEARY O GOD AND WORN OUT

SURELY I AM TOO STUPID TO BE A MAN

I HAVE NOT THE UNDERSTANDING OF A MAN

I HAVE NOT LEARNED WISDOM NOR HAVE I KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLY ONE

WHO HAS ASCENDED TO HEAVEN AND COME DOWN

WHO HAS GATHERED THE WIND IN HIS FISTS

WHO HAS WRAPPED UP THE WATERS IN A GARMENT

WHO HAS ESTABLISHED ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

WHAT IS HIS NAME AND WHAT IS HIS SON'S NAME

SURELY YOU KNOW

EVERY WORD OF GOD PROVES TRUE; HE IS A SHIELD TO THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

DO NOT ADD TO HIS WORDS LEST HE REBUKE YOU AND YOU BE FOUND A LIAR

TWO THINGS I ASK OF YOU; DENY THEM NOT TO ME BEFORE I DIE REMOVE FAR FROM ME FALSEHOOD AND LYING; GIVE ME NEITHER POVERTY NOR RICHES; FEED ME WITH THE FOOD THAT IS NEEDFUL FOR ME LEST I BE FULL AND DENY YOU AND SAY WHO IS THE LORD

 OR LEST I BE POOR AND STEAL AND PROFANE THE NAME OF MY GOD

DO NOT SLANDER A SERVANT TO HIS MASTER LEST HE CURSE YOU AND YOU BE HELD GUILTY

THERE ARE THOSE WHO CURSE THEIR FATHERS AND DO NOT BLESS THEIR MOTHERS

THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE CLEAN IN THEIR OWN EYES BUT ARE NOT WASHED OF THEIR FILTH

THERE ARE THOSEHOW LOFTY ARE THEIR EYES HOW HIGH THEIR EYELIDS LIFT

THERE ARE THOSE WHOSE TEETH ARE SWORDS WHOSE FANGS ARE KNIVES TO DEVOUR THE POOR FROM OFF THE EARTH THE NEEDY FROM AMONG MANKIND

THE LEECH HAS TWO DAUGHTERS; GIVE AND GIVE THEY CRY

THREE THINGS ARE NEVER SATISFIED; FOUR NEVER SAY ENOUGH SHEOL THE BARREN WOMB THE LAND NEVER SATISFIED WITH WATER AND THE FIRE THAT NEVER SAYS ENOUGH

 THE EYE THAT MOCKS A FATHER AND SCORNS TO OBEY A MOTHER WILL BE PICKED OUT BY THE RAVENS OF THE VALLEY AND EATEN BY THE VULTURES

THREE THINGS ARE TOO WONDERFUL FOR ME; FOUR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WAY OF AN EAGLE IN THE SKY THE WAY OF A SERPENT ON A ROCK THE WAY OF A SHIP ON THE HIGH SEAS AND THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A VIRGIN

THIS IS THE WAY OF AN ADULTERESS SHE EATS AND WIPES HER MOUTH AND SAYS I HAVE DONE NO WRONG

 UNDER THREE THINGS THE EARTH TREMBLES; UNDER FOUR IT CANNOT BEAR UP A SLAVE WHEN HE BECOMES KING AND A FOOL WHEN HE IS FILLED WITH FOOD; AN UNLOVED WOMAN WHEN SHE GETS A HUSBAND AND A MAIDSERVANT WHEN SHE DISPLACES HER MISTRESS

FOUR THINGS ON EARTH ARE SMALL BUT THEY ARE EXCEEDINGLY WISE THE ANTS ARE A PEOPLE NOT STRONG YET THEY PROVIDE THEIR FOOD IN THE SUMMER; THE ROCK BADGERS ARE A PEOPLE NOT MIGHTY YET THEY MAKE THEIR HOMES IN THE CLIFFS; THE LOCUSTS HAVE NO KING YET ALL OF THEM MARCH IN RANK; THE LIZARD YOU CAN TAKE IN YOUR HANDS YET IT IS IN KINGS' PALACES

THREE THINGS ARE STATELY IN THEIR TREAD; FOUR ARE STATELY IN THEIR STRIDE THE LION WHICH IS MIGHTIEST AMONG BEASTS AND DOES NOT TURN BACK BEFORE ANY; THE STRUTTING ROOSTER THE HEGOAT AND A KING WHOSE ARMY IS WITH HIM

IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLISH EXALTING YOURSELF OR IF YOU HAVE BEEN DEVISING EVIL PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR MOUTH

FOR PRESSING MILK PRODUCES CURDS PRESSING THE NOSE PRODUCES BLOOD AND PRESSING ANGER PRODUCES STRIFE

THE WORDS OF KING LEMUEL

AN ORACLE THAT HIS MOTHER TAUGHT HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING MY SON

WHAT ARE YOU DOING SON OF MY WOMB

WHAT ARE YOU DOING SON OF MY VOWS

DO NOT GIVE YOUR STRENGTH TO WOMEN YOUR WAYS TO THOSE WHO DESTROY KINGS

IT IS NOT FOR KINGS O LEMUEL IT IS NOT FOR KINGS TO DRINK WINE OR FOR RULERS TO TAKE STRONG DRINK LEST THEY DRINK AND FORGET WHAT HAS BEEN DECREED AND PERVERT THE RIGHTS OF ALL THE AFFLICTED

GIVE STRONG DRINK TO THE ONE WHO IS PERISHING AND WINE TO THOSE IN BITTER DISTRESS; LET THEM DRINK AND FORGET THEIR POVERTY AND REMEMBER THEIR MISERY NO MORE

OPEN YOUR MOUTH FOR THE MUTE FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL WHO ARE DESTITUTE

OPEN YOUR MOUTH JUDGE RIGHTEOUSLY DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR AND NEEDY

AN EXCELLENT WIFE WHO CAN FIND

SHE IS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN JEWELS

THE HEART OF HER HUSBAND TRUSTS IN HER AND HE WILL HAVE NO LACK OF GAIN

SHE DOES HIM GOOD AND NOT HARM ALL THE DAYS OF HER LIFE

SHE SEEKS WOOL AND FLAX AND WORKS WITH WILLING HANDS

SHE IS LIKE THE SHIPS OF THE MERCHANT; SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR

SHE RISES WHILE IT IS YET NIGHT AND PROVIDES FOOD FOR HER HOUSEHOLD AND PORTIONS FOR HER MAIDENS

SHE CONSIDERS A FIELD AND BUYS IT; WITH THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS SHE PLANTS A VINEYARD

SHE DRESSES HERSELF WITH STRENGTH AND MAKES HER ARMS STRONG

SHE PERCEIVES THAT HER MERCHANDISE IS PROFITABLE

HER LAMP DOES NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT

SHE PUTS HER HANDS TO THE DISTAFF AND HER HANDS HOLD THE SPINDLE

SHE OPENS HER HAND TO THE POOR AND REACHES OUT HER HANDS TO THE NEEDY

SHE IS NOT AFRAID OF SNOW FOR HER HOUSEHOLD FOR ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED IN SCARLET

SHE MAKES BED COVERINGS FOR HERSELF; HER CLOTHING IS FINE LINEN AND PURPLE

HER HUSBAND IS KNOWN IN THE GATES WHEN HE SITS AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND

SHE MAKES LINEN GARMENTS AND SELLS THEM; SHE DELIVERS SASHES TO THE MERCHANT

STRENGTH AND DIGNITY ARE HER CLOTHING AND SHE LAUGHS AT THE TIME TO COME

SHE OPENS HER MOUTH WITH WISDOM AND THE TEACHING OF KINDNESS IS ON HER TONGUE

SHE LOOKS WELL TO THE WAYS OF HER HOUSEHOLD AND DOES NOT EAT THE BREAD OF IDLENESS

HER CHILDREN RISE UP AND CALL HER BLESSED; HER HUSBAND ALSO AND HE PRAISES HER MANY WOMEN HAVE DONE EXCELLENTLY BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL

 CHARM IS DECEITFUL AND BEAUTY IS VAIN BUT A WOMAN WHO FEARS THE LORD IS TO BE PRAISED

GIVE HER OF THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS AND LET HER WORKS PRAISE HER IN THE GATES

REVELATIONTHE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST WHICH GOD GAVE HIM TO SHOW TO HIS SERVANTS THE THINGS THAT MUST SOON TAKE PLACE

HE MADE IT KNOWN BY SENDING HIS ANGEL TO HIS SERVANT JOHN WHO BORE WITNESS TO THE WORD OF GOD AND TO THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST EVEN TO ALL THAT HE SAW

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO READS ALOUD THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY AND BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO HEAR AND WHO KEEP WHAT IS WRITTEN IN IT FOR THE TIME IS NEAR

JOHN TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES THAT ARE IN ASIAGRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM HIM WHO IS AND WHO WAS AND WHO IS TO COME AND FROM THE SEVEN SPIRITS WHO ARE BEFORE HIS THRONE AND FROM JESUS CHRIST THE FAITHFUL WITNESS THE FIRSTBORN OF THE DEAD AND THE RULER OF KINGS ON EARTH

TO HIM WHO LOVES US AND HAS FREED US FROM OUR SINS BY HIS BLOOD AND MADE US A KINGDOM PRIESTS TO HIS GOD AND FATHER TO HIM BE GLORY AND DOMINION FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

BEHOLD HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS AND EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM EVEN THOSE WHO PIERCED HIM AND ALL TRIBES OF THE EARTH WILL WAIL ON ACCOUNT OF HIM

EVEN SO

AMEN

I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA SAYS THE LORD GOD WHO IS AND WHO WAS AND WHO IS TO COME THE ALMIGHTY

 I JOHN YOUR BROTHER AND PARTNER IN THE TRIBULATION AND THE KINGDOM AND THE PATIENT ENDURANCE THAT ARE IN JESUS WAS ON THE ISLAND CALLED PATMOS ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD OF GOD AND THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS

I WAS IN THE SPIRIT ON THE LORD'S DAY AND I HEARD BEHIND ME A LOUD VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET SAYING WRITE WHAT YOU SEE IN A BOOK AND SEND IT TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES TO EPHESUS AND TO SMYRNA AND TO PERGAMUM AND TO THYATIRA AND TO SARDIS AND TO PHILADELPHIA AND TO LAODICEA

 THEN I TURNED TO SEE THE VOICE THAT WAS SPEAKING TO ME AND ON TURNING I SAW SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE LAMPSTANDS ONE LIKE A SON OF MAN CLOTHED WITH A LONG ROBE AND WITH A GOLDEN SASH AROUND HIS CHEST

THE HAIRS OF HIS HEAD WERE WHITE LIKE WOOL AS WHITE AS SNOW

HIS EYES WERE LIKE A FLAME OF FIRE HIS FEET WERE LIKE BURNISHED BRONZE REFINED IN A FURNACE AND HIS VOICE WAS LIKE THE ROAR OF MANY WATERS

IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HELD SEVEN STARS FROM HIS MOUTH CAME A SHARP TWOEDGED SWORD AND HIS FACE WAS LIKE THE SUN SHINING IN FULL STRENGTH

WHEN I SAW HIM I FELL AT HIS FEET AS THOUGH DEAD

BUT HE LAID HIS RIGHT HAND ON ME SAYING FEAR NOT I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST AND THE LIVING ONE

I DIED AND BEHOLD I AM ALIVE FOREVERMORE AND I HAVE THE KEYS OF DEATH AND HADES

WRITE THEREFORE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THOSE THAT ARE AND THOSE THAT ARE TO TAKE PLACE AFTER THIS

AS FOR THE MYSTERY OF THE SEVEN STARS THAT YOU SAW IN MY RIGHT HAND AND THE SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS THE SEVEN STARS ARE THE ANGELS OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES AND THE SEVEN LAMPSTANDS ARE THE SEVEN CHURCHES

IF ANYONE HEARS MY VOICE AND OPENS THE DOOR I WILL COME IN TO HIM AND EAT WITH HIM AND HE WITH ME

THE ONE WHO CONQUERS I WILL GRANT HIM TO SIT WITH ME ON MY THRONE AS I ALSO CONQUERED AND SAT DOWN WITH MY FATHER ON HIS THRONE

HE WHO HAS AN EAR LET HIM HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT SAYS TO THE CHURCHES

'AFTER THIS I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A DOOR STANDING OPEN IN HEAVEN

AND THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I HAD HEARD SPEAKING TO ME LIKE A TRUMPET SAID COME UP HERE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT MUST TAKE PLACE AFTER THIS

 AT ONCE I WAS IN THE SPIRIT AND BEHOLD A THRONE STOOD IN HEAVEN WITH ONE SEATED ON THE THRONE

AND HE WHO SAT THERE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF JASPER AND CARNELIAN AND AROUND THE THRONE WAS A RAINBOW THAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF AN EMERALD

AROUND THE THRONE WERE TWENTYFOUR THRONES AND SEATED ON THE THRONES WERE TWENTYFOUR ELDERS CLOTHED IN WHITE GARMENTS WITH GOLDEN CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS

FROM THE THRONE CAME FLASHES OF LIGHTNING AND RUMBLINGS AND PEALS OF THUNDER AND BEFORE THE THRONE WERE BURNING SEVEN TORCHES OF FIRE WHICH ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD AND BEFORE THE THRONE THERE WAS AS IT WERE A SEA OF GLASS LIKE CRYSTAL

AND AROUND THE THRONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE THRONE ARE FOUR LIVING CREATURES FULL OF EYES IN FRONT AND BEHIND THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE LIKE A LION THE SECOND LIVING CREATURE LIKE AN OX THE THIRD LIVING CREATURE WITH THE FACE OF A MAN AND THE FOURTH LIVING CREATURE LIKE AN EAGLE IN FLIGHT

AND THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES EACH OF THEM WITH SIX WINGS ARE FULL OF EYES ALL AROUND AND WITHIN AND DAY AND NIGHT THEY NEVER CEASE TO SAY HOLY HOLY HOLY IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO WAS AND IS AND IS TO COME

 AND WHENEVER THE LIVING CREATURES GIVE GLORY AND HONOR AND THANKS TO HIM WHO IS SEATED ON THE THRONE WHO LIVES FOREVER AND EVER THE TWENTYFOUR ELDERS FALL DOWN BEFORE HIM WHO IS SEATED ON THE THRONE AND WORSHIP HIM WHO LIVES FOREVER AND EVER

THEY CAST THEIR CROWNS BEFORE THE THRONE SAYING WORTHY ARE YOU OUR LORD AND GOD TO RECEIVE GLORY AND HONOR AND POWER FOR YOU CREATED ALL THINGS AND BY YOUR WILL THEY EXISTED AND WERE CREATED

THEN I SAW IN THE RIGHT HAND OF HIM WHO WAS SEATED ON THE THRONE A SCROLL WRITTEN WITHIN AND ON THE BACK SEALED WITH SEVEN SEALS

AND I SAW A STRONG ANGEL PROCLAIMING WITH A LOUD VOICE WHO IS WORTHY TO OPEN THE SCROLL AND BREAK ITS SEALS

 AND NO ONE IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTH OR UNDER THE EARTH WAS ABLE TO OPEN THE SCROLL OR TO LOOK INTO IT AND I BEGAN TO WEEP LOUDLY BECAUSE NO ONE WAS FOUND WORTHY TO OPEN THE SCROLL OR TO LOOK INTO IT

AND ONE OF THE ELDERS SAID TO ME WEEP NO MORE; BEHOLD THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH THE ROOT OF DAVID HAS CONQUERED SO THAT HE CAN OPEN THE SCROLL AND ITS SEVEN SEALS

 AND BETWEEN THE THRONE AND THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES AND AMONG THE ELDERS I SAW A LAMB STANDING AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SLAIN WITH SEVEN HORNS AND WITH SEVEN EYES WHICH ARE THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD SENT OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH

AND HE WENT AND TOOK THE SCROLL FROM THE RIGHT HAND OF HIM WHO WAS SEATED ON THE THRONE

AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE SCROLL THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES AND THE TWENTYFOUR ELDERS FELL DOWN BEFORE THE LAMB EACH HOLDING A HARP AND GOLDEN BOWLS FULL OF INCENSE WHICH ARE THE PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS

AND THEY SANG A NEW SONG SAYING WORTHY ARE YOU TO TAKE THE SCROLL AND TO OPEN ITS SEALS FOR YOU WERE SLAIN AND BY YOUR BLOOD YOU RANSOMED PEOPLE FOR GOD FROM EVERY TRIBE AND LANGUAGE AND PEOPLE AND NATION AND YOU HAVE MADE THEM A KINGDOM AND PRIESTS TO OUR GOD AND THEY SHALL REIGN ON THE EARTH

 THEN I LOOKED AND I HEARD AROUND THE THRONE AND THE LIVING CREATURES AND THE ELDERS THE VOICE OF MANY ANGELS NUMBERING MYRIADS OF MYRIADS AND THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS SAYING WITH A LOUD VOICE WORTHY IS THE LAMB WHO WAS SLAIN TO RECEIVE POWER AND WEALTH AND WISDOM AND MIGHT AND HONOR AND GLORY AND BLESSING

 AND I HEARD EVERY CREATURE IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH AND UNDER THE EARTH AND IN THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM SAYING TO HIM WHO SITS ON THE THRONE AND TO THE LAMB BE BLESSING AND HONOR AND GLORY AND MIGHT FOREVER AND EVER

 AND THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES SAID AMEN

 AND THE ELDERS FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPED

NOW I WATCHED WHEN THE LAMB OPENED ONE OF THE SEVEN SEALS AND I HEARD ONE OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES SAY WITH A VOICE LIKE THUNDER COME

 AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A WHITE HORSE

AND ITS RIDER HAD A BOW AND A CROWN WAS GIVEN TO HIM AND HE CAME OUT CONQUERING AND TO CONQUER

WHEN HE OPENED THE SECOND SEAL I HEARD THE SECOND LIVING CREATURE SAY COME

 AND OUT CAME ANOTHER HORSE BRIGHT RED

ITS RIDER WAS PERMITTED TO TAKE PEACE FROM THE EARTH SO THAT MEN SHOULD SLAY ONE ANOTHER AND HE WAS GIVEN A GREAT SWORD

WHEN HE OPENED THE THIRD SEAL I HEARD THE THIRD LIVING CREATURE SAY COME

 AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A BLACK HORSE

AND ITS RIDER HAD A PAIR OF SCALES IN HIS HAND

AND I HEARD WHAT SEEMED TO BE A VOICE IN THE MIDST OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES SAYING A QUART OF WHEAT FOR A DENARIUS AND THREE QUARTS OF BARLEY FOR A DENARIUS AND DO NOT HARM THE OIL AND WINE

 WHEN HE OPENED THE FOURTH SEAL I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOURTH LIVING CREATURE SAY COME

 AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A PALE HORSE

AND ITS RIDER'S NAME WAS DEATH AND HADES FOLLOWED HIM

AND THEY WERE GIVEN AUTHORITY OVER A FOURTH OF THE EARTH TO KILL WITH SWORD AND WITH FAMINE AND WITH PESTILENCE AND BY WILD BEASTS OF THE EARTH

WHEN HE OPENED THE FIFTH SEAL I SAW UNDER THE ALTAR THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN SLAIN FOR THE WORD OF GOD AND FOR THE WITNESS THEY HAD BORNE

THEY CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE O SOVEREIGN LORD HOLY AND TRUE HOW LONG BEFORE YOU WILL JUDGE AND AVENGE OUR BLOOD ON THOSE WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH

 THEN THEY WERE EACH GIVEN A WHITE ROBE AND TOLD TO REST A LITTLE LONGER UNTIL THE NUMBER OF THEIR FELLOW SERVANTS AND THEIR BROTHERS SHOULD BE COMPLETE WHO WERE TO BE KILLED AS THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN

WHEN HE OPENED THE SIXTH SEAL I LOOKED AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE AND THE SUN BECAME BLACK AS SACKCLOTH THE FULL MOON BECAME LIKE BLOOD AND THE STARS OF THE SKY FELL TO THE EARTH AS THE FIG TREE SHEDS ITS WINTER FRUIT WHEN SHAKEN BY A GALE

THE SKY VANISHED LIKE A SCROLL THAT IS BEING ROLLED UP AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND ISLAND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS PLACE

THEN THE KINGS OF THE EARTH AND THE GREAT ONES AND THE GENERALS AND THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL AND EVERYONE SLAVE AND FREE HID THEMSELVES IN THE CAVES AND AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE MOUNTAINS CALLING TO THE MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS FALL ON US AND HIDE US FROM THE FACE OF HIM WHO IS SEATED ON THE THRONE AND FROM THE WRATH OF THE LAMB FOR THE GREAT DAY OF THEIR WRATH HAS COME AND WHO CAN STAND

AFTER THIS I SAW FOUR ANGELS STANDING AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH HOLDING BACK THE FOUR WINDS OF THE EARTH THAT NO WIND MIGHT BLOW ON EARTH OR SEA OR AGAINST ANY TREE

THEN I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL ASCENDING FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN WITH THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD AND HE CALLED WITH A LOUD VOICE TO THE FOUR ANGELS WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN POWER TO HARM EARTH AND SEA SAYING DO NOT HARM THE EARTH OR THE SEA OR THE TREES UNTIL WE HAVE SEALED THE SERVANTS OF OUR GOD ON THEIR FOREHEADS

 AND I HEARD THE NUMBER OF THE SEALED  SEALED FROM EVERY TRIBE OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL  FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDAH WERE SEALED  FROM THE TRIBE OF REUBEN  FROM THE TRIBE OF GAD  FROM THE TRIBE OF ASHER  FROM THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI  FROM THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH  FROM THE TRIBE OF SIMEON  FROM THE TRIBE OF LEVI  FROM THE TRIBE OF ISSACHAR  FROM THE TRIBE OF ZEBULUN  FROM THE TRIBE OF JOSEPH  FROM THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN WERE SEALED

AFTER THIS I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A GREAT MULTITUDE THAT NO ONE COULD NUMBER FROM EVERY NATION FROM ALL TRIBES AND PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES STANDING BEFORE THE THRONE AND BEFORE THE LAMB CLOTHED IN WHITE ROBES WITH PALM BRANCHES IN THEIR HANDS AND CRYING OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE SALVATION BELONGS TO OUR GOD WHO SITS ON THE THRONE AND TO THE LAMB

 AND ALL THE ANGELS WERE STANDING AROUND THE THRONE AND AROUND THE ELDERS AND THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES AND THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES BEFORE THE THRONE AND WORSHIPED GOD SAYING AMEN

BLESSING AND GLORY AND WISDOM AND THANKSGIVING AND HONOR AND POWER AND MIGHT BE TO OUR GOD FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

 THEN ONE OF THE ELDERS ADDRESSED ME SAYING WHO ARE THESE CLOTHED IN WHITE ROBES AND FROM WHERE HAVE THEY COME

 I SAID TO HIM SIR YOU KNOW

 AND HE SAID TO ME THESE ARE THE ONES COMING OUT OF THE GREAT TRIBULATION

THEY HAVE WASHED THEIR ROBES AND MADE THEM WHITE IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB

THEREFORE THEY ARE BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD AND SERVE HIM DAY AND NIGHT IN HIS TEMPLE; AND HE WHO SITS ON THE THRONE WILL SHELTER THEM WITH HIS PRESENCE

THEY SHALL HUNGER NO MORE NEITHER THIRST ANYMORE; THE SUN SHALL NOT STRIKE THEM NOR ANY SCORCHING HEAT

FOR THE LAMB IN THE MIDST OF THE THRONE WILL BE THEIR SHEPHERD AND HE WILL GUIDE THEM TO SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER AND GOD WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES

WHEN THE LAMB OPENED THE SEVENTH SEAL THERE WAS SILENCE IN HEAVEN FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR

THEN I SAW THE SEVEN ANGELS WHO STAND BEFORE GOD AND SEVEN TRUMPETS WERE GIVEN TO THEM

AND ANOTHER ANGEL CAME AND STOOD AT THE ALTAR WITH A GOLDEN CENSER AND HE WAS GIVEN MUCH INCENSE TO OFFER WITH THE PRAYERS OF ALL THE SAINTS ON THE GOLDEN ALTAR BEFORE THE THRONE AND THE SMOKE OF THE INCENSE WITH THE PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS ROSE BEFORE GOD FROM THE HAND OF THE ANGEL

THEN THE ANGEL TOOK THE CENSER AND FILLED IT WITH FIRE FROM THE ALTAR AND THREW IT ON THE EARTH AND THERE WERE PEALS OF THUNDER RUMBLINGS FLASHES OF LIGHTNING AND AN EARTHQUAKE

NOW THE SEVEN ANGELS WHO HAD THE SEVEN TRUMPETS PREPARED TO BLOW THEM

THE FIRST ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND THERE FOLLOWED HAIL AND FIRE MIXED WITH BLOOD AND THESE WERE THROWN UPON THE EARTH

AND A THIRD OF THE EARTH WAS BURNED UP AND A THIRD OF THE TREES WERE BURNED UP AND ALL GREEN GRASS WAS BURNED UP

THE SECOND ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT MOUNTAIN BURNING WITH FIRE WAS THROWN INTO THE SEA AND A THIRD OF THE SEA BECAME BLOOD

A THIRD OF THE LIVING CREATURES IN THE SEA DIED AND A THIRD OF THE SHIPS WERE DESTROYED

THE THIRD ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND A GREAT STAR FELL FROM HEAVEN BLAZING LIKE A TORCH AND IT FELL ON A THIRD OF THE RIVERS AND ON THE SPRINGS OF WATER

THE NAME OF THE STAR IS WORMWOOD

A THIRD OF THE WATERS BECAME WORMWOOD AND MANY PEOPLE DIED FROM THE WATER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN MADE BITTER

THE FOURTH ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND A THIRD OF THE SUN WAS STRUCK AND A THIRD OF THE MOON AND A THIRD OF THE STARS SO THAT A THIRD OF THEIR LIGHT MIGHT BE DARKENED AND A THIRD OF THE DAY MIGHT BE KEPT FROM SHINING AND LIKEWISE A THIRD OF THE NIGHT

THEN I LOOKED AND I HEARD AN EAGLE CRYING WITH A LOUD VOICE AS IT FLEW DIRECTLY OVERHEAD WOE WOE WOE TO THOSE WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH AT THE BLASTS OF THE OTHER TRUMPETS THAT THE THREE ANGELS ARE ABOUT TO BLOW

AND THE FIFTH ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND I SAW A STAR FALLEN FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH AND HE WAS GIVEN THE KEY TO THE SHAFT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT

HE OPENED THE SHAFT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND FROM THE SHAFT ROSE SMOKE LIKE THE SMOKE OF A GREAT FURNACE AND THE SUN AND THE AIR WERE DARKENED WITH THE SMOKE FROM THE SHAFT

THEN FROM THE SMOKE CAME LOCUSTS ON THE EARTH AND THEY WERE GIVEN POWER LIKE THE POWER OF SCORPIONS OF THE EARTH

THEY WERE TOLD NOT TO HARM THE GRASS OF THE EARTH OR ANY GREEN PLANT OR ANY TREE BUT ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE SEAL OF GOD ON THEIR FOREHEADS

THEY WERE ALLOWED TO TORMENT THEM FOR FIVE MONTHS BUT NOT TO KILL THEM AND THEIR TORMENT WAS LIKE THE TORMENT OF A SCORPION WHEN IT STINGS SOMEONE

AND IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE WILL SEEK DEATH AND WILL NOT FIND IT

THEY WILL LONG TO DIE BUT DEATH WILL FLEE FROM THEM

IN APPEARANCE THE LOCUSTS WERE LIKE HORSES PREPARED FOR BATTLE ON THEIR HEADS WERE WHAT LOOKED LIKE CROWNS OF GOLD; THEIR FACES WERE LIKE HUMAN FACES THEIR HAIR LIKE WOMEN'S HAIR AND THEIR TEETH LIKE LIONS' TEETH; THEY HAD BREASTPLATES LIKE BREASTPLATES OF IRON AND THE NOISE OF THEIR WINGS WAS LIKE THE NOISE OF MANY CHARIOTS WITH HORSES RUSHING INTO BATTLE

THEY HAVE TAILS AND STINGS LIKE SCORPIONS AND THEIR POWER TO HURT PEOPLE FOR FIVE MONTHS IS IN THEIR TAILS

THEY HAVE AS KING OVER THEM THE ANGEL OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT

HIS NAME IN HEBREW IS ABADDON AND IN GREEK HE IS CALLED APOLLYON

THE FIRST WOE HAS PASSED; BEHOLD TWO WOES ARE STILL TO COME

THEN THE SIXTH ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND I HEARD A VOICE FROM THE FOUR HORNS OF THE GOLDEN ALTAR BEFORE GOD SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHO HAD THE TRUMPET RELEASE THE FOUR ANGELS WHO ARE BOUND AT THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES

 SO THE FOUR ANGELS WHO HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE HOUR THE DAY THE MONTH AND THE YEAR WERE RELEASED TO KILL A THIRD OF MANKIND

THE NUMBER OF MOUNTED TROOPS WAS TWICE TEN THOUSAND TIMES TEN THOUSAND; I HEARD THEIR NUMBER

AND THIS IS HOW I SAW THE HORSES IN MY VISION AND THOSE WHO RODE THEM THEY WORE BREASTPLATES THE COLOR OF FIRE AND OF SAPPHIRE AND OF SULFUR AND THE HEADS OF THE HORSES WERE LIKE LIONS' HEADS AND FIRE AND SMOKE AND SULFUR CAME OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS

BY THESE THREE PLAGUES A THIRD OF MANKIND WAS KILLED BY THE FIRE AND SMOKE AND SULFUR COMING OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS

FOR THE POWER OF THE HORSES IS IN THEIR MOUTHS AND IN THEIR TAILS FOR THEIR TAILS ARE LIKE SERPENTS WITH HEADS AND BY MEANS OF THEM THEY WOUND

THE REST OF MANKIND WHO WERE NOT KILLED BY THESE PLAGUES DID NOT REPENT OF THE WORKS OF THEIR HANDS NOR GIVE UP WORSHIPING DEMONS AND IDOLS OF GOLD AND SILVER AND BRONZE AND STONE AND WOOD WHICH CANNOT SEE OR HEAR OR WALK NOR DID THEY REPENT OF THEIR MURDERS OR THEIR SORCERIES OR THEIR SEXUAL IMMORALITY OR THEIR THEFTS

THEN I SAW ANOTHER MIGHTY ANGEL COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN WRAPPED IN A CLOUD WITH A RAINBOW OVER HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE WAS LIKE THE SUN AND HIS LEGS LIKE PILLARS OF FIRE

HE HAD A LITTLE SCROLL OPEN IN HIS HAND

AND HE SET HIS RIGHT FOOT ON THE SEA AND HIS LEFT FOOT ON THE LAND AND CALLED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE LIKE A LION ROARING

WHEN HE CALLED OUT THE SEVEN THUNDERS SOUNDED

AND WHEN THE SEVEN THUNDERS HAD SOUNDED I WAS ABOUT TO WRITE BUT I HEARD A VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING SEAL UP WHAT THE SEVEN THUNDERS HAVE SAID AND DO NOT WRITE IT DOWN

 AND THE ANGEL WHOM I SAW STANDING ON THE SEA AND ON THE LAND RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND TO HEAVEN AND SWORE BY HIM WHO LIVES FOREVER AND EVER WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND WHAT IS IN IT THE EARTH AND WHAT IS IN IT AND THE SEA AND WHAT IS IN IT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE DELAY BUT THAT IN THE DAYS OF THE TRUMPET CALL TO BE SOUNDED BY THE SEVENTH ANGEL THE MYSTERY OF GOD WOULD BE FULFILLED JUST AS HE ANNOUNCED TO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

THEN THE VOICE THAT I HAD HEARD FROM HEAVEN SPOKE TO ME AGAIN SAYING GO TAKE THE SCROLL THAT IS OPEN IN THE HAND OF THE ANGEL WHO IS STANDING ON THE SEA AND ON THE LAND

 SO I WENT TO THE ANGEL AND TOLD HIM TO GIVE ME THE LITTLE SCROLL

AND HE SAID TO ME TAKE AND EAT IT; IT WILL MAKE YOUR STOMACH BITTER BUT IN YOUR MOUTH IT WILL BE SWEET AS HONEY

 AND I TOOK THE LITTLE SCROLL FROM THE HAND OF THE ANGEL AND ATE IT

IT WAS SWEET AS HONEY IN MY MOUTH BUT WHEN I HAD EATEN IT MY STOMACH WAS MADE BITTER

AND I WAS TOLD YOU MUST AGAIN PROPHESY ABOUT MANY PEOPLES AND NATIONS AND LANGUAGES AND KINGS

THEN I WAS GIVEN A MEASURING ROD LIKE A STAFF AND I WAS TOLD RISE AND MEASURE THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND THE ALTAR AND THOSE WHO WORSHIP THERE BUT DO NOT MEASURE THE COURT OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE; LEAVE THAT OUT FOR IT IS GIVEN OVER TO THE NATIONS AND THEY WILL TRAMPLE THE HOLY CITY FOR FORTYTWO MONTHS

AND I WILL GRANT AUTHORITY TO MY TWO WITNESSES AND THEY WILL PROPHESY FOR  DAYS CLOTHED IN SACKCLOTH

 THESE ARE THE TWO OLIVE TREES AND THE TWO LAMPSTANDS THAT STAND BEFORE THE LORD OF THE EARTH

AND IF ANYONE WOULD HARM THEM FIRE POURS FROM THEIR MOUTH AND CONSUMES THEIR FOES

IF ANYONE WOULD HARM THEM THIS IS HOW HE IS DOOMED TO BE KILLED

THEY HAVE THE POWER TO SHUT THE SKY THAT NO RAIN MAY FALL DURING THE DAYS OF THEIR PROPHESYING AND THEY HAVE POWER OVER THE WATERS TO TURN THEM INTO BLOOD AND TO STRIKE THE EARTH WITH EVERY KIND OF PLAGUE AS OFTEN AS THEY DESIRE

AND WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED THEIR TESTIMONY THE BEAST THAT RISES FROM THE BOTTOMLESS PIT WILL MAKE WAR ON THEM AND CONQUER THEM AND KILL THEM AND THEIR DEAD BODIES WILL LIE IN THE STREET OF THE GREAT CITY THAT SYMBOLICALLY IS CALLED SODOM AND EGYPT WHERE THEIR LORD WAS CRUCIFIED

FOR THREE AND A HALF DAYS SOME FROM THE PEOPLES AND TRIBES AND LANGUAGES AND NATIONS WILL GAZE AT THEIR DEAD BODIES AND REFUSE TO LET THEM BE PLACED IN A TOMB AND THOSE WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH WILL REJOICE OVER THEM AND MAKE MERRY AND EXCHANGE PRESENTS BECAUSE THESE TWO PROPHETS HAD BEEN A TORMENT TO THOSE WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH

BUT AFTER THE THREE AND A HALF DAYS A BREATH OF LIFE FROM GOD ENTERED THEM AND THEY STOOD UP ON THEIR FEET AND GREAT FEAR FELL ON THOSE WHO SAW THEM

THEN THEY HEARD A LOUD VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING TO THEM COME UP HERE

 AND THEY WENT UP TO HEAVEN IN A CLOUD AND THEIR ENEMIES WATCHED THEM

AND AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE AND A TENTH OF THE CITY FELL

SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE EARTHQUAKE AND THE REST WERE TERRIFIED AND GAVE GLORY TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN

THE SECOND WOE HAS PASSED; BEHOLD THE THIRD WOE IS SOON TO COME

THEN THE SEVENTH ANGEL BLEW HIS TRUMPET AND THERE WERE LOUD VOICES IN HEAVEN SAYING THE KINGDOM OF THE WORLD HAS BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST AND HE SHALL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER

 AND THE TWENTYFOUR ELDERS WHO SIT ON THEIR THRONES BEFORE GOD FELL ON THEIR FACES AND WORSHIPED GOD SAYING WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO IS AND WHO WAS FOR YOU HAVE TAKEN YOUR GREAT POWER AND BEGUN TO REIGN

THE NATIONS RAGED BUT YOUR WRATH CAME AND THE TIME FOR THE DEAD TO BE JUDGED AND FOR REWARDING YOUR SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND SAINTS AND THOSE WHO FEAR YOUR NAME BOTH SMALL AND GREAT AND FOR DESTROYING THE DESTROYERS OF THE EARTH

 THEN GOD'S TEMPLE IN HEAVEN WAS OPENED AND THE ARK OF HIS COVENANT WAS SEEN WITHIN HIS TEMPLE

THERE WERE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING RUMBLINGS PEALS OF THUNDER AN EARTHQUAKE AND HEAVY HAIL

AND A GREAT SIGN APPEARED IN HEAVEN A WOMAN CLOTHED WITH THE SUN WITH THE MOON UNDER HER FEET AND ON HER HEAD A CROWN OF TWELVE STARS

SHE WAS PREGNANT AND WAS CRYING OUT IN BIRTH PAINS AND THE AGONY OF GIVING BIRTH

AND ANOTHER SIGN APPEARED IN HEAVEN BEHOLD A GREAT RED DRAGON WITH SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS AND ON HIS HEADS SEVEN DIADEMS

HIS TAIL SWEPT DOWN A THIRD OF THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND CAST THEM TO THE EARTH

AND THE DRAGON STOOD BEFORE THE WOMAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH SO THAT WHEN SHE BORE HER CHILD HE MIGHT DEVOUR IT

SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A MALE CHILD ONE WHO IS TO RULE ALL THE NATIONS WITH A ROD OF IRON BUT HER CHILD WAS CAUGHT UP TO GOD AND TO HIS THRONE AND THE WOMAN FLED INTO THE WILDERNESS WHERE SHE HAS A PLACE PREPARED BY GOD IN WHICH SHE IS TO BE NOURISHED FOR  DAYS

NOW WAR AROSE IN HEAVEN MICHAEL AND HIS ANGELS FIGHTING AGAINST THE DRAGON

AND THE DRAGON AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT BACK BUT HE WAS DEFEATED AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY PLACE FOR THEM IN HEAVEN

AND THE GREAT DRAGON WAS THROWN DOWN THAT ANCIENT SERPENT WHO IS CALLED THE DEVIL AND SATAN THE DECEIVER OF THE WHOLE WORLDHE WAS THROWN DOWN TO THE EARTH AND HIS ANGELS WERE THROWN DOWN WITH HIM

AND I HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN HEAVEN SAYING NOW THE SALVATION AND THE POWER AND THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD AND THE AUTHORITY OF HIS CHRIST HAVE COME FOR THE ACCUSER OF OUR BROTHERS HAS BEEN THROWN DOWN WHO ACCUSES THEM DAY AND NIGHT BEFORE OUR GOD

AND THEY HAVE CONQUERED HIM BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB AND BY THE WORD OF THEIR TESTIMONY FOR THEY LOVED NOT THEIR LIVES EVEN UNTO DEATH

THEREFORE REJOICE O HEAVENS AND YOU WHO DWELL IN THEM

BUT WOE TO YOU O EARTH AND SEA FOR THE DEVIL HAS COME DOWN TO YOU IN GREAT WRATH BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HIS TIME IS SHORT

 AND WHEN THE DRAGON SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN TO THE EARTH HE PURSUED THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE MALE CHILD

BUT THE WOMAN WAS GIVEN THE TWO WINGS OF THE GREAT EAGLE SO THAT SHE MIGHT FLY FROM THE SERPENT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE IS TO BE NOURISHED FOR A TIME AND TIMES AND HALF A TIME

THE SERPENT POURED WATER LIKE A RIVER OUT OF HIS MOUTH AFTER THE WOMAN TO SWEEP HER AWAY WITH A FLOOD

BUT THE EARTH CAME TO THE HELP OF THE WOMAN AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THE RIVER THAT THE DRAGON HAD POURED FROM HIS MOUTH

THEN THE DRAGON BECAME FURIOUS WITH THE WOMAN AND WENT OFF TO MAKE WAR ON THE REST OF HER OFFSPRING ON THOSE WHO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND HOLD TO THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS

AND HE STOOD ON THE SAND OF THE SEA

AND I SAW A BEAST RISING OUT OF THE SEA WITH TEN HORNS AND SEVEN HEADS WITH TEN DIADEMS ON ITS HORNS AND BLASPHEMOUS NAMES ON ITS HEADS

AND THE BEAST THAT I SAW WAS LIKE A LEOPARD; ITS FEET WERE LIKE A BEAR'S AND ITS MOUTH WAS LIKE A LION'S MOUTH

AND TO IT THE DRAGON GAVE HIS POWER AND HIS THRONE AND GREAT AUTHORITY

ONE OF ITS HEADS SEEMED TO HAVE A MORTAL WOUND BUT ITS MORTAL WOUND WAS HEALED AND THE WHOLE EARTH MARVELED AS THEY FOLLOWED THE BEAST

AND THEY WORSHIPED THE DRAGON FOR HE HAD GIVEN HIS AUTHORITY TO THE BEAST AND THEY WORSHIPED THE BEAST SAYING WHO IS LIKE THE BEAST AND WHO CAN FIGHT AGAINST IT

 AND THE BEAST WAS GIVEN A MOUTH UTTERING HAUGHTY AND BLASPHEMOUS WORDS AND IT WAS ALLOWED TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY FOR FORTYTWO MONTHS

IT OPENED ITS MOUTH TO UTTER BLASPHEMIES AGAINST GOD BLASPHEMING HIS NAME AND HIS DWELLING THAT IS THOSE WHO DWELL IN HEAVEN

ALSO IT WAS ALLOWED TO MAKE WAR ON THE SAINTS AND TO CONQUER THEM

AND AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN IT OVER EVERY TRIBE AND PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE AND NATION AND ALL WHO DWELL ON EARTH WILL WORSHIP IT EVERYONE WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD IN THE BOOK OF LIFE OF THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN

IF ANYONE HAS AN EAR LET HIM HEAR IF ANYONE IS TO BE TAKEN CAPTIVE TO CAPTIVITY HE GOES; IF ANYONE IS TO BE SLAIN WITH THE SWORD WITH THE SWORD MUST HE BE SLAIN

HERE IS A CALL FOR THE ENDURANCE AND FAITH OF THE SAINTS

THEN I SAW ANOTHER BEAST RISING OUT OF THE EARTH

IT HAD TWO HORNS LIKE A LAMB AND IT SPOKE LIKE A DRAGON

IT EXERCISES ALL THE AUTHORITY OF THE FIRST BEAST IN ITS PRESENCE AND MAKES THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS WORSHIP THE FIRST BEAST WHOSE MORTAL WOUND WAS HEALED

IT PERFORMS GREAT SIGNS EVEN MAKING FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND BY THE SIGNS THAT IT IS ALLOWED TO WORK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BEAST IT DECEIVES THOSE WHO DWELL ON EARTH TELLING THEM TO MAKE AN IMAGE FOR THE BEAST THAT WAS WOUNDED BY THE SWORD AND YET LIVED

AND IT WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE BREATH TO THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST SO THAT THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST MIGHT EVEN SPEAK AND MIGHT CAUSE THOSE WHO WOULD NOT WORSHIP THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST TO BE SLAIN

ALSO IT CAUSES ALL BOTH SMALL AND GREAT BOTH RICH AND POOR BOTH FREE AND SLAVE TO BE MARKED ON THE RIGHT HAND OR THE FOREHEAD SO THAT NO ONE CAN BUY OR SELL UNLESS HE HAS THE MARK THAT IS THE NAME OF THE BEAST OR THE NUMBER OF ITS NAME

THIS CALLS FOR WISDOM LET THE ONE WHO HAS UNDERSTANDING CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST FOR IT IS THE NUMBER OF A MAN AND HIS NUMBER IS 

THEN I LOOKED AND BEHOLD ON MOUNT ZION STOOD THE LAMB AND WITH HIM  WHO HAD HIS NAME AND HIS FATHER'S NAME WRITTEN ON THEIR FOREHEADS

AND I HEARD A VOICE FROM HEAVEN LIKE THE ROAR OF MANY WATERS AND LIKE THE SOUND OF LOUD THUNDER

THE VOICE I HEARD WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF HARPISTS PLAYING ON THEIR HARPS AND THEY WERE SINGING A NEW SONG BEFORE THE THRONE AND BEFORE THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES AND BEFORE THE ELDERS

NO ONE COULD LEARN THAT SONG EXCEPT THE  WHO HAD BEEN REDEEMED FROM THE EARTH

IT IS THESE WHO HAVE NOT DEFILED THEMSELVES WITH WOMEN FOR THEY ARE VIRGINS

IT IS THESE WHO FOLLOW THE LAMB WHEREVER HE GOES

THESE HAVE BEEN REDEEMED FROM MANKIND AS FIRSTFRUITS FOR GOD AND THE LAMB AND IN THEIR MOUTH NO LIE WAS FOUND FOR THEY ARE BLAMELESS

THEN I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL FLYING DIRECTLY OVERHEAD WITH AN ETERNAL GOSPEL TO PROCLAIM TO THOSE WHO DWELL ON EARTH TO EVERY NATION AND TRIBE AND LANGUAGE AND PEOPLE

AND HE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE FEAR GOD AND GIVE HIM GLORY BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HIS JUDGMENT HAS COME AND WORSHIP HIM WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH THE SEA AND THE SPRINGS OF WATER

 ANOTHER ANGEL A SECOND FOLLOWED SAYING FALLEN FALLEN IS BABYLON THE GREAT SHE WHO MADE ALL NATIONS DRINK THE WINE OF THE PASSION OF HER SEXUAL IMMORALITY

 AND ANOTHER ANGEL A THIRD FOLLOWED THEM SAYING WITH A LOUD VOICE IF ANYONE WORSHIPS THE BEAST AND ITS IMAGE AND RECEIVES A MARK ON HIS FOREHEAD OR ON HIS HAND HE ALSO WILL DRINK THE WINE OF GOD'S WRATH POURED FULL STRENGTH INTO THE CUP OF HIS ANGER AND HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB

AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT GOES UP FOREVER AND EVER AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY OR NIGHT THESE WORSHIPERS OF THE BEAST AND ITS IMAGE AND WHOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF ITS NAME

 HERE IS A CALL FOR THE ENDURANCE OF THE SAINTS THOSE WHO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND THEIR FAITH IN JESUS

AND I HEARD A VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING WRITE THIS BLESSED ARE THE DEAD WHO DIE IN THE LORD FROM NOW ON

BLESSED INDEED SAYS THE SPIRIT THAT THEY MAY REST FROM THEIR LABORS FOR THEIR DEEDS FOLLOW THEM

 THEN I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A WHITE CLOUD AND SEATED ON THE CLOUD ONE LIKE A SON OF MAN WITH A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD AND A SHARP SICKLE IN HIS HAND

AND ANOTHER ANGEL CAME OUT OF THE TEMPLE CALLING WITH A LOUD VOICE TO HIM WHO SAT ON THE CLOUD PUT IN YOUR SICKLE AND REAP FOR THE HOUR TO REAP HAS COME FOR THE HARVEST OF THE EARTH IS FULLY RIPE

 SO HE WHO SAT ON THE CLOUD SWUNG HIS SICKLE ACROSS THE EARTH AND THE EARTH WAS REAPED

THEN ANOTHER ANGEL CAME OUT OF THE TEMPLE IN HEAVEN AND HE TOO HAD A SHARP SICKLE

AND ANOTHER ANGEL CAME OUT FROM THE ALTAR THE ANGEL WHO HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE FIRE AND HE CALLED WITH A LOUD VOICE TO THE ONE WHO HAD THE SHARP SICKLE PUT IN YOUR SICKLE AND GATHER THE CLUSTERS FROM THE VINE OF THE EARTH FOR ITS GRAPES ARE RIPE

 SO THE ANGEL SWUNG HIS SICKLE ACROSS THE EARTH AND GATHERED THE GRAPE HARVEST OF THE EARTH AND THREW IT INTO THE GREAT WINEPRESS OF THE WRATH OF GOD

AND THE WINEPRESS WAS TRODDEN OUTSIDE THE CITY AND BLOOD FLOWED FROM THE WINEPRESS AS HIGH AS A HORSE'S BRIDLE FOR  STADIA

THEN I SAW ANOTHER SIGN IN HEAVEN GREAT AND AMAZING SEVEN ANGELS WITH SEVEN PLAGUES WHICH ARE THE LAST FOR WITH THEM THE WRATH OF GOD IS FINISHED

AND I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SEA OF GLASS MINGLED WITH FIREAND ALSO THOSE WHO HAD CONQUERED THE BEAST AND ITS IMAGE AND THE NUMBER OF ITS NAME STANDING BESIDE THE SEA OF GLASS WITH HARPS OF GOD IN THEIR HANDS

AND THEY SING THE SONG OF MOSES THE SERVANT OF GOD AND THE SONG OF THE LAMB SAYING GREAT AND AMAZING ARE YOUR DEEDS O LORD GOD THE ALMIGHTY

JUST AND TRUE ARE YOUR WAYS O KING OF THE NATIONS

WHO WILL NOT FEAR O LORD AND GLORIFY YOUR NAME

FOR YOU ALONE ARE HOLY

ALL NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP YOU FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED

 AFTER THIS I LOOKED AND THE SANCTUARY OF THE TENT OF WITNESS IN HEAVEN WAS OPENED AND OUT OF THE SANCTUARY CAME THE SEVEN ANGELS WITH THE SEVEN PLAGUES CLOTHED IN PURE BRIGHT LINEN WITH GOLDEN SASHES AROUND THEIR CHESTS

AND ONE OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES GAVE TO THE SEVEN ANGELS SEVEN GOLDEN BOWLS FULL OF THE WRATH OF GOD WHO LIVES FOREVER AND EVER AND THE SANCTUARY WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE FROM THE GLORY OF GOD AND FROM HIS POWER AND NO ONE COULD ENTER THE SANCTUARY UNTIL THE SEVEN PLAGUES OF THE SEVEN ANGELS WERE FINISHED

THEN I HEARD A LOUD VOICE FROM THE TEMPLE TELLING THE SEVEN ANGELS GO AND POUR OUT ON THE EARTH THE SEVEN BOWLS OF THE WRATH OF GOD

 SO THE FIRST ANGEL WENT AND POURED OUT HIS BOWL ON THE EARTH AND HARMFUL AND PAINFUL SORES CAME UPON THE PEOPLE WHO BORE THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND WORSHIPED ITS IMAGE

THE SECOND ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL INTO THE SEA AND IT BECAME LIKE THE BLOOD OF A CORPSE AND EVERY LIVING THING DIED THAT WAS IN THE SEA

THE THIRD ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL INTO THE RIVERS AND THE SPRINGS OF WATER AND THEY BECAME BLOOD

AND I HEARD THE ANGEL IN CHARGE OF THE WATERS SAY JUST ARE YOU O HOLY ONE WHO IS AND WHO WAS FOR YOU BROUGHT THESE JUDGMENTS

FOR THEY HAVE SHED THE BLOOD OF SAINTS AND PROPHETS AND YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM BLOOD TO DRINK

IT IS WHAT THEY DESERVE

 AND I HEARD THE ALTAR SAYING YES LORD GOD THE ALMIGHTY TRUE AND JUST ARE YOUR JUDGMENTS

 THE FOURTH ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL ON THE SUN AND IT WAS ALLOWED TO SCORCH PEOPLE WITH FIRE

THEY WERE SCORCHED BY THE FIERCE HEAT AND THEY CURSED THE NAME OF GOD WHO HAD POWER OVER THESE PLAGUES

THEY DID NOT REPENT AND GIVE HIM GLORY

THE FIFTH ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL ON THE THRONE OF THE BEAST AND ITS KINGDOM WAS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS

PEOPLE GNAWED THEIR TONGUES IN ANGUISH AND CURSED THE GOD OF HEAVEN FOR THEIR PAIN AND SORES

THEY DID NOT REPENT OF THEIR DEEDS

THE SIXTH ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL ON THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES AND ITS WATER WAS DRIED UP TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE KINGS FROM THE EAST

AND I SAW COMING OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE DRAGON AND OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE BEAST AND OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE FALSE PROPHET THREE UNCLEAN SPIRITS LIKE FROGS

FOR THEY ARE DEMONIC SPIRITS PERFORMING SIGNS WHO GO ABROAD TO THE KINGS OF THE WHOLE WORLD TO ASSEMBLE THEM FOR BATTLE ON THE GREAT DAY OF GOD THE ALMIGHTY

BEHOLD I AM COMING LIKE A THIEF

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO STAYS AWAKE KEEPING HIS GARMENTS ON THAT HE MAY NOT GO ABOUT NAKED AND BE SEEN EXPOSED

 AND THEY ASSEMBLED THEM AT THE PLACE THAT IN HEBREW IS CALLED ARMAGEDDON

THE SEVENTH ANGEL POURED OUT HIS BOWL INTO THE AIR AND A LOUD VOICE CAME OUT OF THE TEMPLE FROM THE THRONE SAYING IT IS DONE

 AND THERE WERE FLASHES OF LIGHTNING RUMBLINGS PEALS OF THUNDER AND A GREAT EARTHQUAKE SUCH AS THERE HAD NEVER BEEN SINCE MAN WAS ON THE EARTH SO GREAT WAS THAT EARTHQUAKE

THE GREAT CITY WAS SPLIT INTO THREE PARTS AND THE CITIES OF THE NATIONS FELL AND GOD REMEMBERED BABYLON THE GREAT TO MAKE HER DRAIN THE CUP OF THE WINE OF THE FURY OF HIS WRATH

AND EVERY ISLAND FLED AWAY AND NO MOUNTAINS WERE TO BE FOUND

AND GREAT HAILSTONES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH FELL FROM HEAVEN ON PEOPLE; AND THEY CURSED GOD FOR THE PLAGUE OF THE HAIL BECAUSE THE PLAGUE WAS SO SEVERE

THEN ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS WHO HAD THE SEVEN BOWLS CAME AND SAID TO ME COME I WILL SHOW YOU THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT PROSTITUTE WHO IS SEATED ON MANY WATERS WITH WHOM THE KINGS OF THE EARTH HAVE COMMITTED SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND WITH THE WINE OF WHOSE SEXUAL IMMORALITY THE DWELLERS ON EARTH HAVE BECOME DRUNK

 AND HE CARRIED ME AWAY IN THE SPIRIT INTO A WILDERNESS AND I SAW A WOMAN SITTING ON A SCARLET BEAST THAT WAS FULL OF BLASPHEMOUS NAMES AND IT HAD SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS

THE WOMAN WAS ARRAYED IN PURPLE AND SCARLET AND ADORNED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS AND PEARLS HOLDING IN HER HAND A GOLDEN CUP FULL OF ABOMINATIONS AND THE IMPURITIES OF HER SEXUAL IMMORALITY

AND ON HER FOREHEAD WAS WRITTEN A NAME OF MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF EARTH'S ABOMINATIONS

 AND I SAW THE WOMAN DRUNK WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS OF JESUS

WHEN I SAW HER I MARVELED GREATLY

BUT THE ANGEL SAID TO ME WHY DO YOU MARVEL

I WILL TELL YOU THE MYSTERY OF THE WOMAN AND OF THE BEAST WITH SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS THAT CARRIES HER

THE BEAST THAT YOU SAW WAS AND IS NOT AND IS ABOUT TO RISE FROM THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND GO TO DESTRUCTION

AND THE DWELLERS ON EARTH WHOSE NAMES HAVE NOT BEEN WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD WILL MARVEL TO SEE THE BEAST BECAUSE IT WAS AND IS NOT AND IS TO COME

THIS CALLS FOR A MIND WITH WISDOM THE SEVEN HEADS ARE SEVEN MOUNTAINS ON WHICH THE WOMAN IS SEATED; THEY ARE ALSO SEVEN KINGS FIVE OF WHOM HAVE FALLEN ONE IS THE OTHER HAS NOT YET COME AND WHEN HE DOES COME HE MUST REMAIN ONLY A LITTLE WHILE

AS FOR THE BEAST THAT WAS AND IS NOT IT IS AN EIGHTH BUT IT BELONGS TO THE SEVEN AND IT GOES TO DESTRUCTION

AND THE TEN HORNS THAT YOU SAW ARE TEN KINGS WHO HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ROYAL POWER BUT THEY ARE TO RECEIVE AUTHORITY AS KINGS FOR ONE HOUR TOGETHER WITH THE BEAST

THESE ARE OF ONE MIND AND HAND OVER THEIR POWER AND AUTHORITY TO THE BEAST

THEY WILL MAKE WAR ON THE LAMB AND THE LAMB WILL CONQUER THEM FOR HE IS LORD OF LORDS AND KING OF KINGS AND THOSE WITH HIM ARE CALLED AND CHOSEN AND FAITHFUL

 AND THE ANGEL SAID TO ME THE WATERS THAT YOU SAW WHERE THE PROSTITUTE IS SEATED ARE PEOPLES AND MULTITUDES AND NATIONS AND LANGUAGES

AND THE TEN HORNS THAT YOU SAW THEY AND THE BEAST WILL HATE THE PROSTITUTE

THEY WILL MAKE HER DESOLATE AND NAKED AND DEVOUR HER FLESH AND BURN HER UP WITH FIRE FOR GOD HAS PUT IT INTO THEIR HEARTS TO CARRY OUT HIS PURPOSE BY BEING OF ONE MIND AND HANDING OVER THEIR ROYAL POWER TO THE BEAST UNTIL THE WORDS OF GOD ARE FULFILLED

AND THE WOMAN THAT YOU SAW IS THE GREAT CITY THAT HAS DOMINION OVER THE KINGS OF THE EARTH

AFTER THIS I SAW ANOTHER ANGEL COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN HAVING GREAT AUTHORITY AND THE EARTH WAS MADE BRIGHT WITH HIS GLORY

AND HE CALLED OUT WITH A MIGHTY VOICE FALLEN FALLEN IS BABYLON THE GREAT

SHE HAS BECOME A DWELLING PLACE FOR DEMONS A HAUNT FOR EVERY UNCLEAN SPIRIT A HAUNT FOR EVERY UNCLEAN BIRD A HAUNT FOR EVERY UNCLEAN AND DETESTABLE BEAST

FOR ALL NATIONS HAVE DRUNK THE WINE OF THE PASSION OF HER SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH HAVE COMMITTED IMMORALITY WITH HER AND THE MERCHANTS OF THE EARTH HAVE GROWN RICH FROM THE POWER OF HER LUXURIOUS LIVING

 THEN I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE LEST YOU TAKE PART IN HER SINS LEST YOU SHARE IN HER PLAGUES; FOR HER SINS ARE HEAPED HIGH AS HEAVEN AND GOD HAS REMEMBERED HER INIQUITIES

PAY HER BACK AS SHE HERSELF HAS PAID BACK OTHERS AND REPAY HER DOUBLE FOR HER DEEDS; MIX A DOUBLE PORTION FOR HER IN THE CUP SHE MIXED

AS SHE GLORIFIED HERSELF AND LIVED IN LUXURY SO GIVE HER A LIKE MEASURE OF TORMENT AND MOURNING SINCE IN HER HEART SHE SAYS 'I SIT AS A QUEEN I AM NO WIDOW AND MOURNING I SHALL NEVER SEE

' FOR THIS REASON HER PLAGUES WILL COME IN A SINGLE DAY DEATH AND MOURNING AND FAMINE AND SHE WILL BE BURNED UP WITH FIRE; FOR MIGHTY IS THE LORD GOD WHO HAS JUDGED HER

 AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WHO COMMITTED SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND LIVED IN LUXURY WITH HER WILL WEEP AND WAIL OVER HER WHEN THEY SEE THE SMOKE OF HER BURNING

THEY WILL STAND FAR OFF IN FEAR OF HER TORMENT AND SAY ALAS

ALAS

YOU GREAT CITY YOU MIGHTY CITY BABYLON

FOR IN A SINGLE HOUR YOUR JUDGMENT HAS COME

 AND THE MERCHANTS OF THE EARTH WEEP AND MOURN FOR HER SINCE NO ONE BUYS THEIR CARGO ANYMORE CARGO OF GOLD SILVER JEWELS PEARLS FINE LINEN PURPLE CLOTH SILK SCARLET CLOTH ALL KINDS OF SCENTED WOOD ALL KINDS OF ARTICLES OF IVORY ALL KINDS OF ARTICLES OF COSTLY WOOD BRONZE IRON AND MARBLE CINNAMON SPICE INCENSE MYRRH FRANKINCENSE WINE OIL FINE FLOUR WHEAT CATTLE AND SHEEP HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND SLAVES THAT IS HUMAN SOULS

THE FRUIT FOR WHICH YOUR SOUL LONGED HAS GONE FROM YOU AND ALL YOUR DELICACIES AND YOUR SPLENDORS ARE LOST TO YOU NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN

 THE MERCHANTS OF THESE WARES WHO GAINED WEALTH FROM HER WILL STAND FAR OFF IN FEAR OF HER TORMENT WEEPING AND MOURNING ALOUD ALAS ALAS FOR THE GREAT CITY THAT WAS CLOTHED IN FINE LINEN IN PURPLE AND SCARLET ADORNED WITH GOLD WITH JEWELS AND WITH PEARLS

FOR IN A SINGLE HOUR ALL THIS WEALTH HAS BEEN LAID WASTE

AND ALL SHIPMASTERS AND SEAFARING MEN SAILORS AND ALL WHOSE TRADE IS ON THE SEA STOOD FAR OFF AND CRIED OUT AS THEY SAW THE SMOKE OF HER BURNING WHAT CITY WAS LIKE THE GREAT CITY

 AND THEY THREW DUST ON THEIR HEADS AS THEY WEPT AND MOURNED CRYING OUT ALAS ALAS FOR THE GREAT CITY WHERE ALL WHO HAD SHIPS AT SEA GREW RICH BY HER WEALTH

FOR IN A SINGLE HOUR SHE HAS BEEN LAID WASTE

REJOICE OVER HER O HEAVEN AND YOU SAINTS AND APOSTLES AND PROPHETS FOR GOD HAS GIVEN JUDGMENT FOR YOU AGAINST HER

 THEN A MIGHTY ANGEL TOOK UP A STONE LIKE A GREAT MILLSTONE AND THREW IT INTO THE SEA SAYING SO WILL BABYLON THE GREAT CITY BE THROWN DOWN WITH VIOLENCE AND WILL BE FOUND NO MORE; AND THE SOUND OF HARPISTS AND MUSICIANS OF FLUTE PLAYERS AND TRUMPETERS WILL BE HEARD IN YOU NO MORE AND A CRAFTSMAN OF ANY CRAFT WILL BE FOUND IN YOU NO MORE AND THE SOUND OF THE MILL WILL BE HEARD IN YOU NO MORE AND THE LIGHT OF A LAMP WILL SHINE IN YOU NO MORE AND THE VOICE OF BRIDEGROOM AND BRIDE WILL BE HEARD IN YOU NO MORE FOR YOUR MERCHANTS WERE THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH AND ALL NATIONS WERE DECEIVED BY YOUR SORCERY

AND IN HER WAS FOUND THE BLOOD OF PROPHETS AND OF SAINTS AND OF ALL WHO HAVE BEEN SLAIN ON EARTH

AFTER THIS I HEARD WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE LOUD VOICE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE IN HEAVEN CRYING OUT HALLELUJAH

SALVATION AND GLORY AND POWER BELONG TO OUR GOD FOR HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND JUST; FOR HE HAS JUDGED THE GREAT PROSTITUTE WHO CORRUPTED THE EARTH WITH HER IMMORALITY AND HAS AVENGED ON HER THE BLOOD OF HIS SERVANTS

 ONCE MORE THEY CRIED OUT HALLELUJAH

THE SMOKE FROM HER GOES UP FOREVER AND EVER

 AND THE TWENTYFOUR ELDERS AND THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPED GOD WHO WAS SEATED ON THE THRONE SAYING AMEN

HALLELUJAH

 AND FROM THE THRONE CAME A VOICE SAYING PRAISE OUR GOD ALL YOU HIS SERVANTS YOU WHO FEAR HIM SMALL AND GREAT

 THEN I HEARD WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE VOICE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE LIKE THE ROAR OF MANY WATERS AND LIKE THE SOUND OF MIGHTY PEALS OF THUNDER CRYING OUT HALLELUJAH

FOR THE LORD OUR GOD THE ALMIGHTY REIGNS

LET US REJOICE AND EXULT AND GIVE HIM THE GLORY FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB HAS COME AND HIS BRIDE HAS MADE HERSELF READY; IT WAS GRANTED HER TO CLOTHE HERSELF WITH FINE LINEN BRIGHT AND PUREFOR THE FINE LINEN IS THE RIGHTEOUS DEEDS OF THE SAINTS

AND THE ANGEL SAID TO ME WRITE THIS BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO ARE INVITED TO THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB

 AND HE SAID TO ME THESE ARE THE TRUE WORDS OF GOD

 THEN I FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET TO WORSHIP HIM BUT HE SAID TO ME YOU MUST NOT DO THAT

I AM A FELLOW SERVANT WITH YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS WHO HOLD TO THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS

WORSHIP GOD

 FOR THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS IS THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY

THEN I SAW HEAVEN OPENED AND BEHOLD A WHITE HORSE

THE ONE SITTING ON IT IS CALLED FAITHFUL AND TRUE AND IN RIGHTEOUSNESS HE JUDGES AND MAKES WAR

HIS EYES ARE LIKE A FLAME OF FIRE AND ON HIS HEAD ARE MANY DIADEMS AND HE HAS A NAME WRITTEN THAT NO ONE KNOWS BUT HIMSELF

HE IS CLOTHED IN A ROBE DIPPED IN BLOOD AND THE NAME BY WHICH HE IS CALLED IS THE WORD OF GOD

AND THE ARMIES OF HEAVEN ARRAYED IN FINE LINEN WHITE AND PURE WERE FOLLOWING HIM ON WHITE HORSES

FROM HIS MOUTH COMES A SHARP SWORD WITH WHICH TO STRIKE DOWN THE NATIONS AND HE WILL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON

HE WILL TREAD THE WINEPRESS OF THE FURY OF THE WRATH OF GOD THE ALMIGHTY

ON HIS ROBE AND ON HIS THIGH HE HAS A NAME WRITTEN KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS

THEN I SAW AN ANGEL STANDING IN THE SUN AND WITH A LOUD VOICE HE CALLED TO ALL THE BIRDS THAT FLY DIRECTLY OVERHEAD COME GATHER FOR THE GREAT SUPPER OF GOD TO EAT THE FLESH OF KINGS THE FLESH OF CAPTAINS THE FLESH OF MIGHTY MEN THE FLESH OF HORSES AND THEIR RIDERS AND THE FLESH OF ALL MEN BOTH FREE AND SLAVE BOTH SMALL AND GREAT

 AND I SAW THE BEAST AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WITH THEIR ARMIES GATHERED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIM WHO WAS SITTING ON THE HORSE AND AGAINST HIS ARMY

AND THE BEAST WAS CAPTURED AND WITH IT THE FALSE PROPHET WHO IN ITS PRESENCE HAD DONE THE SIGNS BY WHICH HE DECEIVED THOSE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND THOSE WHO WORSHIPED ITS IMAGE

THESE TWO WERE THROWN ALIVE INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE THAT BURNS WITH SULFUR

AND THE REST WERE SLAIN BY THE SWORD THAT CAME FROM THE MOUTH OF HIM WHO WAS SITTING ON THE HORSE AND ALL THE BIRDS WERE GORGED WITH THEIR FLESH

THEN I SAW AN ANGEL COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE KEY TO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND A GREAT CHAIN

AND HE SEIZED THE DRAGON THAT ANCIENT SERPENT WHO IS THE DEVIL AND SATAN AND BOUND HIM FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND THREW HIM INTO THE PIT AND SHUT IT AND SEALED IT OVER HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT DECEIVE THE NATIONS ANY LONGER UNTIL THE THOUSAND YEARS WERE ENDED

AFTER THAT HE MUST BE RELEASED FOR A LITTLE WHILE

THEN I SAW THRONES AND SEATED ON THEM WERE THOSE TO WHOM THE AUTHORITY TO JUDGE WAS COMMITTED

ALSO I SAW THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BEHEADED FOR THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS AND FOR THE WORD OF GOD AND WHO HAD NOT WORSHIPED THE BEAST OR ITS IMAGE AND HAD NOT RECEIVED ITS MARK ON THEIR FOREHEADS OR THEIR HANDS

THEY CAME TO LIFE AND REIGNED WITH CHRIST FOR A THOUSAND YEARS

THE REST OF THE DEAD DID NOT COME TO LIFE UNTIL THE THOUSAND YEARS WERE ENDED

THIS IS THE FIRST RESURRECTION

BLESSED AND HOLY IS THE ONE WHO SHARES IN THE FIRST RESURRECTION

OVER SUCH THE SECOND DEATH HAS NO POWER BUT THEY WILL BE PRIESTS OF GOD AND OF CHRIST AND THEY WILL REIGN WITH HIM FOR A THOUSAND YEARS

AND WHEN THE THOUSAND YEARS ARE ENDED SATAN WILL BE RELEASED FROM HIS PRISON AND WILL COME OUT TO DECEIVE THE NATIONS THAT ARE AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH GOG AND MAGOG TO GATHER THEM FOR BATTLE; THEIR NUMBER IS LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA

AND THEY MARCHED UP OVER THE BROAD PLAIN OF THE EARTH AND SURROUNDED THE CAMP OF THE SAINTS AND THE BELOVED CITY BUT FIRE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUMED THEM AND THE DEVIL WHO HAD DECEIVED THEM WAS THROWN INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND SULFUR WHERE THE BEAST AND THE FALSE PROPHET WERE AND THEY WILL BE TORMENTED DAY AND NIGHT FOREVER AND EVER

THEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THRONE AND HIM WHO WAS SEATED ON IT

FROM HIS PRESENCE EARTH AND SKY FLED AWAY AND NO PLACE WAS FOUND FOR THEM

AND I SAW THE DEAD GREAT AND SMALL STANDING BEFORE THE THRONE AND BOOKS WERE OPENED

THEN ANOTHER BOOK WAS OPENED WHICH IS THE BOOK OF LIFE

AND THE DEAD WERE JUDGED BY WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE BOOKS ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY HAD DONE

AND THE SEA GAVE UP THE DEAD WHO WERE IN IT DEATH AND HADES GAVE UP THE DEAD WHO WERE IN THEM AND THEY WERE JUDGED EACH ONE OF THEM ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY HAD DONE

THEN DEATH AND HADES WERE THROWN INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE

THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH THE LAKE OF FIRE

AND IF ANYONE'S NAME WAS NOT FOUND WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE HE WAS THROWN INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE

THEN I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH FOR THE FIRST HEAVEN AND THE FIRST EARTH HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SEA WAS NO MORE

AND I SAW THE HOLY CITY NEW JERUSALEM COMING DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN FROM GOD PREPARED AS A BRIDE ADORNED FOR HER HUSBAND

AND I HEARD A LOUD VOICE FROM THE THRONE SAYING BEHOLD THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD IS WITH MAN

HE WILL DWELL WITH THEM AND THEY WILL BE HIS PEOPLE AND GOD HIMSELF WILL BE WITH THEM AS THEIR GOD

HE WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES AND DEATH SHALL BE NO MORE NEITHER SHALL THERE BE MOURNING NOR CRYING NOR PAIN ANYMORE FOR THE FORMER THINGS HAVE PASSED AWAY

 AND HE WHO WAS SEATED ON THE THRONE SAID BEHOLD I AM MAKING ALL THINGS NEW

 ALSO HE SAID WRITE THIS DOWN FOR THESE WORDS ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND TRUE

 AND HE SAID TO ME IT IS DONE

I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA THE BEGINNING AND THE END

TO THE THIRSTY I WILL GIVE FROM THE SPRING OF THE WATER OF LIFE WITHOUT PAYMENT

THE ONE WHO CONQUERS WILL HAVE THIS HERITAGE AND I WILL BE HIS GOD AND HE WILL BE MY SON

BUT AS FOR THE COWARDLY THE FAITHLESS THE DETESTABLE AS FOR MURDERERS THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL SORCERERS IDOLATERS AND ALL LIARS THEIR PORTION WILL BE IN THE LAKE THAT BURNS WITH FIRE AND SULFUR WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH

 THEN CAME ONE OF THE SEVEN ANGELS WHO HAD THE SEVEN BOWLS FULL OF THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES AND SPOKE TO ME SAYING COME I WILL SHOW YOU THE BRIDE THE WIFE OF THE LAMB

 AND HE CARRIED ME AWAY IN THE SPIRIT TO A GREAT HIGH MOUNTAIN AND SHOWED ME THE HOLY CITY JERUSALEM COMING DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN FROM GOD HAVING THE GLORY OF GOD ITS RADIANCE LIKE A MOST RARE JEWEL LIKE A JASPER CLEAR AS CRYSTAL

IT HAD A GREAT HIGH WALL WITH TWELVE GATES AND AT THE GATES TWELVE ANGELS AND ON THE GATES THE NAMES OF THE TWELVE TRIBES OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL WERE INSCRIBED ON THE EAST THREE GATES ON THE NORTH THREE GATES ON THE SOUTH THREE GATES AND ON THE WEST THREE GATES

AND THE WALL OF THE CITY HAD TWELVE FOUNDATIONS AND ON THEM WERE THE TWELVE NAMES OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES OF THE LAMB

AND THE ONE WHO SPOKE WITH ME HAD A MEASURING ROD OF GOLD TO MEASURE THE CITY AND ITS GATES AND WALLS

THE CITY LIES FOURSQUARE; ITS LENGTH THE SAME AS ITS WIDTH

AND HE MEASURED THE CITY WITH HIS ROD  STADIA

ITS LENGTH AND WIDTH AND HEIGHT ARE EQUAL

HE ALSO MEASURED ITS WALL  CUBITS BY HUMAN MEASUREMENT WHICH IS ALSO AN ANGEL'S MEASUREMENT

THE WALL WAS BUILT OF JASPER WHILE THE CITY WAS PURE GOLD CLEAR AS GLASS

THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WALL OF THE CITY WERE ADORNED WITH EVERY KIND OF JEWEL

THE FIRST WAS JASPER THE SECOND SAPPHIRE THE THIRD AGATE THE FOURTH EMERALD THE FIFTH ONYX THE SIXTH CARNELIAN THE SEVENTH CHRYSOLITE THE EIGHTH BERYL THE NINTH TOPAZ THE TENTH CHRYSOPRASE THE ELEVENTH JACINTH THE TWELFTH AMETHYST

AND THE TWELVE GATES WERE TWELVE PEARLS EACH OF THE GATES MADE OF A SINGLE PEARL AND THE STREET OF THE CITY WAS PURE GOLD TRANSPARENT AS GLASS

AND I SAW NO TEMPLE IN THE CITY FOR ITS TEMPLE IS THE LORD GOD THE ALMIGHTY AND THE LAMB

AND THE CITY HAS NO NEED OF SUN OR MOON TO SHINE ON IT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD GIVES IT LIGHT AND ITS LAMP IS THE LAMB

BY ITS LIGHT WILL THE NATIONS WALK AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WILL BRING THEIR GLORY INTO IT AND ITS GATES WILL NEVER BE SHUT BY DAYAND THERE WILL BE NO NIGHT THERE

THEY WILL BRING INTO IT THE GLORY AND THE HONOR OF THE NATIONS

BUT NOTHING UNCLEAN WILL EVER ENTER IT NOR ANYONE WHO DOES WHAT IS DETESTABLE OR FALSE BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE

THEN THE ANGEL SHOWED ME THE RIVER OF THE WATER OF LIFE BRIGHT AS CRYSTAL FLOWING FROM THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET OF THE CITY; ALSO ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER THE TREE OF LIFE WITH ITS TWELVE KINDS OF FRUIT YIELDING ITS FRUIT EACH MONTH

THE LEAVES OF THE TREE WERE FOR THE HEALING OF THE NATIONS

NO LONGER WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ACCURSED BUT THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB WILL BE IN IT AND HIS SERVANTS WILL WORSHIP HIM

THEY WILL SEE HIS FACE AND HIS NAME WILL BE ON THEIR FOREHEADS

AND NIGHT WILL BE NO MORE

THEY WILL NEED NO LIGHT OF LAMP OR SUN FOR THE LORD GOD WILL BE THEIR LIGHT AND THEY WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER

AND HE SAID TO ME THESE WORDS ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND TRUE

AND THE LORD THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF THE PROPHETS HAS SENT HIS ANGEL TO SHOW HIS SERVANTS WHAT MUST SOON TAKE PLACE

 AND BEHOLD I AM COMING SOON

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO KEEPS THE WORDS OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK

 I JOHN AM THE ONE WHO HEARD AND SAW THESE THINGS

AND WHEN I HEARD AND SAW THEM I FELL DOWN TO WORSHIP AT THE FEET OF THE ANGEL WHO SHOWED THEM TO ME BUT HE SAID TO ME YOU MUST NOT DO THAT

I AM A FELLOW SERVANT WITH YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS THE PROPHETS AND WITH THOSE WHO KEEP THE WORDS OF THIS BOOK

WORSHIP GOD

 AND HE SAID TO ME DO NOT SEAL UP THE WORDS OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK FOR THE TIME IS NEAR

LET THE EVILDOER STILL DO EVIL AND THE FILTHY STILL BE FILTHY AND THE RIGHTEOUS STILL DO RIGHT AND THE HOLY STILL BE HOLY

 BEHOLD I AM COMING SOON BRINGING MY RECOMPENSE WITH ME TO REPAY EVERYONE FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE

I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA THE FIRST AND THE LAST THE BEGINNING AND THE END

 BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO WASH THEIR ROBES SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE AND THAT THEY MAY ENTER THE CITY BY THE GATES

OUTSIDE ARE THE DOGS AND SORCERERS AND THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL AND MURDERERS AND IDOLATERS AND EVERYONE WHO LOVES AND PRACTICES FALSEHOOD

I JESUS HAVE SENT MY ANGEL TO TESTIFY TO YOU ABOUT THESE THINGS FOR THE CHURCHES

I AM THE ROOT AND THE DESCENDANT OF DAVID THE BRIGHT MORNING STAR

DEUTERONOMYTHESE ARE THE WORDS THAT MOSES SPOKE TO ALL ISRAEL BEYOND THE JORDAN IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE ARABAH OPPOSITE SUPH BETWEEN PARAN AND TOPHEL LABAN HAZEROTH AND DIZAHAB

IT IS ELEVEN DAYS' JOURNEY FROM HOREB BY THE WAY OF MOUNT SEIR TO KADESHBARNEA

IN THE FORTIETH YEAR ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE ELEVENTH MONTH MOSES SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD HAD GIVEN HIM IN COMMANDMENT TO THEM AFTER HE HAD DEFEATED SIHON THE KING OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED IN HESHBON AND OG THE KING OF BASHAN WHO LIVED IN ASHTAROTH AND IN EDREI

BEYOND THE JORDAN IN THE LAND OF MOAB MOSES UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN THIS LAW SAYING THE LORD OUR GOD SAID TO US IN HOREB 'YOU HAVE STAYED LONG ENOUGH AT THIS MOUNTAIN

TURN AND TAKE YOUR JOURNEY AND GO TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES AND TO ALL THEIR NEIGHBORS IN THE ARABAH IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND IN THE LOWLAND AND IN THE NEGEB AND BY THE SEACOAST THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES AND LEBANON AS FAR AS THE GREAT RIVER THE RIVER EUPHRATES

SEE I HAVE SET THE LAND BEFORE YOU

GO IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB TO GIVE TO THEM AND TO THEIR OFFSPRING AFTER THEM

' AT THAT TIME I SAID TO YOU 'I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR YOU BY MYSELF

THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS MULTIPLIED YOU AND BEHOLD YOU ARE TODAY AS NUMEROUS AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN

MAY THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS MAKE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES AS MANY AS YOU ARE AND BLESS YOU AS HE HAS PROMISED YOU

HOW CAN I BEAR BY MYSELF THE WEIGHT AND BURDEN OF YOU AND YOUR STRIFE

CHOOSE FOR YOUR TRIBES WISE UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I WILL APPOINT THEM AS YOUR HEADS

' AND YOU ANSWERED ME 'THE THING THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN IS GOOD FOR US TO DO

' SO I TOOK THE HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND SET THEM AS HEADS OVER YOU COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS COMMANDERS OF FIFTIES COMMANDERS OF TENS AND OFFICERS THROUGHOUT YOUR TRIBES

AND I CHARGED YOUR JUDGES AT THAT TIME 'HEAR THE CASES BETWEEN YOUR BROTHERS AND JUDGE RIGHTEOUSLY BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS BROTHER OR THE ALIEN WHO IS WITH HIM

YOU SHALL NOT BE PARTIAL IN JUDGMENT

YOU SHALL HEAR THE SMALL AND THE GREAT ALIKE

YOU SHALL NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY ANYONE FOR THE JUDGMENT IS GOD'S

AND THE CASE THAT IS TOO HARD FOR YOU YOU SHALL BRING TO ME AND I WILL HEAR IT

' AND I COMMANDED YOU AT THAT TIME ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO

THEN WE SET OUT FROM HOREB AND WENT THROUGH ALL THAT GREAT AND TERRIFYING WILDERNESS THAT YOU SAW ON THE WAY TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES AS THE LORD OUR GOD COMMANDED US

AND WE CAME TO KADESHBARNEA

AND I SAID TO YOU 'YOU HAVE COME TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES WHICH THE LORD OUR GOD IS GIVING US

SEE THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS SET THE LAND BEFORE YOU

GO UP TAKE POSSESSION AS THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS HAS TOLD YOU

DO NOT FEAR OR BE DISMAYED

' THEN ALL OF YOU CAME NEAR ME AND SAID 'LET US SEND MEN BEFORE US THAT THEY MAY EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US AND BRING US WORD AGAIN OF THE WAY BY WHICH WE MUST GO UP AND THE CITIES INTO WHICH WE SHALL COME

' THE THING SEEMED GOOD TO ME AND I TOOK TWELVE MEN FROM YOU ONE MAN FROM EACH TRIBE

AND THEY TURNED AND WENT UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY AND CAME TO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL AND SPIED IT OUT

AND THEY TOOK IN THEIR HANDS SOME OF THE FRUIT OF THE LAND AND BROUGHT IT DOWN TO US AND BROUGHT US WORD AGAIN AND SAID 'IT IS A GOOD LAND THAT THE LORD OUR GOD IS GIVING US

' YET YOU WOULD NOT GO UP BUT REBELLED AGAINST THE COMMAND OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

AND YOU MURMURED IN YOUR TENTS AND SAID 'BECAUSE THE LORD HATED US HE HAS BROUGHT US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO GIVE US INTO THE HAND OF THE AMORITES TO DESTROY US

WHERE ARE WE GOING UP

OUR BROTHERS HAVE MADE OUR HEARTS MELT SAYING THE PEOPLE ARE GREATER AND TALLER THAN WE

THE CITIES ARE GREAT AND FORTIFIED UP TO HEAVEN

AND BESIDES WE HAVE SEEN THE SONS OF THE ANAKIM THERE

' THEN I SAID TO YOU 'DO NOT BE IN DREAD OR AFRAID OF THEM

THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO GOES BEFORE YOU WILL HIMSELF FIGHT FOR YOU JUST AS HE DID FOR YOU IN EGYPT BEFORE YOUR EYES AND IN THE WILDERNESS WHERE YOU HAVE SEEN HOW THE LORD YOUR GOD CARRIED YOU AS A MAN CARRIES HIS SON ALL THE WAY THAT YOU WENT UNTIL YOU CAME TO THIS PLACE

' YET IN SPITE OF THIS WORD YOU DID NOT BELIEVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO WENT BEFORE YOU IN THE WAY TO SEEK YOU OUT A PLACE TO PITCH YOUR TENTS IN FIRE BY NIGHT AND IN THE CLOUD BY DAY TO SHOW YOU BY WHAT WAY YOU SHOULD GO

AND THE LORD HEARD YOUR WORDS AND WAS ANGERED AND HE SWORE 'NOT ONE OF THESE MEN OF THIS EVIL GENERATION SHALL SEE THE GOOD LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS EXCEPT CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH

HE SHALL SEE IT AND TO HIM AND TO HIS CHILDREN I WILL GIVE THE LAND ON WHICH HE HAS TRODDEN BECAUSE HE HAS WHOLLY FOLLOWED THE LORD

' EVEN WITH ME THE LORD WAS ANGRY ON YOUR ACCOUNT AND SAID 'YOU ALSO SHALL NOT GO IN THERE

JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN WHO STANDS BEFORE YOU HE SHALL ENTER

ENCOURAGE HIM FOR HE SHALL CAUSE ISRAEL TO INHERIT IT

AND AS FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES WHO YOU SAID WOULD BECOME A PREY AND YOUR CHILDREN WHO TODAY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD OR EVIL THEY SHALL GO IN THERE

AND TO THEM I WILL GIVE IT AND THEY SHALL POSSESS IT

BUT AS FOR YOU TURN AND JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RED SEA

' THEN YOU ANSWERED ME 'WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD

WE OURSELVES WILL GO UP AND FIGHT JUST AS THE LORD OUR GOD COMMANDED US

' AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FASTENED ON HIS WEAPONS OF WAR AND THOUGHT IT EASY TO GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'SAY TO THEM DO NOT GO UP OR FIGHT FOR I AM NOT IN YOUR MIDST LEST YOU BE DEFEATED BEFORE YOUR ENEMIES

' SO I SPOKE TO YOU AND YOU WOULD NOT LISTEN; BUT YOU REBELLED AGAINST THE COMMAND OF THE LORD AND PRESUMPTUOUSLY WENT UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY

THEN THE AMORITES WHO LIVED IN THAT HILL COUNTRY CAME OUT AGAINST YOU AND CHASED YOU AS BEES DO AND BEAT YOU DOWN IN SEIR AS FAR AS HORMAH

AND YOU RETURNED AND WEPT BEFORE THE LORD BUT THE LORD DID NOT LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE OR GIVE EAR TO YOU

SO YOU REMAINED AT KADESH MANY DAYS THE DAYS THAT YOU REMAINED THERE

THEN WE TURNED AND JOURNEYED INTO THE WILDERNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RED SEA AS THE LORD TOLD ME

AND FOR MANY DAYS WE TRAVELED AROUND MOUNT SEIR

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME 'YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THIS MOUNTAIN COUNTRY LONG ENOUGH

TURN NORTHWARD AND COMMAND THE PEOPLE YOU ARE ABOUT TO PASS THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF YOUR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF ESAU WHO LIVE IN SEIR; AND THEY WILL BE AFRAID OF YOU

SO BE VERY CAREFUL

DO NOT CONTEND WITH THEM FOR I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY OF THEIR LAND NO NOT SO MUCH AS FOR THE SOLE OF THE FOOT TO TREAD ON BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN MOUNT SEIR TO ESAU AS A POSSESSION

YOU SHALL PURCHASE FOOD FROM THEM FOR MONEY THAT YOU MAY EAT AND YOU SHALL ALSO BUY WATER OF THEM FOR MONEY THAT YOU MAY DRINK

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS BLESSED YOU IN ALL THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

HE KNOWS YOUR GOING THROUGH THIS GREAT WILDERNESS

THESE FORTY YEARS THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS BEEN WITH YOU

YOU HAVE LACKED NOTHING

' SO WE WENT ON AWAY FROM OUR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF ESAU WHO LIVE IN SEIR AWAY FROM THE ARABAH ROAD FROM ELATH AND EZIONGEBER

AND WE TURNED AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WILDERNESS OF MOAB

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'DO NOT HARASS MOAB OR CONTEND WITH THEM IN BATTLE FOR I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY OF THEIR LAND FOR A POSSESSION BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN AR TO THE PEOPLE OF LOT FOR A POSSESSION

' THE EMIM FORMERLY LIVED THERE A PEOPLE GREAT AND MANY AND TALL AS THE ANAKIM

LIKE THE ANAKIM THEY ARE ALSO COUNTED AS REPHAIM BUT THE MOABITES CALL THEM EMIM

THE HORITES ALSO LIVED IN SEIR FORMERLY BUT THE PEOPLE OF ESAU DISPOSSESSED THEM AND DESTROYED THEM FROM BEFORE THEM AND SETTLED IN THEIR PLACE AS ISRAEL DID TO THE LAND OF THEIR POSSESSION WHICH THE LORD GAVE TO THEM

 'NOW RISE UP AND GO OVER THE BROOK ZERED

' SO WE WENT OVER THE BROOK ZERED

AND THE TIME FROM OUR LEAVING KADESHBARNEA UNTIL WE CROSSED THE BROOK ZERED WAS THIRTYEIGHT YEARS UNTIL THE ENTIRE GENERATION THAT IS THE MEN OF WAR HAD PERISHED FROM THE CAMP AS THE LORD HAD SWORN TO THEM

FOR INDEED THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS AGAINST THEM TO DESTROY THEM FROM THE CAMP UNTIL THEY HAD PERISHED

SO AS SOON AS ALL THE MEN OF WAR HAD PERISHED AND WERE DEAD FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE THE LORD SAID TO ME 'TODAY YOU ARE TO CROSS THE BORDER OF MOAB AT AR

AND WHEN YOU APPROACH THE TERRITORY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMMON DO NOT HARASS THEM OR CONTEND WITH THEM FOR I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY OF THE LAND OF THE PEOPLE OF AMMON AS A POSSESSION BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN IT TO THE SONS OF LOT FOR A POSSESSION

' IT IS ALSO COUNTED AS A LAND OF REPHAIM

REPHAIM FORMERLY LIVED THEREBUT THE AMMONITES CALL THEM ZAMZUMMIM A PEOPLE GREAT AND MANY AND TALL AS THE ANAKIM; BUT THE LORD DESTROYED THEM BEFORE THE AMMONITES AND THEY DISPOSSESSED THEM AND SETTLED IN THEIR PLACE AS HE DID FOR THE PEOPLE OF ESAU WHO LIVE IN SEIR WHEN HE DESTROYED THE HORITES BEFORE THEM AND THEY DISPOSSESSED THEM AND SETTLED IN THEIR PLACE EVEN TO THIS DAY

AS FOR THE AVVIM WHO LIVED IN VILLAGES AS FAR AS GAZA THE CAPHTORIM WHO CAME FROM CAPHTOR DESTROYED THEM AND SETTLED IN THEIR PLACE

 'RISE UP SET OUT ON YOUR JOURNEY AND GO OVER THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON

BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN INTO YOUR HAND SIHON THE AMORITE KING OF HESHBON AND HIS LAND

BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION AND CONTEND WITH HIM IN BATTLE

THIS DAY I WILL BEGIN TO PUT THE DREAD AND FEAR OF YOU ON THE PEOPLES WHO ARE UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN WHO SHALL HEAR THE REPORT OF YOU AND SHALL TREMBLE AND BE IN ANGUISH BECAUSE OF YOU

' SO I SENT MESSENGERS FROM THE WILDERNESS OF KEDEMOTH TO SIHON THE KING OF HESHBON WITH WORDS OF PEACE SAYING 'LET ME PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND

I WILL GO ONLY BY THE ROAD; I WILL TURN ASIDE NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT

YOU SHALL SELL ME FOOD FOR MONEY THAT I MAY EAT AND GIVE ME WATER FOR MONEY THAT I MAY DRINK

ONLY LET ME PASS THROUGH ON FOOT AS THE SONS OF ESAU WHO LIVE IN SEIR AND THE MOABITES WHO LIVE IN AR DID FOR ME UNTIL I GO OVER THE JORDAN INTO THE LAND THAT THE LORD OUR GOD IS GIVING TO US

' BUT SIHON THE KING OF HESHBON WOULD NOT LET US PASS BY HIM FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD HARDENED HIS SPIRIT AND MADE HIS HEART OBSTINATE THAT HE MIGHT GIVE HIM INTO YOUR HAND AS HE IS THIS DAY

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'BEHOLD I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON AND HIS LAND OVER TO YOU

BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION THAT YOU MAY OCCUPY HIS LAND

' THEN SIHON CAME OUT AGAINST US HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE TO BATTLE AT JAHAZ

AND THE LORD OUR GOD GAVE HIM OVER TO US AND WE DEFEATED HIM AND HIS SONS AND ALL HIS PEOPLE

AND WE CAPTURED ALL HIS CITIES AT THAT TIME AND DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION EVERY CITY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN

WE LEFT NO SURVIVORS

ONLY THE LIVESTOCK WE TOOK AS SPOIL FOR OURSELVES WITH THE PLUNDER OF THE CITIES THAT WE CAPTURED

FROM AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AND FROM THE CITY THAT IS IN THE VALLEY AS FAR AS GILEAD THERE WAS NOT A CITY TOO HIGH FOR US

THE LORD OUR GOD GAVE ALL INTO OUR HANDS

ONLY TO THE LAND OF THE SONS OF AMMON YOU DID NOT DRAW NEAR THAT IS TO ALL THE BANKS OF THE RIVER JABBOK AND THE CITIES OF THE HILL COUNTRY WHATEVER THE LORD OUR GOD HAD FORBIDDEN US

THEN WE TURNED AND WENT UP THE WAY TO BASHAN

AND OG THE KING OF BASHAN CAME OUT AGAINST US HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE TO BATTLE AT EDREI

BUT THE LORD SAID TO ME 'DO NOT FEAR HIM FOR I HAVE GIVEN HIM AND ALL HIS PEOPLE AND HIS LAND INTO YOUR HAND

AND YOU SHALL DO TO HIM AS YOU DID TO SIHON THE KING OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED AT HESHBON

' SO THE LORD OUR GOD GAVE INTO OUR HAND OG ALSO THE KING OF BASHAN AND ALL HIS PEOPLE AND WE STRUCK HIM DOWN UNTIL HE HAD NO SURVIVOR LEFT

AND WE TOOK ALL HIS CITIES AT THAT TIMETHERE WAS NOT A CITY THAT WE DID NOT TAKE FROM THEMSIXTY CITIES THE WHOLE REGION OF ARGOB THE KINGDOM OF OG IN BASHAN

ALL THESE WERE CITIES FORTIFIED WITH HIGH WALLS GATES AND BARS BESIDES VERY MANY UNWALLED VILLAGES

AND WE DEVOTED THEM TO DESTRUCTION AS WE DID TO SIHON THE KING OF HESHBON DEVOTING TO DESTRUCTION EVERY CITY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN

BUT ALL THE LIVESTOCK AND THE SPOIL OF THE CITIES WE TOOK AS OUR PLUNDER

SO WE TOOK THE LAND AT THAT TIME OUT OF THE HAND OF THE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN FROM THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON TO MOUNT HERMON THE SIDONIANS CALL HERMON SIRION WHILE THE AMORITES CALL IT SENIR ALL THE CITIES OF THE TABLELAND AND ALL GILEAD AND ALL BASHAN AS FAR AS SALECAH AND EDREI CITIES OF THE KINGDOM OF OG IN BASHAN

FOR ONLY OG THE KING OF BASHAN WAS LEFT OF THE REMNANT OF THE REPHAIM

BEHOLD HIS BED WAS A BED OF IRON

IS IT NOT IN RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES

NINE CUBITS WAS ITS LENGTH AND FOUR CUBITS ITS BREADTH ACCORDING TO THE COMMON CUBIT

 WHEN WE TOOK POSSESSION OF THIS LAND AT THAT TIME I GAVE TO THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES THE TERRITORY BEGINNING AT AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AND HALF THE HILL COUNTRY OF GILEAD WITH ITS CITIES

THE REST OF GILEAD AND ALL BASHAN THE KINGDOM OF OG THAT IS ALL THE REGION OF ARGOB I GAVE TO THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH

ALL THAT PORTION OF BASHAN IS CALLED THE LAND OF REPHAIM

JAIR THE MANASSITE TOOK ALL THE REGION OF ARGOB THAT IS BASHAN AS FAR AS THE BORDER OF THE GESHURITES AND THE MAACATHITES AND CALLED THE VILLAGES AFTER HIS OWN NAME HAVVOTHJAIR AS IT IS TO THIS DAY

 TO MACHIR I GAVE GILEAD AND TO THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES I GAVE THE TERRITORY FROM GILEAD AS FAR AS THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON WITH THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY AS A BORDER AS FAR OVER AS THE RIVER JABBOK THE BORDER OF THE AMMONITES; THE ARABAH ALSO WITH THE JORDAN AS THE BORDER FROM CHINNERETH AS FAR AS THE SEA OF THE ARABAH THE SALT SEA UNDER THE SLOPES OF PISGAH ON THE EAST

AND I COMMANDED YOU AT THAT TIME SAYING 'THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THIS LAND TO POSSESS

ALL YOUR MEN OF VALOR SHALL CROSS OVER ARMED BEFORE YOUR BROTHERS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

ONLY YOUR WIVES YOUR LITTLE ONES AND YOUR LIVESTOCK I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MUCH LIVESTOCK SHALL REMAIN IN THE CITIES THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU UNTIL THE LORD GIVES REST TO YOUR BROTHERS AS TO YOU AND THEY ALSO OCCUPY THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD GIVES THEM BEYOND THE JORDAN

THEN EACH OF YOU MAY RETURN TO HIS POSSESSION WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU

' AND I COMMANDED JOSHUA AT THAT TIME 'YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN ALL THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS DONE TO THESE TWO KINGS

SO WILL THE LORD DO TO ALL THE KINGDOMS INTO WHICH YOU ARE CROSSING

YOU SHALL NOT FEAR THEM FOR IT IS THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO FIGHTS FOR YOU

' AND I PLEADED WITH THE LORD AT THAT TIME SAYING 'O LORD GOD YOU HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO SHOW YOUR SERVANT YOUR GREATNESS AND YOUR MIGHTY HAND

FOR WHAT GOD IS THERE IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTH WHO CAN DO SUCH WORKS AND MIGHTY ACTS AS YOURS

PLEASE LET ME GO OVER AND SEE THE GOOD LAND BEYOND THE JORDAN THAT GOOD HILL COUNTRY AND LEBANON

' BUT THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU AND WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'ENOUGH FROM YOU; DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THIS MATTER AGAIN

GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH AND LIFT UP YOUR EYES WESTWARD AND NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD AND LOOK AT IT WITH YOUR EYES FOR YOU SHALL NOT GO OVER THIS JORDAN

BUT CHARGE JOSHUA AND ENCOURAGE AND STRENGTHEN HIM FOR HE SHALL GO OVER AT THE HEAD OF THIS PEOPLE AND HE SHALL PUT THEM IN POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT YOU SHALL SEE

' SO WE REMAINED IN THE VALLEY OPPOSITE BETHPEOR

AND NOW O ISRAEL LISTEN TO THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT I AM TEACHING YOU AND DO THEM THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND GO IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS IS GIVING YOU

YOU SHALL NOT ADD TO THE WORD THAT I COMMAND YOU NOR TAKE FROM IT THAT YOU MAY KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT I COMMAND YOU

YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN WHAT THE LORD DID AT BAALPEOR FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD DESTROYED FROM AMONG YOU ALL THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED THE BAAL OF PEOR

BUT YOU WHO HELD FAST TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY

SEE I HAVE TAUGHT YOU STATUTES AND RULES AS THE LORD MY GOD COMMANDED ME THAT YOU SHOULD DO THEM IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT

KEEP THEM AND DO THEM FOR THAT WILL BE YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLES WHO WHEN THEY HEAR ALL THESE STATUTES WILL SAY 'SURELY THIS GREAT NATION IS A WISE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE

' FOR WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE THAT HAS A GOD SO NEAR TO IT AS THE LORD OUR GOD IS TO US WHENEVER WE CALL UPON HIM

AND WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE THAT HAS STATUTES AND RULES SO RIGHTEOUS AS ALL THIS LAW THAT I SET BEFORE YOU TODAY

ONLY TAKE CARE AND KEEP YOUR SOUL DILIGENTLY LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN AND LEST THEY DEPART FROM YOUR HEART ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE

MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN HOW ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB THE LORD SAID TO ME 'GATHER THE PEOPLE TO ME THAT I MAY LET THEM HEAR MY WORDS SO THAT THEY MAY LEARN TO FEAR ME ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY LIVE ON THE EARTH AND THAT THEY MAY TEACH THEIR CHILDREN SO

' AND YOU CAME NEAR AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WHILE THE MOUNTAIN BURNED WITH FIRE TO THE HEART OF HEAVEN WRAPPED IN DARKNESS CLOUD AND GLOOM

THEN THE LORD SPOKE TO YOU OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE

YOU HEARD THE SOUND OF WORDS BUT SAW NO FORM; THERE WAS ONLY A VOICE

AND HE DECLARED TO YOU HIS COVENANT WHICH HE COMMANDED YOU TO PERFORM THAT IS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AND HE WROTE THEM ON TWO TABLETS OF STONE

AND THE LORD COMMANDED ME AT THAT TIME TO TEACH YOU STATUTES AND RULES THAT YOU MIGHT DO THEM IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER TO POSSESS

THEREFORE WATCH YOURSELVES VERY CAREFULLY

SINCE YOU SAW NO FORM ON THE DAY THAT THE LORD SPOKE TO YOU AT HOREB OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE BEWARE LEST YOU ACT CORRUPTLY BY MAKING A CARVED IMAGE FOR YOURSELVES IN THE FORM OF ANY FIGURE THE LIKENESS OF MALE OR FEMALE THE LIKENESS OF ANY ANIMAL THAT IS ON THE EARTH THE LIKENESS OF ANY WINGED BIRD THAT FLIES IN THE AIR THE LIKENESS OF ANYTHING THAT CREEPS ON THE GROUND THE LIKENESS OF ANY FISH THAT IS IN THE WATER UNDER THE EARTH

AND BEWARE LEST YOU RAISE YOUR EYES TO HEAVEN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN YOU BE DRAWN AWAY AND BOW DOWN TO THEM AND SERVE THEM THINGS THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS ALLOTTED TO ALL THE PEOPLES UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN

BUT THE LORD HAS TAKEN YOU AND BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE IRON FURNACE OUT OF EGYPT TO BE A PEOPLE OF HIS OWN INHERITANCE AS YOU ARE THIS DAY

FURTHERMORE THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU AND HE SWORE THAT I SHOULD NOT CROSS THE JORDAN AND THAT I SHOULD NOT ENTER THE GOOD LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU FOR AN INHERITANCE

FOR I MUST DIE IN THIS LAND; I MUST NOT GO OVER THE JORDAN

BUT YOU SHALL GO OVER AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THAT GOOD LAND

TAKE CARE LEST YOU FORGET THE COVENANT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WHICH HE MADE WITH YOU AND MAKE A CARVED IMAGE THE FORM OF ANYTHING THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS FORBIDDEN YOU

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE A JEALOUS GOD

WHEN YOU FATHER CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND HAVE GROWN OLD IN THE LAND IF YOU ACT CORRUPTLY BY MAKING A CARVED IMAGE IN THE FORM OF ANYTHING AND BY DOING WHAT IS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD SO AS TO PROVOKE HIM TO ANGER I CALL HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY THAT YOU WILL SOON UTTERLY PERISH FROM THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER THE JORDAN TO POSSESS

YOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG IN IT BUT WILL BE UTTERLY DESTROYED

AND THE LORD WILL SCATTER YOU AMONG THE PEOPLES AND YOU WILL BE LEFT FEW IN NUMBER AMONG THE NATIONS WHERE THE LORD WILL DRIVE YOU

AND THERE YOU WILL SERVE GODS OF WOOD AND STONE THE WORK OF HUMAN HANDS THAT NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR NOR EAT NOR SMELL

BUT FROM THERE YOU WILL SEEK THE LORD YOUR GOD AND YOU WILL FIND HIM IF YOU SEARCH AFTER HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL

WHEN YOU ARE IN TRIBULATION AND ALL THESE THINGS COME UPON YOU IN THE LATTER DAYS YOU WILL RETURN TO THE LORD YOUR GOD AND OBEY HIS VOICE

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A MERCIFUL GOD

HE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU OR DESTROY YOU OR FORGET THE COVENANT WITH YOUR FATHERS THAT HE SWORE TO THEM

FOR ASK NOW OF THE DAYS THAT ARE PAST WHICH WERE BEFORE YOU SINCE THE DAY THAT GOD CREATED MAN ON THE EARTH AND ASK FROM ONE END OF HEAVEN TO THE OTHER WHETHER SUCH A GREAT THING AS THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED OR WAS EVER HEARD OF

DID ANY PEOPLE EVER HEAR THE VOICE OF A GOD SPEAKING OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE AS YOU HAVE HEARD AND STILL LIVE

OR HAS ANY GOD EVER ATTEMPTED TO GO AND TAKE A NATION FOR HIMSELF FROM THE MIDST OF ANOTHER NATION BY TRIALS BY SIGNS BY WONDERS AND BY WAR BY A MIGHTY HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND BY GREAT DEEDS OF TERROR ALL OF WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD DID FOR YOU IN EGYPT BEFORE YOUR EYES

TO YOU IT WAS SHOWN THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT THE LORD IS GOD; THERE IS NO OTHER BESIDES HIM

OUT OF HEAVEN HE LET YOU HEAR HIS VOICE THAT HE MIGHT DISCIPLINE YOU

AND ON EARTH HE LET YOU SEE HIS GREAT FIRE AND YOU HEARD HIS WORDS OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE

AND BECAUSE HE LOVED YOUR FATHERS AND CHOSE THEIR OFFSPRING AFTER THEM AND BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT WITH HIS OWN PRESENCE BY HIS GREAT POWER DRIVING OUT BEFORE YOU NATIONS GREATER AND MIGHTIER THAN YOURSELVES TO BRING YOU IN TO GIVE YOU THEIR LAND FOR AN INHERITANCE AS IT IS THIS DAY KNOW THEREFORE TODAY AND LAY IT TO YOUR HEART THAT THE LORD IS GOD IN HEAVEN ABOVE AND ON THE EARTH BENEATH; THERE IS NO OTHER

THEREFORE YOU SHALL KEEP HIS STATUTES AND HIS COMMANDMENTS WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR CHILDREN AFTER YOU AND THAT YOU MAY PROLONG YOUR DAYS IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU FOR ALL TIME

 THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES IN THE EAST BEYOND THE JORDAN THAT THE MANSLAYER MIGHT FLEE THERE ANYONE WHO KILLS HIS NEIGHBOR UNINTENTIONALLY WITHOUT BEING AT ENMITY WITH HIM IN TIME PAST; HE MAY FLEE TO ONE OF THESE CITIES AND SAVE HIS LIFE BEZER IN THE WILDERNESS ON THE TABLELAND FOR THE REUBENITES RAMOTH IN GILEAD FOR THE GADITES AND GOLAN IN BASHAN FOR THE MANASSITES

THIS IS THE LAW THAT MOSES SET BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THESE ARE THE TESTIMONIES THE STATUTES AND THE RULES WHICH MOSES SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF EGYPT BEYOND THE JORDAN IN THE VALLEY OPPOSITE BETHPEOR IN THE LAND OF SIHON THE KING OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED AT HESHBON WHOM MOSES AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEFEATED WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF EGYPT

AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS LAND AND THE LAND OF OG THE KING OF BASHAN THE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED TO THE EAST BEYOND THE JORDAN; FROM AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AS FAR AS MOUNT SIRION THAT IS HERMON TOGETHER WITH ALL THE ARABAH ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE JORDAN AS FAR AS THE SEA OF THE ARABAH UNDER THE SLOPES OF PISGAH

AND MOSES SUMMONED ALL ISRAEL AND SAID TO THEM HEAR O ISRAEL THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT I SPEAK IN YOUR HEARING TODAY AND YOU SHALL LEARN THEM AND BE CAREFUL TO DO THEM

THE LORD OUR GOD MADE A COVENANT WITH US IN HOREB

NOT WITH OUR FATHERS DID THE LORD MAKE THIS COVENANT BUT WITH US WHO ARE ALL OF US HERE ALIVE TODAY

THE LORD SPOKE WITH YOU FACE TO FACE AT THE MOUNTAIN OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE WHILE I STOOD BETWEEN THE LORD AND YOU AT THAT TIME TO DECLARE TO YOU THE WORD OF THE LORD

FOR YOU WERE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE FIRE AND YOU DID NOT GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN

HE SAID 'I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY

'YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME

'YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF A CARVED IMAGE OR ANY LIKENESS OF ANYTHING THAT IS IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR THAT IS ON THE EARTH BENEATH OR THAT IS IN THE WATER UNDER THE EARTH

YOU SHALL NOT BOW DOWN TO THEM OR SERVE THEM; FOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS ON THE CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION OF THOSE WHO HATE ME BUT SHOWING STEADFAST LOVE TO THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO LOVE ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS

'YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN FOR THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS WHO TAKES HIS NAME IN VAIN

'OBSERVE THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY AS THE LORD YOUR GOD COMMANDED YOU

SIX DAYS YOU SHALL LABOR AND DO ALL YOUR WORK BUT THE SEVENTH DAY IS A SABBATH TO THE LORD YOUR GOD

ON IT YOU SHALL NOT DO ANY WORK YOU OR YOUR SON OR YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR MALE SERVANT OR YOUR FEMALE SERVANT OR YOUR OX OR YOUR DONKEY OR ANY OF YOUR LIVESTOCK OR THE SOJOURNER WHO IS WITHIN YOUR GATES THAT YOUR MALE SERVANT AND YOUR FEMALE SERVANT MAY REST AS WELL AS YOU

YOU SHALL REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE A SLAVE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LORD YOUR GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM THERE WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM

THEREFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD COMMANDED YOU TO KEEP THE SABBATH DAY

'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER AS THE LORD YOUR GOD COMMANDED YOU THAT YOUR DAYS MAY BE LONG AND THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU

'YOU SHALL NOT MURDER

'AND YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY

'AND YOU SHALL NOT STEAL

'AND YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR

'AND YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR'S WIFE

AND YOU SHALL NOT DESIRE YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE HIS FIELD OR HIS MALE SERVANT OR HIS FEMALE SERVANT HIS OX OR HIS DONKEY OR ANYTHING THAT IS YOUR NEIGHBOR'S

' THESE WORDS THE LORD SPOKE TO ALL YOUR ASSEMBLY AT THE MOUNTAIN OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE THE CLOUD AND THE THICK DARKNESS WITH A LOUD VOICE; AND HE ADDED NO MORE

AND HE WROTE THEM ON TWO TABLETS OF STONE AND GAVE THEM TO ME

AND AS SOON AS YOU HEARD THE VOICE OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE DARKNESS WHILE THE MOUNTAIN WAS BURNING WITH FIRE YOU CAME NEAR TO ME ALL THE HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES AND YOUR ELDERS

AND YOU SAID 'BEHOLD THE LORD OUR GOD HAS SHOWN US HIS GLORY AND GREATNESS AND WE HAVE HEARD HIS VOICE OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE

THIS DAY WE HAVE SEEN GOD SPEAK WITH MAN AND MAN STILL LIVE

NOW THEREFORE WHY SHOULD WE DIE

FOR THIS GREAT FIRE WILL CONSUME US

IF WE HEAR THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD ANY MORE WE SHALL DIE

FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH THAT HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD SPEAKING OUT OF THE MIDST OF FIRE AS WE HAVE AND HAS STILL LIVED

GO NEAR AND HEAR ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD WILL SAY AND SPEAK TO US ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD WILL SPEAK TO YOU AND WE WILL HEAR AND DO IT

' AND THE LORD HEARD YOUR WORDS WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF THIS PEOPLE WHICH THEY HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU

THEY ARE RIGHT IN ALL THAT THEY HAVE SPOKEN

OH THAT THEY HAD SUCH A MIND AS THIS ALWAYS TO FEAR ME AND TO KEEP ALL MY COMMANDMENTS THAT IT MIGHT GO WELL WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR DESCENDANTS FOREVER

GO AND SAY TO THEM RETURN TO YOUR TENTS

 BUT YOU STAND HERE BY ME AND I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE COMMANDMENT AND THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT YOU SHALL TEACH THEM THAT THEY MAY DO THEM IN THE LAND THAT I AM GIVING THEM TO POSSESS

' YOU SHALL BE CAREFUL THEREFORE TO DO AS THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS COMMANDED YOU

YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT

YOU SHALL WALK IN ALL THE WAY THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS COMMANDED YOU THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG IN THE LAND THAT YOU SHALL POSSESS

NOW THIS IS THE COMMANDMENT THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD COMMANDED ME TO TEACH YOU THAT YOU MAY DO THEM IN THE LAND TO WHICH YOU ARE GOING OVER TO POSSESS IT THAT YOU MAY FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU AND YOUR SON AND YOUR SON'S SON BY KEEPING ALL HIS STATUTES AND HIS COMMANDMENTS WHICH I COMMAND YOU ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT YOUR DAYS MAY BE LONG

HEAR THEREFORE O ISRAEL AND BE CAREFUL TO DO THEM THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY MULTIPLY GREATLY AS THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS HAS PROMISED YOU IN A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY

HEAR O ISRAEL THE LORD OUR GOD THE LORD IS ONE

YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT

AND THESE WORDS THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY SHALL BE ON YOUR HEART

YOU SHALL TEACH THEM DILIGENTLY TO YOUR CHILDREN AND SHALL TALK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK BY THE WAY AND WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE

YOU SHALL BIND THEM AS A SIGN ON YOUR HAND AND THEY SHALL BE AS FRONTLETS BETWEEN YOUR EYES

YOU SHALL WRITE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND ON YOUR GATES

AND WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB TO GIVE YOUWITH GREAT AND GOOD CITIES THAT YOU DID NOT BUILD AND HOUSES FULL OF ALL GOOD THINGS THAT YOU DID NOT FILL AND CISTERNS THAT YOU DID NOT DIG AND VINEYARDS AND OLIVE TREES THAT YOU DID NOT PLANTAND WHEN YOU EAT AND ARE FULL THEN TAKE CARE LEST YOU FORGET THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY

IT IS THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR

HIM YOU SHALL SERVE AND BY HIS NAME YOU SHALL SWEAR

YOU SHALL NOT GO AFTER OTHER GODS THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES WHO ARE AROUND YOU FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IN YOUR MIDST IS A JEALOUS GOD LEST THE ANGER OF THE LORD YOUR GOD BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU AND HE DESTROY YOU FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH

YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST AS YOU TESTED HIM AT MASSAH

YOU SHALL DILIGENTLY KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIS TESTIMONIES AND HIS STATUTES WHICH HE HAS COMMANDED YOU

AND YOU SHALL DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND GOOD IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY GO IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOOD LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS BY THRUSTING OUT ALL YOUR ENEMIES FROM BEFORE YOU AS THE LORD HAS PROMISED

WHEN YOUR SON ASKS YOU IN TIME TO COME 'WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE TESTIMONIES AND THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT THE LORD OUR GOD HAS COMMANDED YOU

' THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO YOUR SON 'WE WERE PHARAOH'S SLAVES IN EGYPT

AND THE LORD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT WITH A MIGHTY HAND

AND THE LORD SHOWED SIGNS AND WONDERS GREAT AND GRIEVOUS AGAINST EGYPT AND AGAINST PHARAOH AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD BEFORE OUR EYES

AND HE BROUGHT US OUT FROM THERE THAT HE MIGHT BRING US IN AND GIVE US THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO GIVE TO OUR FATHERS

AND THE LORD COMMANDED US TO DO ALL THESE STATUTES TO FEAR THE LORD OUR GOD FOR OUR GOOD ALWAYS THAT HE MIGHT PRESERVE US ALIVE AS WE ARE THIS DAY

AND IT WILL BE RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR US IF WE ARE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THIS COMMANDMENT BEFORE THE LORD OUR GOD AS HE HAS COMMANDED US

'WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT AND CLEARS AWAY MANY NATIONS BEFORE YOU THE HITTITES THE GIRGASHITES THE AMORITES THE CANAANITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES SEVEN NATIONS MORE NUMEROUS AND MIGHTIER THAN YOURSELVES AND WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD GIVES THEM OVER TO YOU AND YOU DEFEAT THEM THEN YOU MUST DEVOTE THEM TO COMPLETE DESTRUCTION

YOU SHALL MAKE NO COVENANT WITH THEM AND SHOW NO MERCY TO THEM

YOU SHALL NOT INTERMARRY WITH THEM GIVING YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THEIR SONS OR TAKING THEIR DAUGHTERS FOR YOUR SONS FOR THEY WOULD TURN AWAY YOUR SONS FROM FOLLOWING ME TO SERVE OTHER GODS

THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WOULD BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU AND HE WOULD DESTROY YOU QUICKLY

BUT THUS SHALL YOU DEAL WITH THEM YOU SHALL BREAK DOWN THEIR ALTARS AND DASH IN PIECES THEIR PILLARS AND CHOP DOWN THEIR ASHERIM AND BURN THEIR CARVED IMAGES WITH FIRE

FOR YOU ARE A PEOPLE HOLY TO THE LORD YOUR GOD

THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU TO BE A PEOPLE FOR HIS TREASURED POSSESSION OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLES WHO ARE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

IT WAS NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE MORE IN NUMBER THAN ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT THE LORD SET HIS LOVE ON YOU AND CHOSE YOU FOR YOU WERE THE FEWEST OF ALL PEOPLES BUT IT IS BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES YOU AND IS KEEPING THE OATH THAT HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS THAT THE LORD HAS BROUGHT YOU OUT WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND REDEEMED YOU FROM THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY FROM THE HAND OF PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT

KNOW THEREFORE THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GOD THE FAITHFUL GOD WHO KEEPS COVENANT AND STEADFAST LOVE WITH THOSE WHO LOVE HIM AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS TO A THOUSAND GENERATIONS AND REPAYS TO THEIR FACE THOSE WHO HATE HIM BY DESTROYING THEM

HE WILL NOT BE SLACK WITH ONE WHO HATES HIM

HE WILL REPAY HIM TO HIS FACE

YOU SHALL THEREFORE BE CAREFUL TO DO THE COMMANDMENT AND THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY

AND BECAUSE YOU LISTEN TO THESE RULES AND KEEP AND DO THEM THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL KEEP WITH YOU THE COVENANT AND THE STEADFAST LOVE THAT HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS

HE WILL LOVE YOU BLESS YOU AND MULTIPLY YOU

HE WILL ALSO BLESS THE FRUIT OF YOUR WOMB AND THE FRUIT OF YOUR GROUND YOUR GRAIN AND YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL THE INCREASE OF YOUR HERDS AND THE YOUNG OF YOUR FLOCK IN THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE YOU

YOU SHALL BE BLESSED ABOVE ALL PEOPLES

THERE SHALL NOT BE MALE OR FEMALE BARREN AMONG YOU OR AMONG YOUR LIVESTOCK

AND THE LORD WILL TAKE AWAY FROM YOU ALL SICKNESS AND NONE OF THE EVIL DISEASES OF EGYPT WHICH YOU KNEW WILL HE INFLICT ON YOU BUT HE WILL LAY THEM ON ALL WHO HATE YOU

AND YOU SHALL CONSUME ALL THE PEOPLES THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL GIVE OVER TO YOU

YOUR EYE SHALL NOT PITY THEM NEITHER SHALL YOU SERVE THEIR GODS FOR THAT WOULD BE A SNARE TO YOU

IF YOU SAY IN YOUR HEART 'THESE NATIONS ARE GREATER THAN I

HOW CAN I DISPOSSESS THEM

' YOU SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM BUT YOU SHALL REMEMBER WHAT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID TO PHARAOH AND TO ALL EGYPT THE GREAT TRIALS THAT YOUR EYES SAW THE SIGNS THE WONDERS THE MIGHTY HAND AND THE OUTSTRETCHED ARM BY WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT

SO WILL THE LORD YOUR GOD DO TO ALL THE PEOPLES OF WHOM YOU ARE AFRAID

MOREOVER THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL SEND HORNETS AMONG THEM UNTIL THOSE WHO ARE LEFT AND HIDE THEMSELVES FROM YOU ARE DESTROYED

YOU SHALL NOT BE IN DREAD OF THEM FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS IN YOUR MIDST A GREAT AND AWESOME GOD

THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL CLEAR AWAY THESE NATIONS BEFORE YOU LITTLE BY LITTLE

YOU MAY NOT MAKE AN END OF THEM AT ONCE LEST THE WILD BEASTS GROW TOO NUMEROUS FOR YOU

BUT THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL GIVE THEM OVER TO YOU AND THROW THEM INTO GREAT CONFUSION UNTIL THEY ARE DESTROYED

AND HE WILL GIVE THEIR KINGS INTO YOUR HAND AND YOU SHALL MAKE THEIR NAME PERISH FROM UNDER HEAVEN

NO ONE SHALL BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST YOU UNTIL YOU HAVE DESTROYED THEM

THE CARVED IMAGES OF THEIR GODS YOU SHALL BURN WITH FIRE

YOU SHALL NOT COVET THE SILVER OR THE GOLD THAT IS ON THEM OR TAKE IT FOR YOURSELVES LEST YOU BE ENSNARED BY IT FOR IT IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD YOUR GOD

AND YOU SHALL NOT BRING AN ABOMINABLE THING INTO YOUR HOUSE AND BECOME DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION LIKE IT

YOU SHALL UTTERLY DETEST AND ABHOR IT FOR IT IS DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION

THE WHOLE COMMANDMENT THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY YOU SHALL BE CAREFUL TO DO THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND MULTIPLY AND GO IN AND POSSESS THE LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS

AND YOU SHALL REMEMBER THE WHOLE WAY THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS LED YOU THESE FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS THAT HE MIGHT HUMBLE YOU TESTING YOU TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN YOUR HEART WHETHER YOU WOULD KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS OR NOT

AND HE HUMBLED YOU AND LET YOU HUNGER AND FED YOU WITH MANNA WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW NOR DID YOUR FATHERS KNOW THAT HE MIGHT MAKE YOU KNOW THAT MAN DOES NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE BUT MAN LIVES BY EVERY WORD THAT COMES FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LORD

YOUR CLOTHING DID NOT WEAR OUT ON YOU AND YOUR FOOT DID NOT SWELL THESE FORTY YEARS

KNOW THEN IN YOUR HEART THAT AS A MAN DISCIPLINES HIS SON THE LORD YOUR GOD DISCIPLINES YOU

SO YOU SHALL KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD BY WALKING IN HIS WAYS AND BY FEARING HIM

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU INTO A GOOD LAND A LAND OF BROOKS OF WATER OF FOUNTAINS AND SPRINGS FLOWING OUT IN THE VALLEYS AND HILLS A LAND OF WHEAT AND BARLEY OF VINES AND FIG TREES AND POMEGRANATES A LAND OF OLIVE TREES AND HONEY A LAND IN WHICH YOU WILL EAT BREAD WITHOUT SCARCITY IN WHICH YOU WILL LACK NOTHING A LAND WHOSE STONES ARE IRON AND OUT OF WHOSE HILLS YOU CAN DIG COPPER

AND YOU SHALL EAT AND BE FULL AND YOU SHALL BLESS THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR THE GOOD LAND HE HAS GIVEN YOU

TAKE CARE LEST YOU FORGET THE LORD YOUR GOD BY NOT KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS AND HIS RULES AND HIS STATUTES WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY LEST WHEN YOU HAVE EATEN AND ARE FULL AND HAVE BUILT GOOD HOUSES AND LIVE IN THEM AND WHEN YOUR HERDS AND FLOCKS MULTIPLY AND YOUR SILVER AND GOLD IS MULTIPLIED AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE IS MULTIPLIED THEN YOUR HEART BE LIFTED UP AND YOU FORGET THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY WHO LED YOU THROUGH THE GREAT AND TERRIFYING WILDERNESS WITH ITS FIERY SERPENTS AND SCORPIONS AND THIRSTY GROUND WHERE THERE WAS NO WATER WHO BROUGHT YOU WATER OUT OF THE FLINTY ROCK WHO FED YOU IN THE WILDERNESS WITH MANNA THAT YOUR FATHERS DID NOT KNOW THAT HE MIGHT HUMBLE YOU AND TEST YOU TO DO YOU GOOD IN THE END

BEWARE LEST YOU SAY IN YOUR HEART 'MY POWER AND THE MIGHT OF MY HAND HAVE GOTTEN ME THIS WEALTH

' YOU SHALL REMEMBER THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR IT IS HE WHO GIVES YOU POWER TO GET WEALTH THAT HE MAY CONFIRM HIS COVENANT THAT HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS AS IT IS THIS DAY

AND IF YOU FORGET THE LORD YOUR GOD AND GO AFTER OTHER GODS AND SERVE THEM AND WORSHIP THEM I SOLEMNLY WARN YOU TODAY THAT YOU SHALL SURELY PERISH

LIKE THE NATIONS THAT THE LORD MAKES TO PERISH BEFORE YOU SO SHALL YOU PERISH BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

HEAR O ISRAEL YOU ARE TO CROSS OVER THE JORDAN TODAY TO GO IN TO DISPOSSESS NATIONS GREATER AND MIGHTIER THAN YOURSELVES CITIES GREAT AND FORTIFIED UP TO HEAVEN A PEOPLE GREAT AND TALL THE SONS OF THE ANAKIM WHOM YOU KNOW AND OF WHOM YOU HAVE HEARD IT SAID 'WHO CAN STAND BEFORE THE SONS OF ANAK

' KNOW THEREFORE TODAY THAT HE WHO GOES OVER BEFORE YOU AS A CONSUMING FIRE IS THE LORD YOUR GOD

HE WILL DESTROY THEM AND SUBDUE THEM BEFORE YOU

SO YOU SHALL DRIVE THEM OUT AND MAKE THEM PERISH QUICKLY AS THE LORD HAS PROMISED YOU

DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART AFTER THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS THRUST THEM OUT BEFORE YOU 'IT IS BECAUSE OF MY RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT THE LORD HAS BROUGHT ME IN TO POSSESS THIS LAND' WHEREAS IT IS BECAUSE OF THE WICKEDNESS OF THESE NATIONS THAT THE LORD IS DRIVING THEM OUT BEFORE YOU

NOT BECAUSE OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS OR THE UPRIGHTNESS OF YOUR HEART ARE YOU GOING IN TO POSSESS THEIR LAND BUT BECAUSE OF THE WICKEDNESS OF THESE NATIONS THE LORD YOUR GOD IS DRIVING THEM OUT FROM BEFORE YOU AND THAT HE MAY CONFIRM THE WORD THAT THE LORD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB

KNOW THEREFORE THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS NOT GIVING YOU THIS GOOD LAND TO POSSESS BECAUSE OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR YOU ARE A STUBBORN PEOPLE

REMEMBER AND DO NOT FORGET HOW YOU PROVOKED THE LORD YOUR GOD TO WRATH IN THE WILDERNESS

FROM THE DAY YOU CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT UNTIL YOU CAME TO THIS PLACE YOU HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS AGAINST THE LORD

EVEN AT HOREB YOU PROVOKED THE LORD TO WRATH AND THE LORD WAS SO ANGRY WITH YOU THAT HE WAS READY TO DESTROY YOU

WHEN I WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN TO RECEIVE THE TABLETS OF STONE THE TABLETS OF THE COVENANT THAT THE LORD MADE WITH YOU I REMAINED ON THE MOUNTAIN FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS

I NEITHER ATE BREAD NOR DRANK WATER

AND THE LORD GAVE ME THE TWO TABLETS OF STONE WRITTEN WITH THE FINGER OF GOD AND ON THEM WERE ALL THE WORDS THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN WITH YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE ON THE DAY OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND AT THE END OF FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS THE LORD GAVE ME THE TWO TABLETS OF STONE THE TABLETS OF THE COVENANT

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME 'ARISE GO DOWN QUICKLY FROM HERE FOR YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT FROM EGYPT HAVE ACTED CORRUPTLY

THEY HAVE TURNED ASIDE QUICKLY OUT OF THE WAY THAT I COMMANDED THEM; THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES A METAL IMAGE

' FURTHERMORE THE LORD SAID TO ME 'I HAVE SEEN THIS PEOPLE AND BEHOLD IT IS A STUBBORN PEOPLE

LET ME ALONE THAT I MAY DESTROY THEM AND BLOT OUT THEIR NAME FROM UNDER HEAVEN

AND I WILL MAKE OF YOU A NATION MIGHTIER AND GREATER THAN THEY

' SO I TURNED AND CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MOUNTAIN WAS BURNING WITH FIRE

AND THE TWO TABLETS OF THE COVENANT WERE IN MY TWO HANDS

AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD YOU HAD SINNED AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD

YOU HAD MADE YOURSELVES A GOLDEN CALF

YOU HAD TURNED ASIDE QUICKLY FROM THE WAY THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED YOU

SO I TOOK HOLD OF THE TWO TABLETS AND THREW THEM OUT OF MY TWO HANDS AND BROKE THEM BEFORE YOUR EYES

THEN I LAY PROSTRATE BEFORE THE LORD AS BEFORE FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS

I NEITHER ATE BREAD NOR DRANK WATER BECAUSE OF ALL THE SIN THAT YOU HAD COMMITTED IN DOING WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD TO PROVOKE HIM TO ANGER

FOR I WAS AFRAID OF THE ANGER AND HOT DISPLEASURE THAT THE LORD BORE AGAINST YOU SO THAT HE WAS READY TO DESTROY YOU

BUT THE LORD LISTENED TO ME THAT TIME ALSO

AND THE LORD WAS SO ANGRY WITH AARON THAT HE WAS READY TO DESTROY HIM

AND I PRAYED FOR AARON ALSO AT THE SAME TIME

THEN I TOOK THE SINFUL THING THE CALF THAT YOU HAD MADE AND BURNED IT WITH FIRE AND CRUSHED IT GRINDING IT VERY SMALL UNTIL IT WAS AS FINE AS DUST

AND I THREW THE DUST OF IT INTO THE BROOK THAT RAN DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN

AT TABERAH ALSO AND AT MASSAH AND AT KIBROTHHATTAAVAH YOU PROVOKED THE LORD TO WRATH

AND WHEN THE LORD SENT YOU FROM KADESHBARNEA SAYING 'GO UP AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU' THEN YOU REBELLED AGAINST THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND DID NOT BELIEVE HIM OR OBEY HIS VOICE

YOU HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS AGAINST THE LORD FROM THE DAY THAT I KNEW YOU

SO I LAY PROSTRATE BEFORE THE LORD FOR THESE FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS BECAUSE THE LORD HAD SAID HE WOULD DESTROY YOU

AND I PRAYED TO THE LORD 'O LORD GOD DESTROY NOT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE WHOM YOU HAVE REDEEMED THROUGH YOUR GREATNESS WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT OUT OF EGYPT WITH A MIGHTY HAND

REMEMBER YOUR SERVANTS ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB

DO NOT REGARD THE STUBBORNNESS OF THIS PEOPLE OR THEIR WICKEDNESS OR THEIR SIN LEST THE LAND FROM WHICH YOU BROUGHT US SAY BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THEM INTO THE LAND THAT HE PROMISED THEM AND BECAUSE HE HATED THEM HE HAS BROUGHT THEM OUT TO PUT THEM TO DEATH IN THE WILDERNESS

 FOR THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE WHOM YOU BROUGHT OUT BY YOUR GREAT POWER AND BY YOUR OUTSTRETCHED ARM

'AT THAT TIME THE LORD SAID TO ME 'CUT FOR YOURSELF TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST AND COME UP TO ME ON THE MOUNTAIN AND MAKE AN ARK OF WOOD

AND I WILL WRITE ON THE TABLETS THE WORDS THAT WERE ON THE FIRST TABLETS THAT YOU BROKE AND YOU SHALL PUT THEM IN THE ARK

' SO I MADE AN ARK OF ACACIA WOOD AND CUT TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST AND WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE TWO TABLETS IN MY HAND

AND HE WROTE ON THE TABLETS IN THE SAME WRITING AS BEFORE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN TO YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE ON THE DAY OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND THE LORD GAVE THEM TO ME

THEN I TURNED AND CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND PUT THE TABLETS IN THE ARK THAT I HAD MADE

AND THERE THEY ARE AS THE LORD COMMANDED ME

 THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED FROM BEEROTH BENEJAAKAN TO MOSERAH

THERE AARON DIED AND THERE HE WAS BURIED

AND HIS SON ELEAZAR MINISTERED AS PRIEST IN HIS PLACE

FROM THERE THEY JOURNEYED TO GUDGODAH AND FROM GUDGODAH TO JOTBATHAH A LAND WITH BROOKS OF WATER

AT THAT TIME THE LORD SET APART THE TRIBE OF LEVI TO CARRY THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TO STAND BEFORE THE LORD TO MINISTER TO HIM AND TO BLESS IN HIS NAME TO THIS DAY

THEREFORE LEVI HAS NO PORTION OR INHERITANCE WITH HIS BROTHERS

THE LORD IS HIS INHERITANCE AS THE LORD YOUR GOD SAID TO HIM

 I MYSELF STAYED ON THE MOUNTAIN AS AT THE FIRST TIME FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS AND THE LORD LISTENED TO ME THAT TIME ALSO

THE LORD WAS UNWILLING TO DESTROY YOU

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'ARISE GO ON YOUR JOURNEY AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY MAY GO IN AND POSSESS THE LAND WHICH I SWORE TO THEIR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM

' AND NOW ISRAEL WHAT DOES THE LORD YOUR GOD REQUIRE OF YOU BUT TO FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD TO WALK IN ALL HIS WAYS TO LOVE HIM TO SERVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND TO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS AND STATUTES OF THE LORD WHICH I AM COMMANDING YOU TODAY FOR YOUR GOOD

BEHOLD TO THE LORD YOUR GOD BELONG HEAVEN AND THE HEAVEN OF HEAVENS THE EARTH WITH ALL THAT IS IN IT

YET THE LORD SET HIS HEART IN LOVE ON YOUR FATHERS AND CHOSE THEIR OFFSPRING AFTER THEM YOU ABOVE ALL PEOPLES AS YOU ARE THIS DAY

CIRCUMCISE THEREFORE THE FORESKIN OF YOUR HEART AND BE NO LONGER STUBBORN

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GOD OF GODS AND LORD OF LORDS THE GREAT THE MIGHTY AND THE AWESOME GOD WHO IS NOT PARTIAL AND TAKES NO BRIBE

HE EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW AND LOVES THE SOJOURNER GIVING HIM FOOD AND CLOTHING

LOVE THE SOJOURNER THEREFORE FOR YOU WERE SOJOURNERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

YOU SHALL FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD

YOU SHALL SERVE HIM AND HOLD FAST TO HIM AND BY HIS NAME YOU SHALL SWEAR

HE IS YOUR PRAISE

HE IS YOUR GOD WHO HAS DONE FOR YOU THESE GREAT AND TERRIFYING THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN

YOUR FATHERS WENT DOWN TO EGYPT SEVENTY PERSONS AND NOW THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS MADE YOU AS NUMEROUS AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN

YOU SHALL THEREFORE LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND KEEP HIS CHARGE HIS STATUTES HIS RULES AND HIS COMMANDMENTS ALWAYS

AND CONSIDER TODAY SINCE I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN OR SEEN IT CONSIDER THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD HIS GREATNESS HIS MIGHTY HAND AND HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM HIS SIGNS AND HIS DEEDS THAT HE DID IN EGYPT TO PHARAOH THE KING OF EGYPT AND TO ALL HIS LAND AND WHAT HE DID TO THE ARMY OF EGYPT TO THEIR HORSES AND TO THEIR CHARIOTS HOW HE MADE THE WATER OF THE RED SEA FLOW OVER THEM AS THEY PURSUED AFTER YOU AND HOW THE LORD HAS DESTROYED THEM TO THIS DAY AND WHAT HE DID TO YOU IN THE WILDERNESS UNTIL YOU CAME TO THIS PLACE AND WHAT HE DID TO DATHAN AND ABIRAM THE SONS OF ELIAB SON OF REUBEN HOW THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM UP WITH THEIR HOUSEHOLDS THEIR TENTS AND EVERY LIVING THING THAT FOLLOWED THEM IN THE MIDST OF ALL ISRAEL

FOR YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN ALL THE GREAT WORK OF THE LORD THAT HE DID

YOU SHALL THEREFORE KEEP THE WHOLE COMMANDMENT THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY THAT YOU MAY BE STRONG AND GO IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER TO POSSESS AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE TO THEM AND TO THEIR OFFSPRING A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY

FOR THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT IS NOT LIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT FROM WHICH YOU HAVE COME WHERE YOU SOWED YOUR SEED AND IRRIGATED IT LIKE A GARDEN OF VEGETABLES

BUT THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER TO POSSESS IS A LAND OF HILLS AND VALLEYS WHICH DRINKS WATER BY THE RAIN FROM HEAVEN A LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD CARES FOR

THE EYES OF THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALWAYS UPON IT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO THE END OF THE YEAR

AND IF YOU WILL INDEED OBEY MY COMMANDMENTS THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY TO LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL HE WILL GIVE THE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND IN ITS SEASON THE EARLY RAIN AND THE LATER RAIN THAT YOU MAY GATHER IN YOUR GRAIN AND YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL

AND HE WILL GIVE GRASS IN YOUR FIELDS FOR YOUR LIVESTOCK AND YOU SHALL EAT AND BE FULL

TAKE CARE LEST YOUR HEART BE DECEIVED AND YOU TURN ASIDE AND SERVE OTHER GODS AND WORSHIP THEM; THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU AND HE WILL SHUT UP THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO RAIN AND THE LAND WILL YIELD NO FRUIT AND YOU WILL PERISH QUICKLY OFF THE GOOD LAND THAT THE LORD IS GIVING YOU

YOU SHALL THEREFORE LAY UP THESE WORDS OF MINE IN YOUR HEART AND IN YOUR SOUL AND YOU SHALL BIND THEM AS A SIGN ON YOUR HAND AND THEY SHALL BE AS FRONTLETS BETWEEN YOUR EYES

YOU SHALL TEACH THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN TALKING OF THEM WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU ARE WALKING BY THE WAY AND WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE

YOU SHALL WRITE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND ON YOUR GATES THAT YOUR DAYS AND THE DAYS OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE MULTIPLIED IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM AS LONG AS THE HEAVENS ARE ABOVE THE EARTH

FOR IF YOU WILL BE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THIS COMMANDMENT THAT I COMMAND YOU TO DO LOVING THE LORD YOUR GOD WALKING IN ALL HIS WAYS AND HOLDING FAST TO HIM THEN THE LORD WILL DRIVE OUT ALL THESE NATIONS BEFORE YOU AND YOU WILL DISPOSSESS NATIONS GREATER AND MIGHTIER THAN YOURSELVES

EVERY PLACE ON WHICH THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT TREADS SHALL BE YOURS

YOUR TERRITORY SHALL BE FROM THE WILDERNESS TO THE LEBANON AND FROM THE RIVER THE RIVER EUPHRATES TO THE WESTERN SEA

NO ONE SHALL BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST YOU

THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL LAY THE FEAR OF YOU AND THE DREAD OF YOU ON ALL THE LAND THAT YOU SHALL TREAD AS HE PROMISED YOU

SEE I AM SETTING BEFORE YOU TODAY A BLESSING AND A CURSE THE BLESSING IF YOU OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY AND THE CURSE IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD BUT TURN ASIDE FROM THE WAY THAT I AM COMMANDING YOU TODAY TO GO AFTER OTHER GODS THAT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN

AND WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT YOU SHALL SET THE BLESSING ON MOUNT GERIZIM AND THE CURSE ON MOUNT EBAL

ARE THEY NOT BEYOND THE JORDAN WEST OF THE ROAD TOWARD THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN IN THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES WHO LIVE IN THE ARABAH OPPOSITE GILGAL BESIDE THE OAK OF MOREH

FOR YOU ARE TO CROSS OVER THE JORDAN TO GO IN TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU

AND WHEN YOU POSSESS IT AND LIVE IN IT YOU SHALL BE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT I AM SETTING BEFORE YOU TODAY

THESE ARE THE STATUTES AND RULES THAT YOU SHALL BE CAREFUL TO DO IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS HAS GIVEN YOU TO POSSESS ALL THE DAYS THAT YOU LIVE ON THE EARTH

YOU SHALL SURELY DESTROY ALL THE PLACES WHERE THE NATIONS WHOM YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS SERVED THEIR GODS ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS AND ON THE HILLS AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE

YOU SHALL TEAR DOWN THEIR ALTARS AND DASH IN PIECES THEIR PILLARS AND BURN THEIR ASHERIM WITH FIRE

YOU SHALL CHOP DOWN THE CARVED IMAGES OF THEIR GODS AND DESTROY THEIR NAME OUT OF THAT PLACE

YOU SHALL NOT WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD IN THAT WAY

BUT YOU SHALL SEEK THE PLACE THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL CHOOSE OUT OF ALL YOUR TRIBES TO PUT HIS NAME AND MAKE HIS HABITATION THERE

THERE YOU SHALL GO AND THERE YOU SHALL BRING YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND YOUR SACRIFICES YOUR TITHES AND THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOU PRESENT YOUR VOW OFFERINGS YOUR FREEWILL OFFERINGS AND THE FIRSTBORN OF YOUR HERD AND OF YOUR FLOCK

AND THERE YOU SHALL EAT BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND YOU SHALL REJOICE YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLDS IN ALL THAT YOU UNDERTAKE IN WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS BLESSED YOU

AND YOU SHALL REJOICE BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS YOUR MALE SERVANTS AND YOUR FEMALE SERVANTS AND THE LEVITE THAT IS WITHIN YOUR TOWNS SINCE HE HAS NO PORTION OR INHERITANCE WITH YOU

TAKE CARE THAT YOU DO NOT OFFER YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AT ANY PLACE THAT YOU SEE BUT AT THE PLACE THAT THE LORD WILL CHOOSE IN ONE OF YOUR TRIBES THERE YOU SHALL OFFER YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND THERE YOU SHALL DO ALL THAT I AM COMMANDING YOU

HOWEVER YOU MAY SLAUGHTER AND EAT MEAT WITHIN ANY OF YOUR TOWNS AS MUCH AS YOU DESIRE ACCORDING TO THE BLESSING OF THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT HE HAS GIVEN YOU

ONLY YOU SHALL NOT EAT THE BLOOD; YOU SHALL POUR IT OUT ON THE EARTH LIKE WATER

AND ALL ISRAEL SHALL HEAR AND FEAR AND NEVER AGAIN DO ANY SUCH WICKEDNESS AS THIS AMONG YOU

IF YOU HEAR IN ONE OF YOUR CITIES WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU TO DWELL THERE THAT CERTAIN WORTHLESS FELLOWS HAVE GONE OUT AMONG YOU AND HAVE DRAWN AWAY THE INHABITANTS OF THEIR CITY SAYING 'LET US GO AND SERVE OTHER GODS' WHICH YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN THEN YOU SHALL INQUIRE AND MAKE SEARCH AND ASK DILIGENTLY

BUT THE PROPHET WHO PRESUMES TO SPEAK A WORD IN MY NAME THAT I HAVE NOT COMMANDED HIM TO SPEAK OR WHO SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF OTHER GODS THAT SAME PROPHET SHALL DIE

' AND IF YOU SAY IN YOUR HEART 'HOW MAY WE KNOW THE WORD THAT THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN

' WHEN A PROPHET SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF THE LORD IF THE WORD DOES NOT COME TO PASS OR COME TRUE THAT IS A WORD THAT THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN; THE PROPHET HAS SPOKEN IT PRESUMPTUOUSLY

YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM

WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD CUTS OFF THE NATIONS WHOSE LAND THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU AND YOU DISPOSSESS THEM AND DWELL IN THEIR CITIES AND IN THEIR HOUSES YOU SHALL SET APART THREE CITIES FOR YOURSELVES IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU TO POSSESS

YOU SHALL MEASURE THE DISTANCES AND DIVIDE INTO THREE PARTS THE AREA OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD GIVES YOU AS A POSSESSION SO THAT ANY MANSLAYER CAN FLEE TO THEM

THEREFORE I COMMAND YOU YOU SHALL SET APART THREE CITIES

AND IF THE LORD YOUR GOD ENLARGES YOUR TERRITORY AS HE HAS SWORN TO YOUR FATHERS AND GIVES YOU ALL THE LAND THAT HE PROMISED TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS PROVIDED YOU ARE CAREFUL TO KEEP ALL THIS COMMANDMENT WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY BY LOVING THE LORD YOUR GOD AND BY WALKING EVER IN HIS WAYSTHEN YOU SHALL ADD THREE OTHER CITIES TO THESE THREE LEST INNOCENT BLOOD BE SHED IN YOUR LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU FOR AN INHERITANCE AND SO THE GUILT OF BLOODSHED BE UPON YOU

 AND YET THIS IS THE EVIDENCE OF MY DAUGHTER'S VIRGINITY

' AND THEY SHALL SPREAD THE CLOAK BEFORE THE ELDERS OF THE CITY

THEN THE ELDERS OF THAT CITY SHALL TAKE THE MAN AND WHIP HIM AND THEY SHALL FINE HIM A HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER AND GIVE THEM TO THE FATHER OF THE YOUNG WOMAN BECAUSE HE HAS BROUGHT A BAD NAME UPON A VIRGIN OF ISRAEL

AND SHE SHALL BE HIS WIFE

HE MAY NOT DIVORCE HER ALL HIS DAYS

AND THE LORD WILL BRING YOU BACK IN SHIPS TO EGYPT A JOURNEY THAT I PROMISED THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER MAKE AGAIN; AND THERE YOU SHALL OFFER YOURSELVES FOR SALE TO YOUR ENEMIES AS MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES BUT THERE WILL BE NO BUYER

THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE COVENANT THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES TO MAKE WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN THE LAND OF MOAB BESIDES THE COVENANT THAT HE HAD MADE WITH THEM AT HOREB

AND MOSES SUMMONED ALL ISRAEL AND SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THAT THE LORD DID BEFORE YOUR EYES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT TO PHARAOH AND TO ALL HIS SERVANTS AND TO ALL HIS LAND THE GREAT TRIALS THAT YOUR EYES SAW THE SIGNS AND THOSE GREAT WONDERS

BUT TO THIS DAY THE LORD HAS NOT GIVEN YOU A HEART TO UNDERSTAND OR EYES TO SEE OR EARS TO HEAR

I HAVE LED YOU FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS

YOUR CLOTHES HAVE NOT WORN OUT ON YOU AND YOUR SANDALS HAVE NOT WORN OFF YOUR FEET

YOU HAVE NOT EATEN BREAD AND YOU HAVE NOT DRUNK WINE OR STRONG DRINK THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

AND WHEN YOU CAME TO THIS PLACE SIHON THE KING OF HESHBON AND OG THE KING OF BASHAN CAME OUT AGAINST US TO BATTLE BUT WE DEFEATED THEM

WE TOOK THEIR LAND AND GAVE IT FOR AN INHERITANCE TO THE REUBENITES THE GADITES AND THE HALFTRIBE OF THE MANASSITES

THEREFORE KEEP THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT AND DO THEM THAT YOU MAY PROSPER IN ALL THAT YOU DO

YOU ARE STANDING TODAY ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD THE HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES YOUR ELDERS AND YOUR OFFICERS ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL YOUR LITTLE ONES YOUR WIVES AND THE SOJOURNER WHO IS IN YOUR CAMP FROM THE ONE WHO CHOPS YOUR WOOD TO THE ONE WHO DRAWS YOUR WATER SO THAT YOU MAY ENTER INTO THE SWORN COVENANT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD IS MAKING WITH YOU TODAY THAT HE MAY ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE AND THAT HE MAY BE YOUR GOD AS HE PROMISED YOU AND AS HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB

IT IS NOT WITH YOU ALONE THAT I AM MAKING THIS SWORN COVENANT BUT WITH WHOEVER IS STANDING HERE WITH US TODAY BEFORE THE LORD OUR GOD AND WITH WHOEVER IS NOT HERE WITH US TODAY

YOU KNOW HOW WE LIVED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND HOW WE CAME THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE NATIONS THROUGH WHICH YOU PASSED

AND YOU HAVE SEEN THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS THEIR IDOLS OF WOOD AND STONE OF SILVER AND GOLD WHICH WERE AMONG THEM

BEWARE LEST THERE BE AMONG YOU A MAN OR WOMAN OR CLAN OR TRIBE WHOSE HEART IS TURNING AWAY TODAY FROM THE LORD OUR GOD TO GO AND SERVE THE GODS OF THOSE NATIONS

BEWARE LEST THERE BE AMONG YOU A ROOT BEARING POISONOUS AND BITTER FRUIT ONE WHO WHEN HE HEARS THE WORDS OF THIS SWORN COVENANT BLESSES HIMSELF IN HIS HEART SAYING 'I SHALL BE SAFE THOUGH I WALK IN THE STUBBORNNESS OF MY HEART

' THIS WILL LEAD TO THE SWEEPING AWAY OF MOIST AND DRY ALIKE

THE LORD WILL NOT BE WILLING TO FORGIVE HIM BUT RATHER THE ANGER OF THE LORD AND HIS JEALOUSY WILL SMOKE AGAINST THAT MAN AND THE CURSES WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK WILL SETTLE UPON HIM AND THE LORD WILL BLOT OUT HIS NAME FROM UNDER HEAVEN

AND THE LORD WILL SINGLE HIM OUT FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL FOR CALAMITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THE CURSES OF THE COVENANT WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK OF THE LAW

AND THE NEXT GENERATION YOUR CHILDREN WHO RISE UP AFTER YOU AND THE FOREIGNER WHO COMES FROM A FAR LAND WILL SAY WHEN THEY SEE THE AFFLICTIONS OF THAT LAND AND THE SICKNESSES WITH WHICH THE LORD HAS MADE IT SICK THE WHOLE LAND BURNED OUT WITH BRIMSTONE AND SALT NOTHING SOWN AND NOTHING GROWING WHERE NO PLANT CAN SPROUT AN OVERTHROW LIKE THAT OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH ADMAH AND ZEBOIIM WHICH THE LORD OVERTHREW IN HIS ANGER AND WRATH ALL THE NATIONS WILL SAY 'WHY HAS THE LORD DONE THUS TO THIS LAND

WHAT CAUSED THE HEAT OF THIS GREAT ANGER

' THEN PEOPLE WILL SAY 'IT IS BECAUSE THEY ABANDONED THE COVENANT OF THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS WHICH HE MADE WITH THEM WHEN HE BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND WENT AND SERVED OTHER GODS AND WORSHIPED THEM GODS WHOM THEY HAD NOT KNOWN AND WHOM HE HAD NOT ALLOTTED TO THEM

THEREFORE THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST THIS LAND BRINGING UPON IT ALL THE CURSES WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK AND THE LORD UPROOTED THEM FROM THEIR LAND IN ANGER AND FURY AND GREAT WRATH AND CAST THEM INTO ANOTHER LAND AS THEY ARE THIS DAY

' THE SECRET THINGS BELONG TO THE LORD OUR GOD BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE REVEALED BELONG TO US AND TO OUR CHILDREN FOREVER THAT WE MAY DO ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW

AND WHEN ALL THESE THINGS COME UPON YOU THE BLESSING AND THE CURSE WHICH I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU AND YOU CALL THEM TO MIND AMONG ALL THE NATIONS WHERE THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS DRIVEN YOU AND RETURN TO THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND OBEY HIS VOICE IN ALL THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL THEN THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL RESTORE YOUR FORTUNES AND HAVE COMPASSION ON YOU AND HE WILL GATHER YOU AGAIN FROM ALL THE PEOPLES WHERE THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS SCATTERED YOU

IF YOUR OUTCASTS ARE IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF HEAVEN FROM THERE THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL GATHER YOU AND FROM THERE HE WILL TAKE YOU

AND THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL BRING YOU INTO THE LAND THAT YOUR FATHERS POSSESSED THAT YOU MAY POSSESS IT

AND HE WILL MAKE YOU MORE PROSPEROUS AND NUMEROUS THAN YOUR FATHERS

AND THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL CIRCUMCISE YOUR HEART AND THE HEART OF YOUR OFFSPRING SO THAT YOU WILL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL THAT YOU MAY LIVE

AND THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL PUT ALL THESE CURSES ON YOUR FOES AND ENEMIES WHO PERSECUTED YOU

AND YOU SHALL AGAIN OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD AND KEEP ALL HIS COMMANDMENTS THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY

THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL MAKE YOU ABUNDANTLY PROSPEROUS IN ALL THE WORK OF YOUR HAND IN THE FRUIT OF YOUR WOMB AND IN THE FRUIT OF YOUR CATTLE AND IN THE FRUIT OF YOUR GROUND

FOR THE LORD WILL AGAIN TAKE DELIGHT IN PROSPERING YOU AS HE TOOK DELIGHT IN YOUR FATHERS WHEN YOU OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND HIS STATUTES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK OF THE LAW WHEN YOU TURN TO THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL

FOR THIS COMMANDMENT THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY IS NOT TOO HARD FOR YOU NEITHER IS IT FAR OFF

IT IS NOT IN HEAVEN THAT YOU SHOULD SAY 'WHO WILL ASCEND TO HEAVEN FOR US AND BRING IT TO US THAT WE MAY HEAR IT AND DO IT

' NEITHER IS IT BEYOND THE SEA THAT YOU SHOULD SAY 'WHO WILL GO OVER THE SEA FOR US AND BRING IT TO US THAT WE MAY HEAR IT AND DO IT

' BUT THE WORD IS VERY NEAR YOU

IT IS IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU CAN DO IT

SEE I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU TODAY LIFE AND GOOD DEATH AND EVIL

IF YOU OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY BY LOVING THE LORD YOUR GOD BY WALKING IN HIS WAYS AND BY KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS AND HIS STATUTES AND HIS RULES THEN YOU SHALL LIVE AND MULTIPLY AND THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL BLESS YOU IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT

BUT IF YOUR HEART TURNS AWAY AND YOU WILL NOT HEAR BUT ARE DRAWN AWAY TO WORSHIP OTHER GODS AND SERVE THEM I DECLARE TO YOU TODAY THAT YOU SHALL SURELY PERISH

YOU SHALL NOT LIVE LONG IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER THE JORDAN TO ENTER AND POSSESS

I CALL HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU LIFE AND DEATH BLESSING AND CURSE

THEREFORE CHOOSE LIFE THAT YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING MAY LIVE LOVING THE LORD YOUR GOD OBEYING HIS VOICE AND HOLDING FAST TO HIM FOR HE IS YOUR LIFE AND LENGTH OF DAYS THAT YOU MAY DWELL IN THE LAND THAT THE LORD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB TO GIVE THEM

SO MOSES CONTINUED TO SPEAK THESE WORDS TO ALL ISRAEL

AND HE SAID TO THEM I AM  YEARS OLD TODAY

I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO GO OUT AND COME IN

THE LORD HAS SAID TO ME 'YOU SHALL NOT GO OVER THIS JORDAN

' THE LORD YOUR GOD HIMSELF WILL GO OVER BEFORE YOU

HE WILL DESTROY THESE NATIONS BEFORE YOU SO THAT YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS THEM AND JOSHUA WILL GO OVER AT YOUR HEAD AS THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

AND THE LORD WILL DO TO THEM AS HE DID TO SIHON AND OG THE KINGS OF THE AMORITES AND TO THEIR LAND WHEN HE DESTROYED THEM

AND THE LORD WILL GIVE THEM OVER TO YOU AND YOU SHALL DO TO THEM ACCORDING TO THE WHOLE COMMANDMENT THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

DO NOT FEAR OR BE IN DREAD OF THEM FOR IT IS THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO GOES WITH YOU

HE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU OR FORSAKE YOU

 THEN MOSES SUMMONED JOSHUA AND SAID TO HIM IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS FOR YOU SHALL GO WITH THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND THAT THE LORD HAS SWORN TO THEIR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM AND YOU SHALL PUT THEM IN POSSESSION OF IT

IT IS THE LORD WHO GOES BEFORE YOU

HE WILL BE WITH YOU; HE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU OR FORSAKE YOU

DO NOT FEAR OR BE DISMAYED

 THEN MOSES WROTE THIS LAW AND GAVE IT TO THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF LEVI WHO CARRIED THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD AND TO ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL

AND MOSES COMMANDED THEM AT THE END OF EVERY SEVEN YEARS AT THE SET TIME IN THE YEAR OF RELEASE AT THE FEAST OF BOOTHS WHEN ALL ISRAEL COMES TO APPEAR BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT THE PLACE THAT HE WILL CHOOSE YOU SHALL READ THIS LAW BEFORE ALL ISRAEL IN THEIR HEARING

ASSEMBLE THE PEOPLE MEN WOMEN AND LITTLE ONES AND THE SOJOURNER WITHIN YOUR TOWNS THAT THEY MAY HEAR AND LEARN TO FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD AND BE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN IT MAY HEAR AND LEARN TO FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD AS LONG AS YOU LIVE IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER THE JORDAN TO POSSESS

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD THE DAYS APPROACH WHEN YOU MUST DIE

CALL JOSHUA AND PRESENT YOURSELVES IN THE TENT OF MEETING THAT I MAY COMMISSION HIM

 AND MOSES AND JOSHUA WENT AND PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN THE TENT OF MEETING

AND THE LORD APPEARED IN THE TENT IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD

AND THE PILLAR OF CLOUD STOOD OVER THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD YOU ARE ABOUT TO LIE DOWN WITH YOUR FATHERS

THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL RISE AND WHORE AFTER THE FOREIGN GODS AMONG THEM IN THE LAND THAT THEY ARE ENTERING AND THEY WILL FORSAKE ME AND BREAK MY COVENANT THAT I HAVE MADE WITH THEM

THEN MY ANGER WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST THEM IN THAT DAY AND I WILL FORSAKE THEM AND HIDE MY FACE FROM THEM AND THEY WILL BE DEVOURED

AND MANY EVILS AND TROUBLES WILL COME UPON THEM SO THAT THEY WILL SAY IN THAT DAY 'HAVE NOT THESE EVILS COME UPON US BECAUSE OUR GOD IS NOT AMONG US

' AND I WILL SURELY HIDE MY FACE IN THAT DAY BECAUSE OF ALL THE EVIL THAT THEY HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TURNED TO OTHER GODS

NOW THEREFORE WRITE THIS SONG AND TEACH IT TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

PUT IT IN THEIR MOUTHS THAT THIS SONG MAY BE A WITNESS FOR ME AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

FOR WHEN I HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY WHICH I SWORE TO GIVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND THEY HAVE EATEN AND ARE FULL AND GROWN FAT THEY WILL TURN TO OTHER GODS AND SERVE THEM AND DESPISE ME AND BREAK MY COVENANT

AND WHEN MANY EVILS AND TROUBLES HAVE COME UPON THEM THIS SONG SHALL CONFRONT THEM AS A WITNESS FOR IT WILL LIVE UNFORGOTTEN IN THE MOUTHS OF THEIR OFFSPRING

FOR I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE INCLINED TO DO EVEN TODAY BEFORE I HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE

 SO MOSES WROTE THIS SONG THE SAME DAY AND TAUGHT IT TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE LORD COMMISSIONED JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND SAID BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS FOR YOU SHALL BRING THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL INTO THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE THEM

I WILL BE WITH YOU

 WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED WRITING THE WORDS OF THIS LAW IN A BOOK TO THE VERY END MOSES COMMANDED THE LEVITES WHO CARRIED THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TAKE THIS BOOK OF THE LAW AND PUT IT BY THE SIDE OF THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT IT MAY BE THERE FOR A WITNESS AGAINST YOU

FOR I KNOW HOW REBELLIOUS AND STUBBORN YOU ARE

BEHOLD EVEN TODAY WHILE I AM YET ALIVE WITH YOU YOU HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS AGAINST THE LORD

HOW MUCH MORE AFTER MY DEATH

ASSEMBLE TO ME ALL THE ELDERS OF YOUR TRIBES AND YOUR OFFICERS THAT I MAY SPEAK THESE WORDS IN THEIR EARS AND CALL HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST THEM

FOR I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL SURELY ACT CORRUPTLY AND TURN ASIDE FROM THE WAY THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

AND IN THE DAYS TO COME EVIL WILL BEFALL YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL DO WHAT IS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD PROVOKING HIM TO ANGER THROUGH THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

 THEN MOSES SPOKE THE WORDS OF THIS SONG UNTIL THEY WERE FINISHED IN THE EARS OF ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAELGIVE EAR O HEAVENS AND I WILL SPEAK AND LET THE EARTH HEAR THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

MAY MY TEACHING DROP AS THE RAIN MY SPEECH DISTILL AS THE DEW LIKE GENTLE RAIN UPON THE TENDER GRASS AND LIKE SHOWERS UPON THE HERB

FOR I WILL PROCLAIM THE NAME OF THE LORD; ASCRIBE GREATNESS TO OUR GOD

THE ROCK HIS WORK IS PERFECT FOR ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE

A GOD OF FAITHFULNESS AND WITHOUT INIQUITY JUST AND UPRIGHT IS HE

THEY HAVE DEALT CORRUPTLY WITH HIM; THEY ARE NO LONGER HIS CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY ARE BLEMISHED; THEY ARE A CROOKED AND TWISTED GENERATION

DO YOU THUS REPAY THE LORD YOU FOOLISH AND SENSELESS PEOPLE

IS NOT HE YOUR FATHER WHO CREATED YOU WHO MADE YOU AND ESTABLISHED YOU

REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD; CONSIDER THE YEARS OF MANY GENERATIONS; ASK YOUR FATHER AND HE WILL SHOW YOU YOUR ELDERS AND THEY WILL TELL YOU

WHEN THE MOST HIGH GAVE TO THE NATIONS THEIR INHERITANCE WHEN HE DIVIDED MANKIND HE FIXED THE BORDERS OF THE PEOPLES ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF GOD

BUT THE LORD'S PORTION IS HIS PEOPLE JACOB HIS ALLOTTED HERITAGE

HE FOUND HIM IN A DESERT LAND AND IN THE HOWLING WASTE OF THE WILDERNESS; HE ENCIRCLED HIM HE CARED FOR HIM HE KEPT HIM AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE

LIKE AN EAGLE THAT STIRS UP ITS NEST THAT FLUTTERS OVER ITS YOUNG SPREADING OUT ITS WINGS CATCHING THEM BEARING THEM ON ITS PINIONS THE LORD ALONE GUIDED HIM NO FOREIGN GOD WAS WITH HIM

HE MADE HIM RIDE ON THE HIGH PLACES OF THE LAND AND HE ATE THE PRODUCE OF THE FIELD AND HE SUCKLED HIM WITH HONEY OUT OF THE ROCK AND OIL OUT OF THE FLINTY ROCK

CURDS FROM THE HERD AND MILK FROM THE FLOCK WITH FAT OF LAMBS RAMS OF BASHAN AND GOATS WITH THE VERY FINEST OF THE WHEATAND YOU DRANK FOAMING WINE MADE FROM THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE

BUT JESHURUN GREW FAT AND KICKED; YOU GREW FAT STOUT AND SLEEK; THEN HE FORSOOK GOD WHO MADE HIM AND SCOFFED AT THE ROCK OF HIS SALVATION

THEY STIRRED HIM TO JEALOUSY WITH STRANGE GODS; WITH ABOMINATIONS THEY PROVOKED HIM TO ANGER

THEY SACRIFICED TO DEMONS THAT WERE NO GODS TO GODS THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN TO NEW GODS THAT HAD COME RECENTLY WHOM YOUR FATHERS HAD NEVER DREADED

YOU WERE UNMINDFUL OF THE ROCK THAT BORE YOU AND YOU FORGOT THE GOD WHO GAVE YOU BIRTH

THE LORD SAW IT AND SPURNED THEM BECAUSE OF THE PROVOCATION OF HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS

AND HE SAID 'I WILL HIDE MY FACE FROM THEM; I WILL SEE WHAT THEIR END WILL BE FOR THEY ARE A PERVERSE GENERATION CHILDREN IN WHOM IS NO FAITHFULNESS

THEY HAVE MADE ME JEALOUS WITH WHAT IS NO GOD; THEY HAVE PROVOKED ME TO ANGER WITH THEIR IDOLS

SO I WILL MAKE THEM JEALOUS WITH THOSE WHO ARE NO PEOPLE; I WILL PROVOKE THEM TO ANGER WITH A FOOLISH NATION

FOR A FIRE IS KINDLED BY MY ANGER AND IT BURNS TO THE DEPTHS OF SHEOL DEVOURS THE EARTH AND ITS INCREASE AND SETS ON FIRE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS

'AND I WILL HEAP DISASTERS UPON THEM; I WILL SPEND MY ARROWS ON THEM; THEY SHALL BE WASTED WITH HUNGER AND DEVOURED BY PLAGUE AND POISONOUS PESTILENCE; I WILL SEND THE TEETH OF BEASTS AGAINST THEM WITH THE VENOM OF THINGS THAT CRAWL IN THE DUST

OUTDOORS THE SWORD SHALL BEREAVE AND INDOORS TERROR FOR YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN ALIKE THE NURSING CHILD WITH THE MAN OF GRAY HAIRS

I WOULD HAVE SAID I WILL CUT THEM TO PIECES; I WILL WIPE THEM FROM HUMAN MEMORY HAD I NOT FEARED PROVOCATION BY THE ENEMY LEST THEIR ADVERSARIES SHOULD MISUNDERSTAND LEST THEY SHOULD SAY OUR HAND IS TRIUMPHANT IT WAS NOT THE LORD WHO DID ALL THIS

' FOR THEY ARE A NATION VOID OF COUNSEL AND THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING IN THEM

IF THEY WERE WISE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS; THEY WOULD DISCERN THEIR LATTER END

HOW COULD ONE HAVE CHASED A THOUSAND AND TWO HAVE PUT TEN THOUSAND TO FLIGHT UNLESS THEIR ROCK HAD SOLD THEM AND THE LORD HAD GIVEN THEM UP

FOR THEIR ROCK IS NOT AS OUR ROCK; OUR ENEMIES ARE BY THEMSELVES

FOR THEIR VINE COMES FROM THE VINE OF SODOM AND FROM THE FIELDS OF GOMORRAH; THEIR GRAPES ARE GRAPES OF POISON; THEIR CLUSTERS ARE BITTER; THEIR WINE IS THE POISON OF SERPENTS AND THE CRUEL VENOM OF ASPS

'IS NOT THIS LAID UP IN STORE WITH ME SEALED UP IN MY TREASURIES

VENGEANCE IS MINE AND RECOMPENSE FOR THE TIME WHEN THEIR FOOT SHALL SLIP; FOR THE DAY OF THEIR CALAMITY IS AT HAND AND THEIR DOOM COMES SWIFTLY

' FOR THE LORD WILL VINDICATE HIS PEOPLE AND HAVE COMPASSION ON HIS SERVANTS WHEN HE SEES THAT THEIR POWER IS GONE AND THERE IS NONE REMAINING BOND OR FREE

THEN HE WILL SAY 'WHERE ARE THEIR GODS THE ROCK IN WHICH THEY TOOK REFUGE WHO ATE THE FAT OF THEIR SACRIFICES AND DRANK THE WINE OF THEIR DRINK OFFERING

LET THEM RISE UP AND HELP YOU; LET THEM BE YOUR PROTECTION

'SEE NOW THAT I EVEN I AM HE AND THERE IS NO GOD BESIDE ME; I KILL AND I MAKE ALIVE; I WOUND AND I HEAL; AND THERE IS NONE THAT CAN DELIVER OUT OF MY HAND

FOR I LIFT UP MY HAND TO HEAVEN AND SWEAR AS I LIVE FOREVER IF I SHARPEN MY FLASHING SWORD AND MY HAND TAKES HOLD ON JUDGMENT I WILL TAKE VENGEANCE ON MY ADVERSARIES AND WILL REPAY THOSE WHO HATE ME

I WILL MAKE MY ARROWS DRUNK WITH BLOOD AND MY SWORD SHALL DEVOUR FLESHWITH THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN AND THE CAPTIVES FROM THE LONGHAIRED HEADS OF THE ENEMY

' REJOICE WITH HIM O HEAVENS; BOW DOWN TO HIM ALL GODS FOR HE AVENGES THE BLOOD OF HIS CHILDREN AND TAKES VENGEANCE ON HIS ADVERSARIES

HE REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM AND CLEANSES HIS PEOPLE'S LAND

 MOSES CAME AND RECITED ALL THE WORDS OF THIS SONG IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE HE AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN

AND WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED SPEAKING ALL THESE WORDS TO ALL ISRAEL HE SAID TO THEM TAKE TO HEART ALL THE WORDS BY WHICH I AM WARNING YOU TODAY THAT YOU MAY COMMAND THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN THAT THEY MAY BE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW

FOR IT IS NO EMPTY WORD FOR YOU BUT YOUR VERY LIFE AND BY THIS WORD YOU SHALL LIVE LONG IN THE LAND THAT YOU ARE GOING OVER THE JORDAN TO POSSESS

 THAT VERY DAY THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES GO UP THIS MOUNTAIN OF THE ABARIM MOUNT NEBO WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF MOAB OPPOSITE JERICHO AND VIEW THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH I AM GIVING TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FOR A POSSESSION

AND DIE ON THE MOUNTAIN WHICH YOU GO UP AND BE GATHERED TO YOUR PEOPLE AS AARON YOUR BROTHER DIED IN MOUNT HOR AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU BROKE FAITH WITH ME IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAHKADESH IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN AND BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TREAT ME AS HOLY IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

FOR YOU SHALL SEE THE LAND BEFORE YOU BUT YOU SHALL NOT GO THERE INTO THE LAND THAT I AM GIVING TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THIS IS THE BLESSING WITH WHICH MOSES THE MAN OF GOD BLESSED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BEFORE HIS DEATH

HE SAID THE LORD CAME FROM SINAI AND DAWNED FROM SEIR UPON US; HE SHONE FORTH FROM MOUNT PARAN; HE CAME FROM THE TEN THOUSANDS OF HOLY ONES WITH FLAMING FIRE AT HIS RIGHT HAND

YES HE LOVED HIS PEOPLE ALL HIS HOLY ONES WERE IN HIS HAND; SO THEY FOLLOWED IN YOUR STEPS RECEIVING DIRECTION FROM YOU WHEN MOSES COMMANDED US A LAW AS A POSSESSION FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF JACOB

THUS THE LORD BECAME KING IN JESHURUN WHEN THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE WERE GATHERED ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TOGETHER

LET REUBEN LIVE AND NOT DIE BUT LET HIS MEN BE FEW

 AND THIS HE SAID OF JUDAH HEAR O LORD THE VOICE OF JUDAH AND BRING HIM IN TO HIS PEOPLE

WITH YOUR HANDS CONTEND FOR HIM AND BE A HELP AGAINST HIS ADVERSARIES

 AND OF LEVI HE SAID GIVE TO LEVI YOUR THUMMIM AND YOUR URIM TO YOUR GODLY ONE WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH WITH WHOM YOU QUARRELED AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH; WHO SAID OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER 'I REGARD THEM NOT'; HE DISOWNED HIS BROTHERS AND IGNORED HIS CHILDREN

FOR THEY OBSERVED YOUR WORD AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT

THEY SHALL TEACH JACOB YOUR RULES AND ISRAEL YOUR LAW; THEY SHALL PUT INCENSE BEFORE YOU AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS ON YOUR ALTAR

BLESS O LORD HIS SUBSTANCE AND ACCEPT THE WORK OF HIS HANDS; CRUSH THE LOINS OF HIS ADVERSARIES OF THOSE WHO HATE HIM THAT THEY RISE NOT AGAIN

 OF BENJAMIN HE SAID THE BELOVED OF THE LORD DWELLS IN SAFETY

THE HIGH GOD SURROUNDS HIM ALL DAY LONG AND DWELLS BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS

 AND OF JOSEPH HE SAID BLESSED BY THE LORD BE HIS LAND WITH THE CHOICEST GIFTS OF HEAVEN ABOVE AND OF THE DEEP THAT CROUCHES BENEATH WITH THE CHOICEST FRUITS OF THE SUN AND THE RICH YIELD OF THE MONTHS WITH THE FINEST PRODUCE OF THE ANCIENT MOUNTAINS AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS WITH THE BEST GIFTS OF THE EARTH AND ITS FULLNESS AND THE FAVOR OF HIM WHO DWELLS IN THE BUSH

MAY THESE REST ON THE HEAD OF JOSEPH ON THE PATE OF HIM WHO IS PRINCE AMONG HIS BROTHERS

A FIRSTBORN BULLHE HAS MAJESTY AND HIS HORNS ARE THE HORNS OF A WILD OX; WITH THEM HE SHALL GORE THE PEOPLES ALL OF THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH; THEY ARE THE TEN THOUSANDS OF EPHRAIM AND THEY ARE THE THOUSANDS OF MANASSEH

 AND OF ZEBULUN HE SAID REJOICE ZEBULUN IN YOUR GOING OUT AND ISSACHAR IN YOUR TENTS

THEY SHALL CALL PEOPLES TO THEIR MOUNTAIN; THERE THEY OFFER RIGHT SACRIFICES; FOR THEY DRAW FROM THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SEAS AND THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF THE SAND

 AND OF GAD HE SAID BLESSED BE HE WHO ENLARGES GAD

GAD CROUCHES LIKE A LION; HE TEARS OFF ARM AND SCALP

HE CHOSE THE BEST OF THE LAND FOR HIMSELF FOR THERE A COMMANDER'S PORTION WAS RESERVED; AND HE CAME WITH THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE WITH ISRAEL HE EXECUTED THE JUSTICE OF THE LORD AND HIS JUDGMENTS FOR ISRAEL

 AND OF DAN HE SAID DAN IS A LION'S CUB THAT LEAPS FROM BASHAN

 AND OF NAPHTALI HE SAID O NAPHTALI SATED WITH FAVOR AND FULL OF THE BLESSING OF THE LORD POSSESS THE LAKE AND THE SOUTH

 AND OF ASHER HE SAID MOST BLESSED OF SONS BE ASHER; LET HIM BE THE FAVORITE OF HIS BROTHERS AND LET HIM DIP HIS FOOT IN OIL

YOUR BARS SHALL BE IRON AND BRONZE AND AS YOUR DAYS SO SHALL YOUR STRENGTH BE

THERE IS NONE LIKE GOD O JESHURUN WHO RIDES THROUGH THE HEAVENS TO YOUR HELP THROUGH THE SKIES IN HIS MAJESTY

THE ETERNAL GOD IS YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND UNDERNEATH ARE THE EVERLASTING ARMS

AND HE THRUST OUT THE ENEMY BEFORE YOU AND SAID DESTROY

SO ISRAEL LIVED IN SAFETY JACOB LIVED ALONE IN A LAND OF GRAIN AND WINE WHOSE HEAVENS DROP DOWN DEW

HAPPY ARE YOU O ISRAEL

WHO IS LIKE YOU A PEOPLE SAVED BY THE LORD THE SHIELD OF YOUR HELP AND THE SWORD OF YOUR TRIUMPH

YOUR ENEMIES SHALL COME FAWNING TO YOU AND YOU SHALL TREAD UPON THEIR BACKS

THEN MOSES WENT UP FROM THE PLAINS OF MOAB TO MOUNT NEBO TO THE TOP OF PISGAH WHICH IS OPPOSITE JERICHO

AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM ALL THE LAND GILEAD AS FAR AS DAN ALL NAPHTALI THE LAND OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH ALL THE LAND OF JUDAH AS FAR AS THE WESTERN SEA THE NEGEB AND THE PLAIN THAT IS THE VALLEY OF JERICHO THE CITY OF PALM TREES AS FAR AS ZOAR

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM THIS IS THE LAND OF WHICH I SWORE TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB 'I WILL GIVE IT TO YOUR OFFSPRING

' I HAVE LET YOU SEE IT WITH YOUR EYES BUT YOU SHALL NOT GO OVER THERE

 SO MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE IN THE LAND OF MOAB ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD AND HE BURIED HIM IN THE VALLEY IN THE LAND OF MOAB OPPOSITE BETHPEOR; BUT NO ONE KNOWS THE PLACE OF HIS BURIAL TO THIS DAY

MOSES WAS  YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED

HIS EYE WAS UNDIMMED AND HIS VIGOR UNABATED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WEPT FOR MOSES IN THE PLAINS OF MOAB THIRTY DAYS

THEN THE DAYS OF WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR MOSES WERE ENDED

AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN WAS FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM FOR MOSES HAD LAID HIS HANDS ON HIM

SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OBEYED HIM AND DID AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES

AND THERE HAS NOT ARISEN A PROPHET SINCE IN ISRAEL LIKE MOSES WHOM THE LORD KNEW FACE TO FACE NONE LIKE HIM FOR ALL THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS THAT THE LORD SENT HIM TO DO IN THE LAND OF EGYPT TO PHARAOH AND TO ALL HIS SERVANTS AND TO ALL HIS LAND AND FOR ALL THE MIGHTY POWER AND ALL THE GREAT DEEDS OF TERROR THAT MOSES DID IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL

HAGGAIIN THE SECOND YEAR OF DARIUS THE KING IN THE SIXTH MONTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME BY THE HAND OF HAGGAI THE PROPHET TO ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL GOVERNOR OF JUDAH AND TO JOSHUA THE SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THESE PEOPLE SAY THE TIME HAS NOT YET COME TO REBUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME BY THE HAND OF HAGGAI THE PROPHET IS IT A TIME FOR YOU YOURSELVES TO DWELL IN YOUR PANELED HOUSES WHILE THIS HOUSE LIES IN RUINS

NOW THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CONSIDER YOUR WAYS

YOU HAVE SOWN MUCH AND HARVESTED LITTLE

YOU EAT BUT YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH; YOU DRINK BUT YOU NEVER HAVE YOUR FILL

YOU CLOTHE YOURSELVES BUT NO ONE IS WARM

AND HE WHO EARNS WAGES DOES SO TO PUT THEM INTO A BAG WITH HOLES

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CONSIDER YOUR WAYS

GO UP TO THE HILLS AND BRING WOOD AND BUILD THE HOUSE THAT I MAY TAKE PLEASURE IN IT AND THAT I MAY BE GLORIFIED SAYS THE LORD

YOU LOOKED FOR MUCH AND BEHOLD IT CAME TO LITTLE

AND WHEN YOU BROUGHT IT HOME I BLEW IT AWAY

WHY

DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

BECAUSE OF MY HOUSE THAT LIES IN RUINS WHILE EACH OF YOU BUSIES HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN HOUSE

THEREFORE THE HEAVENS ABOVE YOU HAVE WITHHELD THE DEW AND THE EARTH HAS WITHHELD ITS PRODUCE

AND I HAVE CALLED FOR A DROUGHT ON THE LAND AND THE HILLS ON THE GRAIN THE NEW WINE THE OIL ON WHAT THE GROUND BRINGS FORTH ON MAN AND BEAST AND ON ALL THEIR LABORS

 THEN ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL AND JOSHUA THE SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST WITH ALL THE REMNANT OF THE PEOPLE OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD THEIR GOD AND THE WORDS OF HAGGAI THE PROPHET AS THE LORD THEIR GOD HAD SENT HIM

AND THE PEOPLE FEARED THE LORD

THEN HAGGAI THE MESSENGER OF THE LORD SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE WITH THE LORD'S MESSAGE I AM WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD

 AND THE LORD STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL GOVERNOR OF JUDAH AND THE SPIRIT OF JOSHUA THE SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE SPIRIT OF ALL THE REMNANT OF THE PEOPLE

AND THEY CAME AND WORKED ON THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THEIR GOD ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE MONTH IN THE SIXTH MONTH IN THE SECOND YEAR OF DARIUS THE KING

IN THE SEVENTH MONTH ON THE TWENTYFIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME BY THE HAND OF HAGGAI THE PROPHET SPEAK NOW TO ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL GOVERNOR OF JUDAH AND TO JOSHUA THE SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST AND TO ALL THE REMNANT OF THE PEOPLE AND SAY 'WHO IS LEFT AMONG YOU WHO SAW THIS HOUSE IN ITS FORMER GLORY

HOW DO YOU SEE IT NOW

IS IT NOT AS NOTHING IN YOUR EYES

YET NOW BE STRONG O ZERUBBABEL DECLARES THE LORD

BE STRONG O JOSHUA SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST

BE STRONG ALL YOU PEOPLE OF THE LAND DECLARES THE LORD

WORK FOR I AM WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH YOU WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF EGYPT

MY SPIRIT REMAINS IN YOUR MIDST

FEAR NOT

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS YET ONCE MORE IN A LITTLE WHILE I WILL SHAKE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND THE DRY LAND

AND I WILL SHAKE ALL NATIONS SO THAT THE TREASURES OF ALL NATIONS SHALL COME IN AND I WILL FILL THIS HOUSE WITH GLORY SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

THE SILVER IS MINE AND THE GOLD IS MINE DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

THE LATTER GLORY OF THIS HOUSE SHALL BE GREATER THAN THE FORMER SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND IN THIS PLACE I WILL GIVE PEACE DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

' ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE NINTH MONTH IN THE SECOND YEAR OF DARIUS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME BY HAGGAI THE PROPHET THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS ASK THE PRIESTS ABOUT THE LAW 'IF SOMEONE CARRIES HOLY MEAT IN THE FOLD OF HIS GARMENT AND TOUCHES WITH HIS FOLD BREAD OR STEW OR WINE OR OIL OR ANY KIND OF FOOD DOES IT BECOME HOLY

' THE PRIESTS ANSWERED AND SAID NO

 THEN HAGGAI SAID IF SOMEONE WHO IS UNCLEAN BY CONTACT WITH A DEAD BODY TOUCHES ANY OF THESE DOES IT BECOME UNCLEAN

 THE PRIESTS ANSWERED AND SAID IT DOES BECOME UNCLEAN

 THEN HAGGAI ANSWERED AND SAID SO IS IT WITH THIS PEOPLE AND WITH THIS NATION BEFORE ME DECLARES THE LORD AND SO WITH EVERY WORK OF THEIR HANDS

AND WHAT THEY OFFER THERE IS UNCLEAN

NOW THEN CONSIDER FROM THIS DAY ONWARD

BEFORE STONE WAS PLACED UPON STONE IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD HOW DID YOU FARE

WHEN ONE CAME TO A HEAP OF TWENTY MEASURES THERE WERE BUT TEN

WHEN ONE CAME TO THE WINE VAT TO DRAW FIFTY MEASURES THERE WERE BUT TWENTY

I STRUCK YOU AND ALL THE PRODUCTS OF YOUR TOIL WITH BLIGHT AND WITH MILDEW AND WITH HAIL YET YOU DID NOT TURN TO ME DECLARES THE LORD

CONSIDER FROM THIS DAY ONWARD FROM THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE NINTH MONTH

SINCE THE DAY THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THE LORD'S TEMPLE WAS LAID CONSIDER IS THE SEED YET IN THE BARN

INDEED THE VINE THE FIG TREE THE POMEGRANATE AND THE OLIVE TREE HAVE YIELDED NOTHING

BUT FROM THIS DAY ON I WILL BLESS YOU

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME A SECOND TIME TO HAGGAI ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE MONTH SPEAK TO ZERUBBABEL GOVERNOR OF JUDAH SAYING I AM ABOUT TO SHAKE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND TO OVERTHROW THE THRONE OF KINGDOMS

I AM ABOUT TO DESTROY THE STRENGTH OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE NATIONS AND OVERTHROW THE CHARIOTS AND THEIR RIDERS

AND THE HORSES AND THEIR RIDERS SHALL GO DOWN EVERY ONE BY THE SWORD OF HIS BROTHER

ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS I WILL TAKE YOU O ZERUBBABEL MY SERVANT THE SON OF SHEALTIEL DECLARES THE LORD AND MAKE YOU LIKE A SIGNET RING FOR I HAVE CHOSEN YOU DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

 JOHNTHE ELDER TO THE BELOVED GAIUS WHOM I LOVE IN TRUTH

BELOVED I PRAY THAT ALL MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY BE IN GOOD HEALTH AS IT GOES WELL WITH YOUR SOUL

FOR I REJOICED GREATLY WHEN THE BROTHERS CAME AND TESTIFIED TO YOUR TRUTH AS INDEED YOU ARE WALKING IN THE TRUTH

I HAVE NO GREATER JOY THAN TO HEAR THAT MY CHILDREN ARE WALKING IN THE TRUTH

BELOVED IT IS A FAITHFUL THING YOU DO IN ALL YOUR EFFORTS FOR THESE BROTHERS STRANGERS AS THEY ARE WHO TESTIFIED TO YOUR LOVE BEFORE THE CHURCH

YOU WILL DO WELL TO SEND THEM ON THEIR JOURNEY IN A MANNER WORTHY OF GOD

FOR THEY HAVE GONE OUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE NAME ACCEPTING NOTHING FROM THE GENTILES

THEREFORE WE OUGHT TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE THESE THAT WE MAY BE FELLOW WORKERS FOR THE TRUTH

I HAVE WRITTEN SOMETHING TO THE CHURCH BUT DIOTREPHES WHO LIKES TO PUT HIMSELF FIRST DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OUR AUTHORITY

SO IF I COME I WILL BRING UP WHAT HE IS DOING TALKING WICKED NONSENSE AGAINST US

AND NOT CONTENT WITH THAT HE REFUSES TO WELCOME THE BROTHERS AND ALSO STOPS THOSE WHO WANT TO AND PUTS THEM OUT OF THE CHURCH

BELOVED DO NOT IMITATE EVIL BUT IMITATE GOOD

WHOEVER DOES GOOD IS FROM GOD; WHOEVER DOES EVIL HAS NOT SEEN GOD

DEMETRIUS HAS RECEIVED A GOOD TESTIMONY FROM EVERYONE AND FROM THE TRUTH ITSELF

WE ALSO ADD OUR TESTIMONY AND YOU KNOW THAT OUR TESTIMONY IS TRUE

I HAD MUCH TO WRITE TO YOU BUT I WOULD RATHER NOT WRITE WITH PEN AND INK

I HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON AND WE WILL TALK FACE TO FACE

 KINGSNOW KING DAVID WAS OLD AND ADVANCED IN YEARS

AND ALTHOUGH THEY COVERED HIM WITH CLOTHES HE COULD NOT GET WARM

THEREFORE HIS SERVANTS SAID TO HIM LET A YOUNG WOMAN BE SOUGHT FOR MY LORD THE KING AND LET HER WAIT ON THE KING AND BE IN HIS SERVICE

LET HER LIE IN YOUR ARMS THAT MY LORD THE KING MAY BE WARM

 SO THEY SOUGHT FOR A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN THROUGHOUT ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL AND FOUND ABISHAG THE SHUNAMMITE AND BROUGHT HER TO THE KING

THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SHE WAS OF SERVICE TO THE KING AND ATTENDED TO HIM BUT THE KING KNEW HER NOT

NOW ADONIJAH THE SON OF HAGGITH EXALTED HIMSELF SAYING I WILL BE KING

 AND HE PREPARED FOR HIMSELF CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND FIFTY MEN TO RUN BEFORE HIM

HIS FATHER HAD NEVER AT ANY TIME DISPLEASED HIM BY ASKING WHY HAVE YOU DONE THUS AND SO

 HE WAS ALSO A VERY HANDSOME MAN AND HE WAS BORN NEXT AFTER ABSALOM

HE CONFERRED WITH JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH AND WITH ABIATHAR THE PRIEST

AND THEY FOLLOWED ADONIJAH AND HELPED HIM

BUT ZADOK THE PRIEST AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND NATHAN THE PROPHET AND SHIMEI AND REI AND DAVID'S MIGHTY MEN WERE NOT WITH ADONIJAH

ADONIJAH SACRIFICED SHEEP OXEN AND FATTENED CATTLE BY THE SERPENT'S STONE WHICH IS BESIDE ENROGEL AND HE INVITED ALL HIS BROTHERS THE KING'S SONS AND ALL THE ROYAL OFFICIALS OF JUDAH BUT HE DID NOT INVITE NATHAN THE PROPHET OR BENAIAH OR THE MIGHTY MEN OR SOLOMON HIS BROTHER

THEN NATHAN SAID TO BATHSHEBA THE MOTHER OF SOLOMON HAVE YOU NOT HEARD THAT ADONIJAH THE SON OF HAGGITH HAS BECOME KING AND DAVID OUR LORD DOES NOT KNOW IT

NOW THEREFORE COME LET ME GIVE YOU ADVICE THAT YOU MAY SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE AND THE LIFE OF YOUR SON SOLOMON

GO IN AT ONCE TO KING DAVID AND SAY TO HIM 'DID YOU NOT MY LORD THE KING SWEAR TO YOUR SERVANT SAYING SOLOMON YOUR SON SHALL REIGN AFTER ME AND HE SHALL SIT ON MY THRONE

WHY THEN IS ADONIJAH KING

' THEN WHILE YOU ARE STILL SPEAKING WITH THE KING I ALSO WILL COME IN AFTER YOU AND CONFIRM YOUR WORDS

 SO BATHSHEBA WENT TO THE KING IN HIS CHAMBER NOW THE KING WAS VERY OLD AND ABISHAG THE SHUNAMMITE WAS ATTENDING TO THE KING

BATHSHEBA BOWED AND PAID HOMAGE TO THE KING AND THE KING SAID WHAT DO YOU DESIRE

 SHE SAID TO HIM MY LORD YOU SWORE TO YOUR SERVANT BY THE LORD YOUR GOD SAYING 'SOLOMON YOUR SON SHALL REIGN AFTER ME AND HE SHALL SIT ON MY THRONE

' AND NOW BEHOLD ADONIJAH IS KING ALTHOUGH YOU MY LORD THE KING DO NOT KNOW IT

HE HAS SACRIFICED OXEN FATTENED CATTLE AND SHEEP IN ABUNDANCE AND HAS INVITED ALL THE SONS OF THE KING ABIATHAR THE PRIEST AND JOAB THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY BUT SOLOMON YOUR SERVANT HE HAS NOT INVITED

AND NOW MY LORD THE KING THE EYES OF ALL ISRAEL ARE ON YOU TO TELL THEM WHO SHALL SIT ON THE THRONE OF MY LORD THE KING AFTER HIM

OTHERWISE IT WILL COME TO PASS WHEN MY LORD THE KING SLEEPS WITH HIS FATHERS THAT I AND MY SON SOLOMON WILL BE COUNTED OFFENDERS

 WHILE SHE WAS STILL SPEAKING WITH THE KING NATHAN THE PROPHET CAME IN

AND THEY TOLD THE KING HERE IS NATHAN THE PROPHET

 AND WHEN HE CAME IN BEFORE THE KING HE BOWED BEFORE THE KING WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND

AND NATHAN SAID MY LORD THE KING HAVE YOU SAID 'ADONIJAH SHALL REIGN AFTER ME AND HE SHALL SIT ON MY THRONE'

FOR HE HAS GONE DOWN THIS DAY AND HAS SACRIFICED OXEN FATTENED CATTLE AND SHEEP IN ABUNDANCE AND HAS INVITED ALL THE KING'S SONS THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY AND ABIATHAR THE PRIEST

AND BEHOLD THEY ARE EATING AND DRINKING BEFORE HIM AND SAYING 'LONG LIVE KING ADONIJAH

' BUT ME YOUR SERVANT AND ZADOK THE PRIEST AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND YOUR SERVANT SOLOMON HE HAS NOT INVITED

HAS THIS THING BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY MY LORD THE KING AND YOU HAVE NOT TOLD YOUR SERVANTS WHO SHOULD SIT ON THE THRONE OF MY LORD THE KING AFTER HIM

 THEN KING DAVID ANSWERED CALL BATHSHEBA TO ME

 SO SHE CAME INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING

AND THE KING SWORE SAYING AS THE LORD LIVES WHO HAS REDEEMED MY SOUL OUT OF EVERY ADVERSITY AS I SWORE TO YOU BY THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL SAYING 'SOLOMON YOUR SON SHALL REIGN AFTER ME AND HE SHALL SIT ON MY THRONE IN MY PLACE' EVEN SO WILL I DO THIS DAY

 THEN BATHSHEBA BOWED WITH HER FACE TO THE GROUND AND PAID HOMAGE TO THE KING AND SAID MAY MY LORD KING DAVID LIVE FOREVER

 KING DAVID SAID CALL TO ME ZADOK THE PRIEST NATHAN THE PROPHET AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA

 SO THEY CAME BEFORE THE KING

AND THE KING SAID TO THEM TAKE WITH YOU THE SERVANTS OF YOUR LORD AND HAVE SOLOMON MY SON RIDE ON MY OWN MULE AND BRING HIM DOWN TO GIHON

AND LET ZADOK THE PRIEST AND NATHAN THE PROPHET THERE ANOINT HIM KING OVER ISRAEL

THEN BLOW THE TRUMPET AND SAY 'LONG LIVE KING SOLOMON

' YOU SHALL THEN COME UP AFTER HIM AND HE SHALL COME AND SIT ON MY THRONE FOR HE SHALL BE KING IN MY PLACE

AND I HAVE APPOINTED HIM TO BE RULER OVER ISRAEL AND OVER JUDAH

 AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA ANSWERED THE KING AMEN

MAY THE LORD THE GOD OF MY LORD THE KING SAY SO

AS THE LORD HAS BEEN WITH MY LORD THE KING EVEN SO MAY HE BE WITH SOLOMON AND MAKE HIS THRONE GREATER THAN THE THRONE OF MY LORD KING DAVID

 SO ZADOK THE PRIEST NATHAN THE PROPHET AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES WENT DOWN AND HAD SOLOMON RIDE ON KING DAVID'S MULE AND BROUGHT HIM TO GIHON

THERE ZADOK THE PRIEST TOOK THE HORN OF OIL FROM THE TENT AND ANOINTED SOLOMON

THEN THEY BLEW THE TRUMPET AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID LONG LIVE KING SOLOMON

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE WENT UP AFTER HIM PLAYING ON PIPES AND REJOICING WITH GREAT JOY SO THAT THE EARTH WAS SPLIT BY THEIR NOISE

ADONIJAH AND ALL THE GUESTS WHO WERE WITH HIM HEARD IT AS THEY FINISHED FEASTING

AND WHEN JOAB HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET HE SAID WHAT DOES THIS UPROAR IN THE CITY MEAN

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING BEHOLD JONATHAN THE SON OF ABIATHAR THE PRIEST CAME

AND ADONIJAH SAID COME IN FOR YOU ARE A WORTHY MAN AND BRING GOOD NEWS

 JONATHAN ANSWERED ADONIJAH NO FOR OUR LORD KING DAVID HAS MADE SOLOMON KING AND THE KING HAS SENT WITH HIM ZADOK THE PRIEST NATHAN THE PROPHET AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES

AND THEY HAD HIM RIDE ON THE KING'S MULE

AND ZADOK THE PRIEST AND NATHAN THE PROPHET HAVE ANOINTED HIM KING AT GIHON AND THEY HAVE GONE UP FROM THERE REJOICING SO THAT THE CITY IS IN AN UPROAR

THIS IS THE NOISE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD

SOLOMON SITS ON THE ROYAL THRONE

MOREOVER THE KING'S SERVANTS CAME TO CONGRATULATE OUR LORD KING DAVID SAYING 'MAY YOUR GOD MAKE THE NAME OF SOLOMON MORE FAMOUS THAN YOURS AND MAKE HIS THRONE GREATER THAN YOUR THRONE

' AND THE KING BOWED HIMSELF ON THE BED

AND THE KING ALSO SAID 'BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO HAS GRANTED SOMEONE TO SIT ON MY THRONE THIS DAY MY OWN EYES SEEING IT

' THEN ALL THE GUESTS OF ADONIJAH TREMBLED AND ROSE AND EACH WENT HIS OWN WAY

AND ADONIJAH FEARED SOLOMON

SO HE AROSE AND WENT AND TOOK HOLD OF THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR

THEN IT WAS TOLD SOLOMON BEHOLD ADONIJAH FEARS KING SOLOMON FOR BEHOLD HE HAS LAID HOLD OF THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR SAYING 'LET KING SOLOMON SWEAR TO ME FIRST THAT HE WILL NOT PUT HIS SERVANT TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD

' AND SOLOMON SAID IF HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF A WORTHY MAN NOT ONE OF HIS HAIRS SHALL FALL TO THE EARTH BUT IF WICKEDNESS IS FOUND IN HIM HE SHALL DIE

 SO KING SOLOMON SENT AND THEY BROUGHT HIM DOWN FROM THE ALTAR

AND HE CAME AND PAID HOMAGE TO KING SOLOMON AND SOLOMON SAID TO HIM GO TO YOUR HOUSE

WHEN DAVID'S TIME TO DIE DREW NEAR HE COMMANDED SOLOMON HIS SON SAYING I AM ABOUT TO GO THE WAY OF ALL THE EARTH

BE STRONG AND SHOW YOURSELF A MAN AND KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WALKING IN HIS WAYS AND KEEPING HIS STATUTES HIS COMMANDMENTS HIS RULES AND HIS TESTIMONIES AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES THAT YOU MAY PROSPER IN ALL THAT YOU DO AND WHEREVER YOU TURN THAT THE LORD MAY ESTABLISH HIS WORD THAT HE SPOKE CONCERNING ME SAYING 'IF YOUR SONS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THEIR WAY TO WALK BEFORE ME IN FAITHFULNESS WITH ALL THEIR HEART AND WITH ALL THEIR SOUL YOU SHALL NOT LACK A MAN ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL

' MOREOVER YOU ALSO KNOW WHAT JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH DID TO ME HOW HE DEALT WITH THE TWO COMMANDERS OF THE ARMIES OF ISRAEL ABNER THE SON OF NER AND AMASA THE SON OF JETHER WHOM HE KILLED AVENGING IN TIME OF PEACE FOR BLOOD THAT HAD BEEN SHED IN WAR AND PUTTING THE BLOOD OF WAR ON THE BELT AROUND HIS WAIST AND ON THE SANDALS ON HIS FEET

ACT THEREFORE ACCORDING TO YOUR WISDOM BUT DO NOT LET HIS GRAY HEAD GO DOWN TO SHEOL IN PEACE

BUT DEAL LOYALLY WITH THE SONS OF BARZILLAI THE GILEADITE AND LET THEM BE AMONG THOSE WHO EAT AT YOUR TABLE FOR WITH SUCH LOYALTY THEY MET ME WHEN I FLED FROM ABSALOM YOUR BROTHER

AND THERE IS ALSO WITH YOU SHIMEI THE SON OF GERA THE BENJAMINITE FROM BAHURIM WHO CURSED ME WITH A GRIEVOUS CURSE ON THE DAY WHEN I WENT TO MAHANAIM

BUT WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO MEET ME AT THE JORDAN I SWORE TO HIM BY THE LORD SAYING 'I WILL NOT PUT YOU TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD

' NOW THEREFORE DO NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS FOR YOU ARE A WISE MAN

YOU WILL KNOW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO TO HIM AND YOU SHALL BRING HIS GRAY HEAD DOWN WITH BLOOD TO SHEOL

 THEN DAVID SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN THE CITY OF DAVID

AND THE TIME THAT DAVID REIGNED OVER ISRAEL WAS FORTY YEARS

HE REIGNED SEVEN YEARS IN HEBRON AND THIRTYTHREE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

SO SOLOMON SAT ON THE THRONE OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND HIS KINGDOM WAS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED

THEN ADONIJAH THE SON OF HAGGITH CAME TO BATHSHEBA THE MOTHER OF SOLOMON

AND SHE SAID DO YOU COME PEACEFULLY

 HE SAID PEACEFULLY

 THEN HE SAID I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU

 SHE SAID SPEAK

 HE SAID YOU KNOW THAT THE KINGDOM WAS MINE AND THAT ALL ISRAEL FULLY EXPECTED ME TO REIGN

HOWEVER THE KINGDOM HAS TURNED ABOUT AND BECOME MY BROTHER'S FOR IT WAS HIS FROM THE LORD

AND NOW I HAVE ONE REQUEST TO MAKE OF YOU; DO NOT REFUSE ME

 SHE SAID TO HIM SPEAK

 AND HE SAID PLEASE ASK KING SOLOMONHE WILL NOT REFUSE YOUTO GIVE ME ABISHAG THE SHUNAMMITE AS MY WIFE

 BATHSHEBA SAID VERY WELL; I WILL SPEAK FOR YOU TO THE KING

 SO BATHSHEBA WENT TO KING SOLOMON TO SPEAK TO HIM ON BEHALF OF ADONIJAH

AND THE KING ROSE TO MEET HER AND BOWED DOWN TO HER

THEN HE SAT ON HIS THRONE AND HAD A SEAT BROUGHT FOR THE KING'S MOTHER AND SHE SAT ON HIS RIGHT

THEN SHE SAID I HAVE ONE SMALL REQUEST TO MAKE OF YOU; DO NOT REFUSE ME

 AND THE KING SAID TO HER MAKE YOUR REQUEST MY MOTHER FOR I WILL NOT REFUSE YOU

 SHE SAID LET ABISHAG THE SHUNAMMITE BE GIVEN TO ADONIJAH YOUR BROTHER AS HIS WIFE

 KING SOLOMON ANSWERED HIS MOTHER AND WHY DO YOU ASK ABISHAG THE SHUNAMMITE FOR ADONIJAH

ASK FOR HIM THE KINGDOM ALSO FOR HE IS MY OLDER BROTHER AND ON HIS SIDE ARE ABIATHAR THE PRIEST AND JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH

 THEN KING SOLOMON SWORE BY THE LORD SAYING GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF THIS WORD DOES NOT COST ADONIJAH HIS LIFE

NOW THEREFORE AS THE LORD LIVES WHO HAS ESTABLISHED ME AND PLACED ME ON THE THRONE OF DAVID MY FATHER AND WHO HAS MADE ME A HOUSE AS HE PROMISED ADONIJAH SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH THIS DAY

 SO KING SOLOMON SENT BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND HE STRUCK HIM DOWN AND HE DIED

AND TO ABIATHAR THE PRIEST THE KING SAID GO TO ANATHOTH TO YOUR ESTATE FOR YOU DESERVE DEATH

BUT I WILL NOT AT THIS TIME PUT YOU TO DEATH BECAUSE YOU CARRIED THE ARK OF THE LORD GOD BEFORE DAVID MY FATHER AND BECAUSE YOU SHARED IN ALL MY FATHER'S AFFLICTION

 SO SOLOMON EXPELLED ABIATHAR FROM BEING PRIEST TO THE LORD THUS FULFILLING THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE HAD SPOKEN CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF ELI IN SHILOH

WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO JOABFOR JOAB HAD SUPPORTED ADONIJAH ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SUPPORTED ABSALOMJOAB FLED TO THE TENT OF THE LORD AND CAUGHT HOLD OF THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD KING SOLOMON JOAB HAS FLED TO THE TENT OF THE LORD AND BEHOLD HE IS BESIDE THE ALTAR SOLOMON SENT BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA SAYING GO STRIKE HIM DOWN

 SO BENAIAH CAME TO THE TENT OF THE LORD AND SAID TO HIM THE KING COMMANDS 'COME OUT

' BUT HE SAID NO I WILL DIE HERE

 THEN BENAIAH BROUGHT THE KING WORD AGAIN SAYING THUS SAID JOAB AND THUS HE ANSWERED ME

 THE KING REPLIED TO HIM DO AS HE HAS SAID STRIKE HIM DOWN AND BURY HIM AND THUS TAKE AWAY FROM ME AND FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE THE GUILT FOR THE BLOOD THAT JOAB SHED WITHOUT CAUSE

THE LORD WILL BRING BACK HIS BLOODY DEEDS ON HIS OWN HEAD BECAUSE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY FATHER DAVID HE ATTACKED AND KILLED WITH THE SWORD TWO MEN MORE RIGHTEOUS AND BETTER THAN HIMSELF ABNER THE SON OF NER COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF ISRAEL AND AMASA THE SON OF JETHER COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF JUDAH

SO SHALL THEIR BLOOD COME BACK ON THE HEAD OF JOAB AND ON THE HEAD OF HIS DESCENDANTS FOREVER

BUT FOR DAVID AND FOR HIS DESCENDANTS AND FOR HIS HOUSE AND FOR HIS THRONE THERE SHALL BE PEACE FROM THE LORD FOREVERMORE

 THEN BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WENT UP AND STRUCK HIM DOWN AND PUT HIM TO DEATH

AND HE WAS BURIED IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE WILDERNESS

THE KING PUT BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA OVER THE ARMY IN PLACE OF JOAB AND THE KING PUT ZADOK THE PRIEST IN THE PLACE OF ABIATHAR

THEN THE KING SENT AND SUMMONED SHIMEI AND SAID TO HIM BUILD YOURSELF A HOUSE IN JERUSALEM AND DWELL THERE AND DO NOT GO OUT FROM THERE TO ANY PLACE WHATEVER

FOR ON THE DAY YOU GO OUT AND CROSS THE BROOK KIDRON KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOU SHALL DIE

YOUR BLOOD SHALL BE ON YOUR OWN HEAD

 AND SHIMEI SAID TO THE KING WHAT YOU SAY IS GOOD; AS MY LORD THE KING HAS SAID SO WILL YOUR SERVANT DO

 SO SHIMEI LIVED IN JERUSALEM MANY DAYS

BUT IT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THREE YEARS THAT TWO OF SHIMEI'S SERVANTS RAN AWAY TO ACHISH SON OF MAACAH KING OF GATH

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD SHIMEI BEHOLD YOUR SERVANTS ARE IN GATH SHIMEI AROSE AND SADDLED A DONKEY AND WENT TO GATH TO ACHISH TO SEEK HIS SERVANTS

SHIMEI WENT AND BROUGHT HIS SERVANTS FROM GATH

AND WHEN SOLOMON WAS TOLD THAT SHIMEI HAD GONE FROM JERUSALEM TO GATH AND RETURNED THE KING SENT AND SUMMONED SHIMEI AND SAID TO HIM DID I NOT MAKE YOU SWEAR BY THE LORD AND SOLEMNLY WARN YOU SAYING 'KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT ON THE DAY YOU GO OUT AND GO TO ANY PLACE WHATEVER YOU SHALL DIE'

AND YOU SAID TO ME 'WHAT YOU SAY IS GOOD; I WILL OBEY

' WHY THEN HAVE YOU NOT KEPT YOUR OATH TO THE LORD AND THE COMMANDMENT WITH WHICH I COMMANDED YOU

 THE KING ALSO SAID TO SHIMEI YOU KNOW IN YOUR OWN HEART ALL THE HARM THAT YOU DID TO DAVID MY FATHER

SO THE LORD WILL BRING BACK YOUR HARM ON YOUR OWN HEAD

BUT KING SOLOMON SHALL BE BLESSED AND THE THRONE OF DAVID SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE LORD FOREVER

 THEN THE KING COMMANDED BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND HE WENT OUT AND STRUCK HIM DOWN AND HE DIED

SO THE KINGDOM WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE HAND OF SOLOMON

SOLOMON MADE A MARRIAGE ALLIANCE WITH PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT

HE TOOK PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER AND BROUGHT HER INTO THE CITY OF DAVID UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED BUILDING HIS OWN HOUSE AND THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE WALL AROUND JERUSALEM

THE PEOPLE WERE SACRIFICING AT THE HIGH PLACES HOWEVER BECAUSE NO HOUSE HAD YET BEEN BUILT FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD

SOLOMON LOVED THE LORD WALKING IN THE STATUTES OF DAVID HIS FATHER ONLY HE SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS AT THE HIGH PLACES

AND THE KING WENT TO GIBEON TO SACRIFICE THERE FOR THAT WAS THE GREAT HIGH PLACE

SOLOMON USED TO OFFER A THOUSAND BURNT OFFERINGS ON THAT ALTAR

AT GIBEON THE LORD APPEARED TO SOLOMON IN A DREAM BY NIGHT AND GOD SAID ASK WHAT I SHALL GIVE YOU

 AND SOLOMON SAID YOU HAVE SHOWN GREAT AND STEADFAST LOVE TO YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER BECAUSE HE WALKED BEFORE YOU IN FAITHFULNESS IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IN UPRIGHTNESS OF HEART TOWARD YOU

AND YOU HAVE KEPT FOR HIM THIS GREAT AND STEADFAST LOVE AND HAVE GIVEN HIM A SON TO SIT ON HIS THRONE THIS DAY

AND NOW O LORD MY GOD YOU HAVE MADE YOUR SERVANT KING IN PLACE OF DAVID MY FATHER ALTHOUGH I AM BUT A LITTLE CHILD

I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GO OUT OR COME IN

AND YOUR SERVANT IS IN THE MIDST OF YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE CHOSEN A GREAT PEOPLE TOO MANY TO BE NUMBERED OR COUNTED FOR MULTITUDE

GIVE YOUR SERVANT THEREFORE AN UNDERSTANDING MIND TO GOVERN YOUR PEOPLE THAT I MAY DISCERN BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL FOR WHO IS ABLE TO GOVERN THIS YOUR GREAT PEOPLE

 IT PLEASED THE LORD THAT SOLOMON HAD ASKED THIS

AND GOD SAID TO HIM BECAUSE YOU HAVE ASKED THIS AND HAVE NOT ASKED FOR YOURSELF LONG LIFE OR RICHES OR THE LIFE OF YOUR ENEMIES BUT HAVE ASKED FOR YOURSELF UNDERSTANDING TO DISCERN WHAT IS RIGHT BEHOLD I NOW DO ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD

BEHOLD I GIVE YOU A WISE AND DISCERNING MIND SO THAT NONE LIKE YOU HAS BEEN BEFORE YOU AND NONE LIKE YOU SHALL ARISE AFTER YOU

I GIVE YOU ALSO WHAT YOU HAVE NOT ASKED BOTH RICHES AND HONOR SO THAT NO OTHER KING SHALL COMPARE WITH YOU ALL YOUR DAYS

AND IF YOU WILL WALK IN MY WAYS KEEPING MY STATUTES AND MY COMMANDMENTS AS YOUR FATHER DAVID WALKED THEN I WILL LENGTHEN YOUR DAYS

 AND SOLOMON AWOKE AND BEHOLD IT WAS A DREAM

THEN HE CAME TO JERUSALEM AND STOOD BEFORE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD AND OFFERED UP BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS AND MADE A FEAST FOR ALL HIS SERVANTS

THEN TWO PROSTITUTES CAME TO THE KING AND STOOD BEFORE HIM

THE ONE WOMAN SAID OH MY LORD THIS WOMAN AND I LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE AND I GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE

THEN ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER I GAVE BIRTH THIS WOMAN ALSO GAVE BIRTH

AND WE WERE ALONE

THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WITH US IN THE HOUSE; ONLY WE TWO WERE IN THE HOUSE

AND THIS WOMAN'S SON DIED IN THE NIGHT BECAUSE SHE LAY ON HIM

AND SHE AROSE AT MIDNIGHT AND TOOK MY SON FROM BESIDE ME WHILE YOUR SERVANT SLEPT AND LAID HIM AT HER BREAST AND LAID HER DEAD SON AT MY BREAST

WHEN I ROSE IN THE MORNING TO NURSE MY CHILD BEHOLD HE WAS DEAD

BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY IN THE MORNING BEHOLD HE WAS NOT THE CHILD THAT I HAD BORNE

 BUT THE OTHER WOMAN SAID NO THE LIVING CHILD IS MINE AND THE DEAD CHILD IS YOURS

 THE FIRST SAID NO THE DEAD CHILD IS YOURS AND THE LIVING CHILD IS MINE

 THUS THEY SPOKE BEFORE THE KING

THEN THE KING SAID THE ONE SAYS 'THIS IS MY SON THAT IS ALIVE AND YOUR SON IS DEAD'; AND THE OTHER SAYS 'NO; BUT YOUR SON IS DEAD AND MY SON IS THE LIVING ONE

' AND THE KING SAID BRING ME A SWORD

 SO A SWORD WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING

AND THE KING SAID DIVIDE THE LIVING CHILD IN TWO AND GIVE HALF TO THE ONE AND HALF TO THE OTHER

 THEN THE WOMAN WHOSE SON WAS ALIVE SAID TO THE KING BECAUSE HER HEART YEARNED FOR HER SON OH MY LORD GIVE HER THE LIVING CHILD AND BY NO MEANS PUT HIM TO DEATH

 BUT THE OTHER SAID HE SHALL BE NEITHER MINE NOR YOURS; DIVIDE HIM

 THEN THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID GIVE THE LIVING CHILD TO THE FIRST WOMAN AND BY NO MEANS PUT HIM TO DEATH; SHE IS HIS MOTHER

 AND ALL ISRAEL HEARD OF THE JUDGMENT THAT THE KING HAD RENDERED AND THEY STOOD IN AWE OF THE KING BECAUSE THEY PERCEIVED THAT THE WISDOM OF GOD WAS IN HIM TO DO JUSTICE

KING SOLOMON WAS KING OVER ALL ISRAEL AND THESE WERE HIS HIGH OFFICIALS AZARIAH THE SON OF ZADOK WAS THE PRIEST; ELIHOREPH AND AHIJAH THE SONS OF SHISHA WERE SECRETARIES; JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF AHILUD WAS RECORDER; BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS IN COMMAND OF THE ARMY; ZADOK AND ABIATHAR WERE PRIESTS; AZARIAH THE SON OF NATHAN WAS OVER THE OFFICERS; ZABUD THE SON OF NATHAN WAS PRIEST AND KING'S FRIEND; AHISHAR WAS IN CHARGE OF THE PALACE; AND ADONIRAM THE SON OF ABDA WAS IN CHARGE OF THE FORCED LABOR

SOLOMON HAD TWELVE OFFICERS OVER ALL ISRAEL WHO PROVIDED FOOD FOR THE KING AND HIS HOUSEHOLD

EACH MAN HAD TO MAKE PROVISION FOR ONE MONTH IN THE YEAR

THESE WERE THEIR NAMES BENHUR IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM; BENDEKER IN MAKAZ SHAALBIM BETHSHEMESH AND ELONBETHHANAN; BENHESED IN ARUBBOTH TO HIM BELONGED SOCOH AND ALL THE LAND OF HEPHER; BENABINADAB IN ALL NAPHATHDOR HE HAD TAPHATH THE DAUGHTER OF SOLOMON AS HIS WIFE; BAANA THE SON OF AHILUD IN TAANACH MEGIDDO AND ALL BETHSHEAN THAT IS BESIDE ZARETHAN BELOW JEZREEL AND FROM BETHSHEAN TO ABELMEHOLAH AS FAR AS THE OTHER SIDE OF JOKMEAM; BENGEBER IN RAMOTHGILEAD HE HAD THE VILLAGES OF JAIR THE SON OF MANASSEH WHICH ARE IN GILEAD AND HE HAD THE REGION OF ARGOB WHICH IS IN BASHAN SIXTY GREAT CITIES WITH WALLS AND BRONZE BARS; AHINADAB THE SON OF IDDO IN MAHANAIM; AHIMAAZ IN NAPHTALI HE HAD TAKEN BASEMATH THE DAUGHTER OF SOLOMON AS HIS WIFE; BAANA THE SON OF HUSHAI IN ASHER AND BEALOTH; JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF PARUAH IN ISSACHAR; SHIMEI THE SON OF ELA IN BENJAMIN; GEBER THE SON OF URI IN THE LAND OF GILEAD THE COUNTRY OF SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES AND OF OG KING OF BASHAN

AND THERE WAS ONE GOVERNOR WHO WAS OVER THE LAND

JUDAH AND ISRAEL WERE AS MANY AS THE SAND BY THE SEA

THEY ATE AND DRANK AND WERE HAPPY

SOLOMON RULED OVER ALL THE KINGDOMS FROM THE EUPHRATES TO THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND TO THE BORDER OF EGYPT

THEY BROUGHT TRIBUTE AND SERVED SOLOMON ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE

SOLOMON'S PROVISION FOR ONE DAY WAS THIRTY CORS OF FINE FLOUR AND SIXTY CORS OF MEAL TEN FAT OXEN AND TWENTY PASTUREFED CATTLE A HUNDRED SHEEP BESIDES DEER GAZELLES ROEBUCKS AND FATTENED FOWL

FOR HE HAD DOMINION OVER ALL THE REGION WEST OF THE EUPHRATES FROM TIPHSAH TO GAZA OVER ALL THE KINGS WEST OF THE EUPHRATES

AND HE HAD PEACE ON ALL SIDES AROUND HIM

AND JUDAH AND ISRAEL LIVED IN SAFETY FROM DAN EVEN TO BEERSHEBA EVERY MAN UNDER HIS VINE AND UNDER HIS FIG TREE ALL THE DAYS OF SOLOMON

SOLOMON ALSO HAD  STALLS OF HORSES FOR HIS CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN

AND THOSE OFFICERS SUPPLIED PROVISIONS FOR KING SOLOMON AND FOR ALL WHO CAME TO KING SOLOMON'S TABLE EACH ONE IN HIS MONTH

THEY LET NOTHING BE LACKING

BARLEY ALSO AND STRAW FOR THE HORSES AND SWIFT STEEDS THEY BROUGHT TO THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS REQUIRED EACH ACCORDING TO HIS DUTY

AND GOD GAVE SOLOMON WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING BEYOND MEASURE AND BREADTH OF MIND LIKE THE SAND ON THE SEASHORE SO THAT SOLOMON'S WISDOM SURPASSED THE WISDOM OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST AND ALL THE WISDOM OF EGYPT

FOR HE WAS WISER THAN ALL OTHER MEN WISER THAN ETHAN THE EZRAHITE AND HEMAN CALCOL AND DARDA THE SONS OF MAHOL AND HIS FAME WAS IN ALL THE SURROUNDING NATIONS

HE ALSO SPOKE  PROVERBS AND HIS SONGS WERE 

HE SPOKE OF TREES FROM THE CEDAR THAT IS IN LEBANON TO THE HYSSOP THAT GROWS OUT OF THE WALL

HE SPOKE ALSO OF BEASTS AND OF BIRDS AND OF REPTILES AND OF FISH

AND PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS CAME TO HEAR THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON AND FROM ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS WISDOM

NOW HIRAM KING OF TYRE SENT HIS SERVANTS TO SOLOMON WHEN HE HEARD THAT THEY HAD ANOINTED HIM KING IN PLACE OF HIS FATHER FOR HIRAM ALWAYS LOVED DAVID

AND SOLOMON SENT WORD TO HIRAM YOU KNOW THAT DAVID MY FATHER COULD NOT BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD HIS GOD BECAUSE OF THE WARFARE WITH WHICH HIS ENEMIES SURROUNDED HIM UNTIL THE LORD PUT THEM UNDER THE SOLES OF HIS FEET

BUT NOW THE LORD MY GOD HAS GIVEN ME REST ON EVERY SIDE

THERE IS NEITHER ADVERSARY NOR MISFORTUNE

AND SO I INTEND TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD MY GOD AS THE LORD SAID TO DAVID MY FATHER 'YOUR SON WHOM I WILL SET ON YOUR THRONE IN YOUR PLACE SHALL BUILD THE HOUSE FOR MY NAME

' NOW THEREFORE COMMAND THAT CEDARS OF LEBANON BE CUT FOR ME

AND MY SERVANTS WILL JOIN YOUR SERVANTS AND I WILL PAY YOU FOR YOUR SERVANTS SUCH WAGES AS YOU SET FOR YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ONE AMONG US WHO KNOWS HOW TO CUT TIMBER LIKE THE SIDONIANS

 AS SOON AS HIRAM HEARD THE WORDS OF SOLOMON HE REJOICED GREATLY AND SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD THIS DAY WHO HAS GIVEN TO DAVID A WISE SON TO BE OVER THIS GREAT PEOPLE

 AND HIRAM SENT TO SOLOMON SAYING I HAVE HEARD THE MESSAGE THAT YOU HAVE SENT TO ME

I AM READY TO DO ALL YOU DESIRE IN THE MATTER OF CEDAR AND CYPRESS TIMBER

MY SERVANTS SHALL BRING IT DOWN TO THE SEA FROM LEBANON AND I WILL MAKE IT INTO RAFTS TO GO BY SEA TO THE PLACE YOU DIRECT

AND I WILL HAVE THEM BROKEN UP THERE AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE IT

AND YOU SHALL MEET MY WISHES BY PROVIDING FOOD FOR MY HOUSEHOLD

 SO HIRAM SUPPLIED SOLOMON WITH ALL THE TIMBER OF CEDAR AND CYPRESS THAT HE DESIRED WHILE SOLOMON GAVE HIRAM  CORS OF WHEAT AS FOOD FOR HIS HOUSEHOLD AND  CORS OF BEATEN OIL

SOLOMON GAVE THIS TO HIRAM YEAR BY YEAR

AND THE LORD GAVE SOLOMON WISDOM AS HE PROMISED HIM

AND THERE WAS PEACE BETWEEN HIRAM AND SOLOMON AND THE TWO OF THEM MADE A TREATY

KING SOLOMON DRAFTED FORCED LABOR OUT OF ALL ISRAEL AND THE DRAFT NUMBERED  MEN

AND HE SENT THEM TO LEBANON  A MONTH IN SHIFTS

THEY WOULD BE A MONTH IN LEBANON AND TWO MONTHS AT HOME

ADONIRAM WAS IN CHARGE OF THE DRAFT

SOLOMON ALSO HAD  BURDENBEARERS AND  STONECUTTERS IN THE HILL COUNTRY BESIDES SOLOMON'S  CHIEF OFFICERS WHO WERE OVER THE WORK WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED ON THE WORK

AT THE KING'S COMMAND THEY QUARRIED OUT GREAT COSTLY STONES IN ORDER TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE WITH DRESSED STONES

SO SOLOMON'S BUILDERS AND HIRAM'S BUILDERS AND THE MEN OF GEBAL DID THE CUTTING AND PREPARED THE TIMBER AND THE STONE TO BUILD THE HOUSE

IN THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTIETH YEAR AFTER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF SOLOMON'S REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN THE MONTH OF ZIV WHICH IS THE SECOND MONTH HE BEGAN TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THE HOUSE THAT KING SOLOMON BUILT FOR THE LORD WAS SIXTY CUBITS LONG TWENTY CUBITS WIDE AND THIRTY CUBITS HIGH

THE VESTIBULE IN FRONT OF THE NAVE OF THE HOUSE WAS TWENTY CUBITS LONG EQUAL TO THE WIDTH OF THE HOUSE AND TEN CUBITS DEEP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

AND HE MADE FOR THE HOUSE WINDOWS WITH RECESSED FRAMES

HE ALSO BUILT A STRUCTURE AGAINST THE WALL OF THE HOUSE RUNNING AROUND THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE BOTH THE NAVE AND THE INNER SANCTUARY

AND HE MADE SIDE CHAMBERS ALL AROUND

THE LOWEST STORY WAS FIVE CUBITS BROAD THE MIDDLE ONE WAS SIX CUBITS BROAD AND THE THIRD WAS SEVEN CUBITS BROAD

FOR AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE HE MADE OFFSETS ON THE WALL IN ORDER THAT THE SUPPORTING BEAMS SHOULD NOT BE INSERTED INTO THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE

WHEN THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IT WAS WITH STONE PREPARED AT THE QUARRY SO THAT NEITHER HAMMER NOR AXE NOR ANY TOOL OF IRON WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE WHILE IT WAS BEING BUILT

THE ENTRANCE FOR THE LOWEST STORY WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND ONE WENT UP BY STAIRS TO THE MIDDLE STORY AND FROM THE MIDDLE STORY TO THE THIRD

SO HE BUILT THE HOUSE AND FINISHED IT AND HE MADE THE CEILING OF THE HOUSE OF BEAMS AND PLANKS OF CEDAR

HE BUILT THE STRUCTURE AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE FIVE CUBITS HIGH AND IT WAS JOINED TO THE HOUSE WITH TIMBERS OF CEDAR

NOW THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO SOLOMON CONCERNING THIS HOUSE THAT YOU ARE BUILDING IF YOU WILL WALK IN MY STATUTES AND OBEY MY RULES AND KEEP ALL MY COMMANDMENTS AND WALK IN THEM THEN I WILL ESTABLISH MY WORD WITH YOU WHICH I SPOKE TO DAVID YOUR FATHER

AND I WILL DWELL AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND WILL NOT FORSAKE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

 SO SOLOMON BUILT THE HOUSE AND FINISHED IT

HE LINED THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE ON THE INSIDE WITH BOARDS OF CEDAR

FROM THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CEILING HE COVERED THEM ON THE INSIDE WITH WOOD AND HE COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE WITH BOARDS OF CYPRESS

FIVE CUBITS WAS THE LENGTH OF ONE WING OF THE CHERUB AND FIVE CUBITS THE LENGTH OF THE OTHER WING OF THE CHERUB; IT WAS TEN CUBITS FROM THE TIP OF ONE WING TO THE TIP OF THE OTHER

THE OTHER CHERUB ALSO MEASURED TEN CUBITS; BOTH CHERUBIM HAD THE SAME MEASURE AND THE SAME FORM

THE HEIGHT OF ONE CHERUB WAS TEN CUBITS AND SO WAS THAT OF THE OTHER CHERUB

HE PUT THE CHERUBIM IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE HOUSE

AND THE WINGS OF THE CHERUBIM WERE SPREAD OUT SO THAT A WING OF ONE TOUCHED THE ONE WALL AND A WING OF THE OTHER CHERUB TOUCHED THE OTHER WALL; THEIR OTHER WINGS TOUCHED EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE

AND HE OVERLAID THE CHERUBIM WITH GOLD

AROUND ALL THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE HE CARVED ENGRAVED FIGURES OF CHERUBIM AND PALM TREES AND OPEN FLOWERS IN THE INNER AND OUTER ROOMS

THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE HE OVERLAID WITH GOLD IN THE INNER AND OUTER ROOMS

ON THEM HE CARVED CHERUBIM AND PALM TREES AND OPEN FLOWERS AND HE OVERLAID THEM WITH GOLD EVENLY APPLIED ON THE CARVED WORK

HE BUILT THE INNER COURT WITH THREE COURSES OF CUT STONE AND ONE COURSE OF CEDAR BEAMS

IN THE FOURTH YEAR THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS LAID IN THE MONTH OF ZIV

AND IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR IN THE MONTH OF BUL WHICH IS THE EIGHTH MONTH THE HOUSE WAS FINISHED IN ALL ITS PARTS AND ACCORDING TO ALL ITS SPECIFICATIONS

HE WAS SEVEN YEARS IN BUILDING IT

SOLOMON ALSO MADE A HOUSE LIKE THIS HALL FOR PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER WHOM HE HAD TAKEN IN MARRIAGE

ALL THESE WERE MADE OF COSTLY STONES CUT ACCORDING TO MEASURE SAWED WITH SAWS BACK AND FRONT EVEN FROM THE FOUNDATION TO THE COPING AND FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE GREAT COURT

THE FOUNDATION WAS OF COSTLY STONES HUGE STONES STONES OF EIGHT AND TEN CUBITS

AND ABOVE WERE COSTLY STONES CUT ACCORDING TO MEASUREMENT AND CEDAR

THE GREAT COURT HAD THREE COURSES OF CUT STONE ALL AROUND AND A COURSE OF CEDAR BEAMS; SO HAD THE INNER COURT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE VESTIBULE OF THE HOUSE

AND KING SOLOMON SENT AND BROUGHT HIRAM FROM TYRE

HE WAS THE SON OF A WIDOW OF THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI AND HIS FATHER WAS A MAN OF TYRE A WORKER IN BRONZE

AND HE WAS FULL OF WISDOM UNDERSTANDING AND SKILL FOR MAKING ANY WORK IN BRONZE

THE CAPITALS WERE ON THE TWO PILLARS AND ALSO ABOVE THE ROUNDED PROJECTION WHICH WAS BESIDE THE LATTICEWORK

THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED POMEGRANATES IN TWO ROWS ALL AROUND AND SO WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL

IN THE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN THE KING CAST THEM IN THE CLAY GROUND BETWEEN SUCCOTH AND ZARETHAN

AND SOLOMON LEFT ALL THE VESSELS UNWEIGHED BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM; THE WEIGHT OF THE BRONZE WAS NOT ASCERTAINED

SO SOLOMON MADE ALL THE VESSELS THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GOLDEN ALTAR THE GOLDEN TABLE FOR THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE THE LAMPSTANDS OF PURE GOLD FIVE ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND FIVE ON THE NORTH BEFORE THE INNER SANCTUARY; THE FLOWERS THE LAMPS AND THE TONGS OF GOLD; THE CUPS SNUFFERS BASINS DISHES FOR INCENSE AND FIRE PANS OF PURE GOLD; AND THE SOCKETS OF GOLD FOR THE DOORS OF THE INNERMOST PART OF THE HOUSE THE MOST HOLY PLACE AND FOR THE DOORS OF THE NAVE OF THE TEMPLE

THEN SOLOMON ASSEMBLED THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND ALL THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES THE LEADERS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BEFORE KING SOLOMON IN JERUSALEM TO BRING UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD OUT OF THE CITY OF DAVID WHICH IS ZION

AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL ASSEMBLED TO KING SOLOMON AT THE FEAST IN THE MONTH ETHANIM WHICH IS THE SEVENTH MONTH

AND ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME AND THE PRIESTS TOOK UP THE ARK

AND THEY BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF THE LORD THE TENT OF MEETING AND ALL THE HOLY VESSELS THAT WERE IN THE TENT; THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES BROUGHT THEM UP

AND KING SOLOMON AND ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL WHO HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE HIM WERE WITH HIM BEFORE THE ARK SACRIFICING SO MANY SHEEP AND OXEN THAT THEY COULD NOT BE COUNTED OR NUMBERED

THEN THE PRIESTS BROUGHT THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TO ITS PLACE IN THE INNER SANCTUARY OF THE HOUSE IN THE MOST HOLY PLACE UNDERNEATH THE WINGS OF THE CHERUBIM

FOR THE CHERUBIM SPREAD OUT THEIR WINGS OVER THE PLACE OF THE ARK SO THAT THE CHERUBIM OVERSHADOWED THE ARK AND ITS POLES

AND THE POLES WERE SO LONG THAT THE ENDS OF THE POLES WERE SEEN FROM THE HOLY PLACE BEFORE THE INNER SANCTUARY; BUT THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE

AND THEY ARE THERE TO THIS DAY

THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ARK EXCEPT THE TWO TABLETS OF STONE THAT MOSES PUT THERE AT HOREB WHERE THE LORD MADE A COVENANT WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND WHEN THE PRIESTS CAME OUT OF THE HOLY PLACE A CLOUD FILLED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THAT THE PRIESTS COULD NOT STAND TO MINISTER BECAUSE OF THE CLOUD FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THEN SOLOMON SAID THE LORD HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD DWELL IN THICK DARKNESS

I HAVE INDEED BUILT YOU AN EXALTED HOUSE A PLACE FOR YOU TO DWELL IN FOREVER

 THEN THE KING TURNED AROUND AND BLESSED ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL WHILE ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL STOOD

AND HE SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO WITH HIS HAND HAS FULFILLED WHAT HE PROMISED WITH HIS MOUTH TO DAVID MY FATHER SAYING 'SINCE THE DAY THAT I BROUGHT MY PEOPLE ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT I CHOSE NO CITY OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN WHICH TO BUILD A HOUSE THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE THERE

BUT I CHOSE DAVID TO BE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' NOW IT WAS IN THE HEART OF DAVID MY FATHER TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

BUT THE LORD SAID TO DAVID MY FATHER 'WHEREAS IT WAS IN YOUR HEART TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME YOU DID WELL THAT IT WAS IN YOUR HEART

NEVERTHELESS YOU SHALL NOT BUILD THE HOUSE BUT YOUR SON WHO SHALL BE BORN TO YOU SHALL BUILD THE HOUSE FOR MY NAME

' NOW THE LORD HAS FULFILLED HIS PROMISE THAT HE MADE

FOR I HAVE RISEN IN THE PLACE OF DAVID MY FATHER AND SIT ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL AS THE LORD PROMISED AND I HAVE BUILT THE HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

AND THERE I HAVE PROVIDED A PLACE FOR THE ARK IN WHICH IS THE COVENANT OF THE LORD THAT HE MADE WITH OUR FATHERS WHEN HE BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

 THEN SOLOMON STOOD BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE LORD IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS TOWARD HEAVEN AND SAID O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL THERE IS NO GOD LIKE YOU IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR ON EARTH BENEATH KEEPING COVENANT AND SHOWING STEADFAST LOVE TO YOUR SERVANTS WHO WALK BEFORE YOU WITH ALL THEIR HEART WHO HAVE KEPT WITH YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER WHAT YOU DECLARED TO HIM

YOU SPOKE WITH YOUR MOUTH AND WITH YOUR HAND HAVE FULFILLED IT THIS DAY

NOW THEREFORE O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL KEEP FOR YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED HIM SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT LACK A MAN TO SIT BEFORE ME ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL IF ONLY YOUR SONS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THEIR WAY TO WALK BEFORE ME AS YOU HAVE WALKED BEFORE ME

' NOW THEREFORE O GOD OF ISRAEL LET YOUR WORD BE CONFIRMED WHICH YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER

BUT WILL GOD INDEED DWELL ON THE EARTH

BEHOLD HEAVEN AND THE HIGHEST HEAVEN CANNOT CONTAIN YOU; HOW MUCH LESS THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT

YET HAVE REGARD TO THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANT AND TO HIS PLEA O LORD MY GOD LISTENING TO THE CRY AND TO THE PRAYER THAT YOUR SERVANT PRAYS BEFORE YOU THIS DAY THAT YOUR EYES MAY BE OPEN NIGHT AND DAY TOWARD THIS HOUSE THE PLACE OF WHICH YOU HAVE SAID 'MY NAME SHALL BE THERE' THAT YOU MAY LISTEN TO THE PRAYER THAT YOUR SERVANT OFFERS TOWARD THIS PLACE

AND LISTEN TO THE PLEA OF YOUR SERVANT AND OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL WHEN THEY PRAY TOWARD THIS PLACE

AND LISTEN IN HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND WHEN YOU HEAR FORGIVE

IF A MAN SINS AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR AND IS MADE TO TAKE AN OATH AND COMES AND SWEARS HIS OATH BEFORE YOUR ALTAR IN THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN AND ACT AND JUDGE YOUR SERVANTS CONDEMNING THE GUILTY BY BRINGING HIS CONDUCT ON HIS OWN HEAD AND VINDICATING THE RIGHTEOUS BY REWARDING HIM ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS

WHEN YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL ARE DEFEATED BEFORE THE ENEMY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU AND IF THEY TURN AGAIN TO YOU AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NAME AND PRAY AND PLEAD WITH YOU IN THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN AND FORGIVE THE SIN OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND BRING THEM AGAIN TO THE LAND THAT YOU GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS

WHEN HEAVEN IS SHUT UP AND THERE IS NO RAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU IF THEY PRAY TOWARD THIS PLACE AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NAME AND TURN FROM THEIR SIN WHEN YOU AFFLICT THEM THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN AND FORGIVE THE SIN OF YOUR SERVANTS YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL WHEN YOU TEACH THEM THE GOOD WAY IN WHICH THEY SHOULD WALK AND GRANT RAIN UPON YOUR LAND WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN TO YOUR PEOPLE AS AN INHERITANCE

IF THERE IS FAMINE IN THE LAND IF THERE IS PESTILENCE OR BLIGHT OR MILDEW OR LOCUST OR CATERPILLAR IF THEIR ENEMY BESIEGES THEM IN THE LAND AT THEIR GATES WHATEVER PLAGUE WHATEVER SICKNESS THERE IS WHATEVER PRAYER WHATEVER PLEA IS MADE BY ANY MAN OR BY ALL YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL EACH KNOWING THE AFFLICTION OF HIS OWN HEART AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TOWARD THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND FORGIVE AND ACT AND RENDER TO EACH WHOSE HEART YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WAYS FOR YOU YOU ONLY KNOW THE HEARTS OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND THAT THEY MAY FEAR YOU ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY LIVE IN THE LAND THAT YOU GAVE TO OUR FATHERS

LIKEWISE WHEN A FOREIGNER WHO IS NOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL COMES FROM A FAR COUNTRY FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE FOR THEY SHALL HEAR OF YOUR GREAT NAME AND YOUR MIGHTY HAND AND OF YOUR OUTSTRETCHED ARM WHEN HE COMES AND PRAYS TOWARD THIS HOUSE HEAR IN HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND DO ACCORDING TO ALL FOR WHICH THE FOREIGNER CALLS TO YOU IN ORDER THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW YOUR NAME AND FEAR YOU AS DO YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT IS CALLED BY YOUR NAME

IF YOUR PEOPLE GO OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THEIR ENEMY BY WHATEVER WAY YOU SHALL SEND THEM AND THEY PRAY TO THE LORD TOWARD THE CITY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT FOR YOUR NAME THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN THEIR PRAYER AND THEIR PLEA AND MAINTAIN THEIR CAUSE

IF THEY SIN AGAINST YOUFOR THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES NOT SINAND YOU ARE ANGRY WITH THEM AND GIVE THEM TO AN ENEMY SO THAT THEY ARE CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE TO THE LAND OF THE ENEMY FAR OFF OR NEAR YET IF THEY TURN THEIR HEART IN THE LAND TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED CAPTIVE AND REPENT AND PLEAD WITH YOU IN THE LAND OF THEIR CAPTORS SAYING 'WE HAVE SINNED AND HAVE ACTED PERVERSELY AND WICKEDLY' IF THEY REPENT WITH ALL THEIR MIND AND WITH ALL THEIR HEART IN THE LAND OF THEIR ENEMIES WHO CARRIED THEM CAPTIVE AND PRAY TO YOU TOWARD THEIR LAND WHICH YOU GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS THE CITY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT FOR YOUR NAME THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE THEIR PRAYER AND THEIR PLEA AND MAINTAIN THEIR CAUSE AND FORGIVE YOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU AND ALL THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST YOU AND GRANT THEM COMPASSION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE WHO CARRIED THEM CAPTIVE THAT THEY MAY HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM FOR THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE WHICH YOU BROUGHT OUT OF EGYPT FROM THE MIDST OF THE IRON FURNACE

LET YOUR EYES BE OPEN TO THE PLEA OF YOUR SERVANT AND TO THE PLEA OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL GIVING EAR TO THEM WHENEVER THEY CALL TO YOU

FOR YOU SEPARATED THEM FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH TO BE YOUR HERITAGE AS YOU DECLARED THROUGH MOSES YOUR SERVANT WHEN YOU BROUGHT OUR FATHERS OUT OF EGYPT O LORD GOD

 NOW AS SOLOMON FINISHED OFFERING ALL THIS PRAYER AND PLEA TO THE LORD HE AROSE FROM BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE LORD WHERE HE HAD KNELT WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD HEAVEN

AND HE STOOD AND BLESSED ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL WITH A LOUD VOICE SAYING BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN REST TO HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HE PROMISED

NOT ONE WORD HAS FAILED OF ALL HIS GOOD PROMISE WHICH HE SPOKE BY MOSES HIS SERVANT

THE LORD OUR GOD BE WITH US AS HE WAS WITH OUR FATHERS

MAY HE NOT LEAVE US OR FORSAKE US THAT HE MAY INCLINE OUR HEARTS TO HIM TO WALK IN ALL HIS WAYS AND TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS HIS STATUTES AND HIS RULES WHICH HE COMMANDED OUR FATHERS

LET THESE WORDS OF MINE WITH WHICH I HAVE PLEADED BEFORE THE LORD BE NEAR TO THE LORD OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT AND MAY HE MAINTAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS SERVANT AND THE CAUSE OF HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL AS EACH DAY REQUIRES THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD IS GOD; THERE IS NO OTHER

LET YOUR HEART THEREFORE BE WHOLLY TRUE TO THE LORD OUR GOD WALKING IN HIS STATUTES AND KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS AS AT THIS DAY

 THEN THE KING AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM OFFERED SACRIFICE BEFORE THE LORD

SOLOMON OFFERED AS PEACE OFFERINGS TO THE LORD  OXEN AND  SHEEP

SO THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEDICATED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THE SAME DAY THE KING CONSECRATED THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT THAT WAS BEFORE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOR THERE HE OFFERED THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE GRAIN OFFERING AND THE FAT PIECES OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS BECAUSE THE BRONZE ALTAR THAT WAS BEFORE THE LORD WAS TOO SMALL TO RECEIVE THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE GRAIN OFFERING AND THE FAT PIECES OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS

SO SOLOMON HELD THE FEAST AT THAT TIME AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM A GREAT ASSEMBLY FROM LEBOHAMATH TO THE BROOK OF EGYPT BEFORE THE LORD OUR GOD SEVEN DAYS

ON THE EIGHTH DAY HE SENT THE PEOPLE AWAY AND THEY BLESSED THE KING AND WENT TO THEIR HOMES JOYFUL AND GLAD OF HEART FOR ALL THE GOODNESS THAT THE LORD HAD SHOWN TO DAVID HIS SERVANT AND TO ISRAEL HIS PEOPLE

AS SOON AS SOLOMON HAD FINISHED BUILDING THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE AND ALL THAT SOLOMON DESIRED TO BUILD THE LORD APPEARED TO SOLOMON A SECOND TIME AS HE HAD APPEARED TO HIM AT GIBEON

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM I HAVE HEARD YOUR PRAYER AND YOUR PLEA WHICH YOU HAVE MADE BEFORE ME

I HAVE CONSECRATED THIS HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE BUILT BY PUTTING MY NAME THERE FOREVER

MY EYES AND MY HEART WILL BE THERE FOR ALL TIME

AND AS FOR YOU IF YOU WILL WALK BEFORE ME AS DAVID YOUR FATHER WALKED WITH INTEGRITY OF HEART AND UPRIGHTNESS DOING ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU AND KEEPING MY STATUTES AND MY RULES THEN I WILL ESTABLISH YOUR ROYAL THRONE OVER ISRAEL FOREVER AS I PROMISED DAVID YOUR FATHER SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT LACK A MAN ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL

' BUT IF YOU TURN ASIDE FROM FOLLOWING ME YOU OR YOUR CHILDREN AND DO NOT KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND MY STATUTES THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU BUT GO AND SERVE OTHER GODS AND WORSHIP THEM THEN I WILL CUT OFF ISRAEL FROM THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE CONSECRATED FOR MY NAME I WILL CAST OUT OF MY SIGHT AND ISRAEL WILL BECOME A PROVERB AND A BYWORD AMONG ALL PEOPLES

AND THIS HOUSE WILL BECOME A HEAP OF RUINS

EVERYONE PASSING BY IT WILL BE ASTONISHED AND WILL HISS AND THEY WILL SAY 'WHY HAS THE LORD DONE THUS TO THIS LAND AND TO THIS HOUSE

' THEN THEY WILL SAY 'BECAUSE THEY ABANDONED THE LORD THEIR GOD WHO BROUGHT THEIR FATHERS OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND LAID HOLD ON OTHER GODS AND WORSHIPED THEM AND SERVED THEM

THEREFORE THE LORD HAS BROUGHT ALL THIS DISASTER ON THEM

' AT THE END OF TWENTY YEARS IN WHICH SOLOMON HAD BUILT THE TWO HOUSES THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE AND HIRAM KING OF TYRE HAD SUPPLIED SOLOMON WITH CEDAR AND CYPRESS TIMBER AND GOLD AS MUCH AS HE DESIRED KING SOLOMON GAVE TO HIRAM TWENTY CITIES IN THE LAND OF GALILEE

BUT WHEN HIRAM CAME FROM TYRE TO SEE THE CITIES THAT SOLOMON HAD GIVEN HIM THEY DID NOT PLEASE HIM

THEREFORE HE SAID WHAT KIND OF CITIES ARE THESE THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME MY BROTHER

 SO THEY ARE CALLED THE LAND OF CABUL TO THIS DAY

HIRAM HAD SENT TO THE KING  TALENTS OF GOLD

AND THIS IS THE ACCOUNT OF THE FORCED LABOR THAT KING SOLOMON DRAFTED TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND HIS OWN HOUSE AND THE MILLO AND THE WALL OF JERUSALEM AND HAZOR AND MEGIDDO AND GEZER PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT HAD GONE UP AND CAPTURED GEZER AND BURNED IT WITH FIRE AND HAD KILLED THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN THE CITY AND HAD GIVEN IT AS DOWRY TO HIS DAUGHTER SOLOMON'S WIFE; SO SOLOMON REBUILT GEZER AND LOWER BETHHORON AND BAALATH AND TAMAR IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND ALL THE STORE CITIES THAT SOLOMON HAD AND THE CITIES FOR HIS CHARIOTS AND THE CITIES FOR HIS HORSEMEN AND WHATEVER SOLOMON DESIRED TO BUILD IN JERUSALEM IN LEBANON AND IN ALL THE LAND OF HIS DOMINION

ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT OF THE AMORITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES WHO WERE NOT OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEIR DESCENDANTS WHO WERE LEFT AFTER THEM IN THE LAND WHOM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE UNABLE TO DEVOTE TO DESTRUCTIONTHESE SOLOMON DRAFTED TO BE SLAVES AND SO THEY ARE TO THIS DAY

BUT OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SOLOMON MADE NO SLAVES

THEY WERE THE SOLDIERS THEY WERE HIS OFFICIALS HIS COMMANDERS HIS CAPTAINS HIS CHARIOT COMMANDERS AND HIS HORSEMEN

THESE WERE THE CHIEF OFFICERS WHO WERE OVER SOLOMON'S WORK  WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CARRIED ON THE WORK

BUT PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER WENT UP FROM THE CITY OF DAVID TO HER OWN HOUSE THAT SOLOMON HAD BUILT FOR HER

THEN HE BUILT THE MILLO

THREE TIMES A YEAR SOLOMON USED TO OFFER UP BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS ON THE ALTAR THAT HE BUILT TO THE LORD MAKING OFFERINGS WITH IT BEFORE THE LORD

SO HE FINISHED THE HOUSE

KING SOLOMON BUILT A FLEET OF SHIPS AT EZIONGEBER WHICH IS NEAR ELOTH ON THE SHORE OF THE RED SEA IN THE LAND OF EDOM

AND HIRAM SENT WITH THE FLEET HIS SERVANTS SEAMEN WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE SEA TOGETHER WITH THE SERVANTS OF SOLOMON

AND THEY WENT TO OPHIR AND BROUGHT FROM THERE GOLD  TALENTS AND THEY BROUGHT IT TO KING SOLOMON

NOW WHEN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HEARD OF THE FAME OF SOLOMON CONCERNING THE NAME OF THE LORD SHE CAME TO TEST HIM WITH HARD QUESTIONS

SHE CAME TO JERUSALEM WITH A VERY GREAT RETINUE WITH CAMELS BEARING SPICES AND VERY MUCH GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES

AND WHEN SHE CAME TO SOLOMON SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT WAS ON HER MIND

AND SOLOMON ANSWERED ALL HER QUESTIONS; THERE WAS NOTHING HIDDEN FROM THE KING THAT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO HER

AND WHEN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HAD SEEN ALL THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD BUILT THE FOOD OF HIS TABLE THE SEATING OF HIS OFFICIALS AND THE ATTENDANCE OF HIS SERVANTS THEIR CLOTHING HIS CUPBEARERS AND HIS BURNT OFFERINGS THAT HE OFFERED AT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THERE WAS NO MORE BREATH IN HER

AND SHE SAID TO THE KING THE REPORT WAS TRUE THAT I HEARD IN MY OWN LAND OF YOUR WORDS AND OF YOUR WISDOM BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE THE REPORTS UNTIL I CAME AND MY OWN EYES HAD SEEN IT

AND BEHOLD THE HALF WAS NOT TOLD ME

YOUR WISDOM AND PROSPERITY SURPASS THE REPORT THAT I HEARD

HAPPY ARE YOUR MEN

HAPPY ARE YOUR SERVANTS WHO CONTINUALLY STAND BEFORE YOU AND HEAR YOUR WISDOM

BLESSED BE THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS DELIGHTED IN YOU AND SET YOU ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL

BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED ISRAEL FOREVER HE HAS MADE YOU KING THAT YOU MAY EXECUTE JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS

 THEN SHE GAVE THE KING  TALENTS OF GOLD AND A VERY GREAT QUANTITY OF SPICES AND PRECIOUS STONES

NEVER AGAIN CAME SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF SPICES AS THESE THAT THE QUEEN OF SHEBA GAVE TO KING SOLOMON

MOREOVER THE FLEET OF HIRAM WHICH BROUGHT GOLD FROM OPHIR BROUGHT FROM OPHIR A VERY GREAT AMOUNT OF ALMUG WOOD AND PRECIOUS STONES

AND THE KING MADE OF THE ALMUG WOOD SUPPORTS FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND FOR THE KING'S HOUSE ALSO LYRES AND HARPS FOR THE SINGERS

NO SUCH ALMUG WOOD HAS COME OR BEEN SEEN TO THIS DAY

AND KING SOLOMON GAVE TO THE QUEEN OF SHEBA ALL THAT SHE DESIRED WHATEVER SHE ASKED BESIDES WHAT WAS GIVEN HER BY THE BOUNTY OF KING SOLOMON

SO SHE TURNED AND WENT BACK TO HER OWN LAND WITH HER SERVANTS

NOW THE WEIGHT OF GOLD THAT CAME TO SOLOMON IN ONE YEAR WAS  TALENTS OF GOLD BESIDES THAT WHICH CAME FROM THE EXPLORERS AND FROM THE BUSINESS OF THE MERCHANTS AND FROM ALL THE KINGS OF THE WEST AND FROM THE GOVERNORS OF THE LAND

KING SOLOMON MADE  LARGE SHIELDS OF BEATEN GOLD;  SHEKELS OF GOLD WENT INTO EACH SHIELD

AND HE MADE  SHIELDS OF BEATEN GOLD; THREE MINAS OF GOLD WENT INTO EACH SHIELD

AND THE KING PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON

THE KING ALSO MADE A GREAT IVORY THRONE AND OVERLAID IT WITH THE FINEST GOLD

THE THRONE HAD SIX STEPS AND AT THE BACK OF THE THRONE WAS A CALF'S HEAD AND ON EACH SIDE OF THE SEAT WERE ARMRESTS AND TWO LIONS STANDING BESIDE THE ARMRESTS WHILE TWELVE LIONS STOOD THERE ONE ON EACH END OF A STEP ON THE SIX STEPS

THE LIKE OF IT WAS NEVER MADE IN ANY KINGDOM

ALL KING SOLOMON'S DRINKING VESSELS WERE OF GOLD AND ALL THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON WERE OF PURE GOLD

NONE WERE OF SILVER; SILVER WAS NOT CONSIDERED AS ANYTHING IN THE DAYS OF SOLOMON

FOR THE KING HAD A FLEET OF SHIPS OF TARSHISH AT SEA WITH THE FLEET OF HIRAM

ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS THE FLEET OF SHIPS OF TARSHISH USED TO COME BRINGING GOLD SILVER IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS

THUS KING SOLOMON EXCELLED ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH IN RICHES AND IN WISDOM

AND THE WHOLE EARTH SOUGHT THE PRESENCE OF SOLOMON TO HEAR HIS WISDOM WHICH GOD HAD PUT INTO HIS MIND

EVERY ONE OF THEM BROUGHT HIS PRESENT ARTICLES OF SILVER AND GOLD GARMENTS MYRRH SPICES HORSES AND MULES SO MUCH YEAR BY YEAR

AND SOLOMON GATHERED TOGETHER CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN

HE HAD  CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN WHOM HE STATIONED IN THE CHARIOT CITIES AND WITH THE KING IN JERUSALEM

AND THE KING MADE SILVER AS COMMON IN JERUSALEM AS STONE AND HE MADE CEDAR AS PLENTIFUL AS THE SYCAMORE OF THE SHEPHELAH

AND SOLOMON'S IMPORT OF HORSES WAS FROM EGYPT AND KUE AND THE KING'S TRADERS RECEIVED THEM FROM KUE AT A PRICE

A CHARIOT COULD BE IMPORTED FROM EGYPT FOR  SHEKELS OF SILVER AND A HORSE FOR  AND SO THROUGH THE KING'S TRADERS THEY WERE EXPORTED TO ALL THE KINGS OF THE HITTITES AND THE KINGS OF SYRIA

NOW KING SOLOMON LOVED MANY FOREIGN WOMEN ALONG WITH THE DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH MOABITE AMMONITE EDOMITE SIDONIAN AND HITTITE WOMEN FROM THE NATIONS CONCERNING WHICH THE LORD HAD SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL YOU SHALL NOT ENTER INTO MARRIAGE WITH THEM NEITHER SHALL THEY WITH YOU FOR SURELY THEY WILL TURN AWAY YOUR HEART AFTER THEIR GODS

 SOLOMON CLUNG TO THESE IN LOVE

HE HAD  WIVES PRINCESSES AND  CONCUBINES

AND HIS WIVES TURNED AWAY HIS HEART

FOR WHEN SOLOMON WAS OLD HIS WIVES TURNED AWAY HIS HEART AFTER OTHER GODS AND HIS HEART WAS NOT WHOLLY TRUE TO THE LORD HIS GOD AS WAS THE HEART OF DAVID HIS FATHER

FOR SOLOMON WENT AFTER ASHTORETH THE GODDESS OF THE SIDONIANS AND AFTER MILCOM THE ABOMINATION OF THE AMMONITES

SO SOLOMON DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND DID NOT WHOLLY FOLLOW THE LORD AS DAVID HIS FATHER HAD DONE

THEN SOLOMON BUILT A HIGH PLACE FOR CHEMOSH THE ABOMINATION OF MOAB AND FOR MOLECH THE ABOMINATION OF THE AMMONITES ON THE MOUNTAIN EAST OF JERUSALEM

AND SO HE DID FOR ALL HIS FOREIGN WIVES WHO MADE OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICED TO THEIR GODS

AND THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH SOLOMON BECAUSE HIS HEART HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO HAD APPEARED TO HIM TWICE AND HAD COMMANDED HIM CONCERNING THIS THING THAT HE SHOULD NOT GO AFTER OTHER GODS

BUT HE DID NOT KEEP WHAT THE LORD COMMANDED

THEREFORE THE LORD SAID TO SOLOMON SINCE THIS HAS BEEN YOUR PRACTICE AND YOU HAVE NOT KEPT MY COVENANT AND MY STATUTES THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU I WILL SURELY TEAR THE KINGDOM FROM YOU AND WILL GIVE IT TO YOUR SERVANT

YET FOR THE SAKE OF DAVID YOUR FATHER I WILL NOT DO IT IN YOUR DAYS BUT I WILL TEAR IT OUT OF THE HAND OF YOUR SON

HOWEVER I WILL NOT TEAR AWAY ALL THE KINGDOM BUT I WILL GIVE ONE TRIBE TO YOUR SON FOR THE SAKE OF DAVID MY SERVANT AND FOR THE SAKE OF JERUSALEM THAT I HAVE CHOSEN

 AND THE LORD RAISED UP AN ADVERSARY AGAINST SOLOMON HADAD THE EDOMITE

HE WAS OF THE ROYAL HOUSE IN EDOM

FOR WHEN DAVID WAS IN EDOM AND JOAB THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WENT UP TO BURY THE SLAIN HE STRUCK DOWN EVERY MALE IN EDOM FOR JOAB AND ALL ISRAEL REMAINED THERE SIX MONTHS UNTIL HE HAD CUT OFF EVERY MALE IN EDOM

BUT HADAD FLED TO EGYPT TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN EDOMITES OF HIS FATHER'S SERVANTS HADAD STILL BEING A LITTLE CHILD

THEY SET OUT FROM MIDIAN AND CAME TO PARAN AND TOOK MEN WITH THEM FROM PARAN AND CAME TO EGYPT TO PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT WHO GAVE HIM A HOUSE AND ASSIGNED HIM AN ALLOWANCE OF FOOD AND GAVE HIM LAND

AND HADAD FOUND GREAT FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF PHARAOH SO THAT HE GAVE HIM IN MARRIAGE THE SISTER OF HIS OWN WIFE THE SISTER OF TAHPENES THE QUEEN

AND THE SISTER OF TAHPENES BORE HIM GENUBATH HIS SON WHOM TAHPENES WEANED IN PHARAOH'S HOUSE

AND GENUBATH WAS IN PHARAOH'S HOUSE AMONG THE SONS OF PHARAOH

BUT WHEN HADAD HEARD IN EGYPT THAT DAVID SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THAT JOAB THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WAS DEAD HADAD SAID TO PHARAOH LET ME DEPART THAT I MAY GO TO MY OWN COUNTRY

 BUT PHARAOH SAID TO HIM WHAT HAVE YOU LACKED WITH ME THAT YOU ARE NOW SEEKING TO GO TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY

 AND HE SAID TO HIM ONLY LET ME DEPART

 GOD ALSO RAISED UP AS AN ADVERSARY TO HIM REZON THE SON OF ELIADA WHO HAD FLED FROM HIS MASTER HADADEZER KING OF ZOBAH

AND HE GATHERED MEN ABOUT HIM AND BECAME LEADER OF A MARAUDING BAND AFTER THE KILLING BY DAVID

AND THEY WENT TO DAMASCUS AND LIVED THERE AND MADE HIM KING IN DAMASCUS

HE WAS AN ADVERSARY OF ISRAEL ALL THE DAYS OF SOLOMON DOING HARM AS HADAD DID

AND HE LOATHED ISRAEL AND REIGNED OVER SYRIA

JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT AN EPHRAIMITE OF ZEREDAH A SERVANT OF SOLOMON WHOSE MOTHER'S NAME WAS ZERUAH A WIDOW ALSO LIFTED UP HIS HAND AGAINST THE KING

AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE LIFTED UP HIS HAND AGAINST THE KING

SOLOMON BUILT THE MILLO AND CLOSED UP THE BREACH OF THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER

THE MAN JEROBOAM WAS VERY ABLE AND WHEN SOLOMON SAW THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS INDUSTRIOUS HE GAVE HIM CHARGE OVER ALL THE FORCED LABOR OF THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH

AND AT THAT TIME WHEN JEROBOAM WENT OUT OF JERUSALEM THE PROPHET AHIJAH THE SHILONITE FOUND HIM ON THE ROAD

NOW AHIJAH HAD DRESSED HIMSELF IN A NEW GARMENT AND THE TWO OF THEM WERE ALONE IN THE OPEN COUNTRY

THEN AHIJAH LAID HOLD OF THE NEW GARMENT THAT WAS ON HIM AND TORE IT INTO TWELVE PIECES

AND HE SAID TO JEROBOAM TAKE FOR YOURSELF TEN PIECES FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO TEAR THE KINGDOM FROM THE HAND OF SOLOMON AND WILL GIVE YOU TEN TRIBES BUT HE SHALL HAVE ONE TRIBE FOR THE SAKE OF MY SERVANT DAVID AND FOR THE SAKE OF JERUSALEM THE CITY THAT I HAVE CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND WORSHIPED ASHTORETH THE GODDESS OF THE SIDONIANS CHEMOSH THE GOD OF MOAB AND MILCOM THE GOD OF THE AMMONITES AND THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN MY WAYS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT IN MY SIGHT AND KEEPING MY STATUTES AND MY RULES AS DAVID HIS FATHER DID

NEVERTHELESS I WILL NOT TAKE THE WHOLE KINGDOM OUT OF HIS HAND BUT I WILL MAKE HIM RULER ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF DAVID MY SERVANT WHOM I CHOSE WHO KEPT MY COMMANDMENTS AND MY STATUTES

BUT I WILL TAKE THE KINGDOM OUT OF HIS SON'S HAND AND WILL GIVE IT TO YOU TEN TRIBES

YET TO HIS SON I WILL GIVE ONE TRIBE THAT DAVID MY SERVANT MAY ALWAYS HAVE A LAMP BEFORE ME IN JERUSALEM THE CITY WHERE I HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT MY NAME

AND I WILL TAKE YOU AND YOU SHALL REIGN OVER ALL THAT YOUR SOUL DESIRES AND YOU SHALL BE KING OVER ISRAEL

AND IF YOU WILL LISTEN TO ALL THAT I COMMAND YOU AND WILL WALK IN MY WAYS AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT IN MY EYES BY KEEPING MY STATUTES AND MY COMMANDMENTS AS DAVID MY SERVANT DID I WILL BE WITH YOU AND WILL BUILD YOU A SURE HOUSE AS I BUILT FOR DAVID AND I WILL GIVE ISRAEL TO YOU

AND I WILL AFFLICT THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID BECAUSE OF THIS BUT NOT FOREVER

' SOLOMON SOUGHT THEREFORE TO KILL JEROBOAM

BUT JEROBOAM AROSE AND FLED INTO EGYPT TO SHISHAK KING OF EGYPT AND WAS IN EGYPT UNTIL THE DEATH OF SOLOMON

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF SOLOMON AND ALL THAT HE DID AND HIS WISDOM ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE ACTS OF SOLOMON

AND THE TIME THAT SOLOMON REIGNED IN JERUSALEM OVER ALL ISRAEL WAS FORTY YEARS

AND SOLOMON SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER

AND REHOBOAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

REHOBOAM WENT TO SHECHEM FOR ALL ISRAEL HAD COME TO SHECHEM TO MAKE HIM KING

AND AS SOON AS JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT HEARD OF IT FOR HE WAS STILL IN EGYPT WHERE HE HAD FLED FROM KING SOLOMON THEN JEROBOAM RETURNED FROM EGYPT

AND THEY SENT AND CALLED HIM AND JEROBOAM AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL CAME AND SAID TO REHOBOAM YOUR FATHER MADE OUR YOKE HEAVY

NOW THEREFORE LIGHTEN THE HARD SERVICE OF YOUR FATHER AND HIS HEAVY YOKE ON US AND WE WILL SERVE YOU

 HE SAID TO THEM GO AWAY FOR THREE DAYS THEN COME AGAIN TO ME

 SO THE PEOPLE WENT AWAY

THEN KING REHOBOAM TOOK COUNSEL WITH THE OLD MEN WHO HAD STOOD BEFORE SOLOMON HIS FATHER WHILE HE WAS YET ALIVE SAYING HOW DO YOU ADVISE ME TO ANSWER THIS PEOPLE

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM IF YOU WILL BE A SERVANT TO THIS PEOPLE TODAY AND SERVE THEM AND SPEAK GOOD WORDS TO THEM WHEN YOU ANSWER THEM THEN THEY WILL BE YOUR SERVANTS FOREVER

 BUT HE ABANDONED THE COUNSEL THAT THE OLD MEN GAVE HIM AND TOOK COUNSEL WITH THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM AND STOOD BEFORE HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT DO YOU ADVISE THAT WE ANSWER THIS PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID TO ME 'LIGHTEN THE YOKE THAT YOUR FATHER PUT ON US'

 AND THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM SAID TO HIM THUS SHALL YOU SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE WHO SAID TO YOU 'YOUR FATHER MADE OUR YOKE HEAVY BUT YOU LIGHTEN IT FOR US' THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THEM 'MY LITTLE FINGER IS THICKER THAN MY FATHER'S THIGHS

AND NOW WHEREAS MY FATHER LAID ON YOU A HEAVY YOKE I WILL ADD TO YOUR YOKE

MY FATHER DISCIPLINED YOU WITH WHIPS BUT I WILL DISCIPLINE YOU WITH SCORPIONS

' SO JEROBOAM AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO REHOBOAM THE THIRD DAY AS THE KING SAID COME TO ME AGAIN THE THIRD DAY

 AND THE KING ANSWERED THE PEOPLE HARSHLY AND FORSAKING THE COUNSEL THAT THE OLD MEN HAD GIVEN HIM HE SPOKE TO THEM ACCORDING TO THE COUNSEL OF THE YOUNG MEN SAYING MY FATHER MADE YOUR YOKE HEAVY BUT I WILL ADD TO YOUR YOKE

MY FATHER DISCIPLINED YOU WITH WHIPS BUT I WILL DISCIPLINE YOU WITH SCORPIONS

 SO THE KING DID NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE FOR IT WAS A TURN OF AFFAIRS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE LORD THAT HE MIGHT FULFILL HIS WORD WHICH THE LORD SPOKE BY AHIJAH THE SHILONITE TO JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT

AND WHEN ALL ISRAEL SAW THAT THE KING DID NOT LISTEN TO THEM THE PEOPLE ANSWERED THE KING WHAT PORTION DO WE HAVE IN DAVID

WE HAVE NO INHERITANCE IN THE SON OF JESSE

TO YOUR TENTS O ISRAEL

LOOK NOW TO YOUR OWN HOUSE DAVID

 SO ISRAEL WENT TO THEIR TENTS

BUT REHOBOAM REIGNED OVER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH

THEN KING REHOBOAM SENT ADORAM WHO WAS TASKMASTER OVER THE FORCED LABOR AND ALL ISRAEL STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES

AND KING REHOBOAM HURRIED TO MOUNT HIS CHARIOT TO FLEE TO JERUSALEM

SO ISRAEL HAS BEEN IN REBELLION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF DAVID TO THIS DAY

AND WHEN ALL ISRAEL HEARD THAT JEROBOAM HAD RETURNED THEY SENT AND CALLED HIM TO THE ASSEMBLY AND MADE HIM KING OVER ALL ISRAEL

THERE WAS NONE THAT FOLLOWED THE HOUSE OF DAVID BUT THE TRIBE OF JUDAH ONLY

WHEN REHOBOAM CAME TO JERUSALEM HE ASSEMBLED ALL THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN  CHOSEN WARRIORS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON

BUT THE WORD OF GOD CAME TO SHEMAIAH THE MAN OF GOD SAY TO REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON KING OF JUDAH AND TO ALL THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN AND TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE 'THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU SHALL NOT GO UP OR FIGHT AGAINST YOUR RELATIVES THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

EVERY MAN RETURN TO HIS HOME FOR THIS THING IS FROM ME

' SO THEY LISTENED TO THE WORD OF THE LORD AND WENT HOME AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

THEN JEROBOAM BUILT SHECHEM IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND LIVED THERE

AND HE WENT OUT FROM THERE AND BUILT PENUEL

AND JEROBOAM SAID IN HIS HEART NOW THE KINGDOM WILL TURN BACK TO THE HOUSE OF DAVID

IF THIS PEOPLE GO UP TO OFFER SACRIFICES IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AT JERUSALEM THEN THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE WILL TURN AGAIN TO THEIR LORD TO REHOBOAM KING OF JUDAH AND THEY WILL KILL ME AND RETURN TO REHOBOAM KING OF JUDAH

 SO THE KING TOOK COUNSEL AND MADE TWO CALVES OF GOLD

AND HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE GONE UP TO JERUSALEM LONG ENOUGH

BEHOLD YOUR GODS O ISRAEL WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

 AND HE SET ONE IN BETHEL AND THE OTHER HE PUT IN DAN

THEN THIS THING BECAME A SIN FOR THE PEOPLE WENT AS FAR AS DAN TO BE BEFORE ONE

HE ALSO MADE TEMPLES ON HIGH PLACES AND APPOINTED PRIESTS FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OF THE LEVITES

AND JEROBOAM APPOINTED A FEAST ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE EIGHTH MONTH LIKE THE FEAST THAT WAS IN JUDAH AND HE OFFERED SACRIFICES ON THE ALTAR

SO HE DID IN BETHEL SACRIFICING TO THE CALVES THAT HE MADE

AND HE PLACED IN BETHEL THE PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES THAT HE HAD MADE

HE WENT UP TO THE ALTAR THAT HE HAD MADE IN BETHEL ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY IN THE EIGHTH MONTH IN THE MONTH THAT HE HAD DEVISED FROM HIS OWN HEART

AND HE INSTITUTED A FEAST FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND WENT UP TO THE ALTAR TO MAKE OFFERINGS

AND BEHOLD A MAN OF GOD CAME OUT OF JUDAH BY THE WORD OF THE LORD TO BETHEL

JEROBOAM WAS STANDING BY THE ALTAR TO MAKE OFFERINGS

AND THE MAN CRIED AGAINST THE ALTAR BY THE WORD OF THE LORD AND SAID O ALTAR ALTAR THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BEHOLD A SON SHALL BE BORN TO THE HOUSE OF DAVID JOSIAH BY NAME AND HE SHALL SACRIFICE ON YOU THE PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES WHO MAKE OFFERINGS ON YOU AND HUMAN BONES SHALL BE BURNED ON YOU

' AND HE GAVE A SIGN THE SAME DAY SAYING THIS IS THE SIGN THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN 'BEHOLD THE ALTAR SHALL BE TORN DOWN AND THE ASHES THAT ARE ON IT SHALL BE POURED OUT

' AND WHEN THE KING HEARD THE SAYING OF THE MAN OF GOD WHICH HE CRIED AGAINST THE ALTAR AT BETHEL JEROBOAM STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FROM THE ALTAR SAYING SEIZE HIM

 AND HIS HAND WHICH HE STRETCHED OUT AGAINST HIM DRIED UP SO THAT HE COULD NOT DRAW IT BACK TO HIMSELF

THE ALTAR ALSO WAS TORN DOWN AND THE ASHES POURED OUT FROM THE ALTAR ACCORDING TO THE SIGN THAT THE MAN OF GOD HAD GIVEN BY THE WORD OF THE LORD

AND THE KING SAID TO THE MAN OF GOD ENTREAT NOW THE FAVOR OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND PRAY FOR ME THAT MY HAND MAY BE RESTORED TO ME

 AND THE MAN OF GOD ENTREATED THE LORD AND THE KING'S HAND WAS RESTORED TO HIM AND BECAME AS IT WAS BEFORE

AND THE KING SAID TO THE MAN OF GOD COME HOME WITH ME AND REFRESH YOURSELF AND I WILL GIVE YOU A REWARD

 AND THE MAN OF GOD SAID TO THE KING IF YOU GIVE ME HALF YOUR HOUSE I WILL NOT GO IN WITH YOU

AND I WILL NOT EAT BREAD OR DRINK WATER IN THIS PLACE FOR SO WAS IT COMMANDED ME BY THE WORD OF THE LORD SAYING 'YOU SHALL NEITHER EAT BREAD NOR DRINK WATER NOR RETURN BY THE WAY THAT YOU CAME

' SO HE WENT ANOTHER WAY AND DID NOT RETURN BY THE WAY THAT HE CAME TO BETHEL

NOW AN OLD PROPHET LIVED IN BETHEL

AND HIS SONS CAME AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT THE MAN OF GOD HAD DONE THAT DAY IN BETHEL

THEY ALSO TOLD TO THEIR FATHER THE WORDS THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THE KING

AND THEIR FATHER SAID TO THEM WHICH WAY DID HE GO

 AND HIS SONS SHOWED HIM THE WAY THAT THE MAN OF GOD WHO CAME FROM JUDAH HAD GONE

AND HE SAID TO HIS SONS SADDLE THE DONKEY FOR ME

 SO THEY SADDLED THE DONKEY FOR HIM AND HE MOUNTED IT

AND HE WENT AFTER THE MAN OF GOD AND FOUND HIM SITTING UNDER AN OAK

AND HE SAID TO HIM ARE YOU THE MAN OF GOD WHO CAME FROM JUDAH

 AND HE SAID I AM

 THEN HE SAID TO HIM COME HOME WITH ME AND EAT BREAD

 AND HE SAID I MAY NOT RETURN WITH YOU OR GO IN WITH YOU NEITHER WILL I EAT BREAD NOR DRINK WATER WITH YOU IN THIS PLACE FOR IT WAS SAID TO ME BY THE WORD OF THE LORD 'YOU SHALL NEITHER EAT BREAD NOR DRINK WATER THERE NOR RETURN BY THE WAY THAT YOU CAME

' AND HE SAID TO HIM I ALSO AM A PROPHET AS YOU ARE AND AN ANGEL SPOKE TO ME BY THE WORD OF THE LORD SAYING 'BRING HIM BACK WITH YOU INTO YOUR HOUSE THAT HE MAY EAT BREAD AND DRINK WATER

' BUT HE LIED TO HIM

SO HE WENT BACK WITH HIM AND ATE BREAD IN HIS HOUSE AND DRANK WATER

AND AS THEY SAT AT THE TABLE THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO THE PROPHET WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK

AND HE CRIED TO THE MAN OF GOD WHO CAME FROM JUDAH THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BECAUSE YOU HAVE DISOBEYED THE WORD OF THE LORD AND HAVE NOT KEPT THE COMMAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD COMMANDED YOU BUT HAVE COME BACK AND HAVE EATEN BREAD AND DRUNK WATER IN THE PLACE OF WHICH HE SAID TO YOU EAT NO BREAD AND DRINK NO WATER YOUR BODY SHALL NOT COME TO THE TOMB OF YOUR FATHERS

' AND AFTER HE HAD EATEN BREAD AND DRUNK HE SADDLED THE DONKEY FOR THE PROPHET WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT BACK

AND AS HE WENT AWAY A LION MET HIM ON THE ROAD AND KILLED HIM

AND HIS BODY WAS THROWN IN THE ROAD AND THE DONKEY STOOD BESIDE IT; THE LION ALSO STOOD BESIDE THE BODY

AND BEHOLD MEN PASSED BY AND SAW THE BODY THROWN IN THE ROAD AND THE LION STANDING BY THE BODY

AND THEY CAME AND TOLD IT IN THE CITY WHERE THE OLD PROPHET LIVED

AND WHEN THE PROPHET WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM THE WAY HEARD OF IT HE SAID IT IS THE MAN OF GOD WHO DISOBEYED THE WORD OF THE LORD; THEREFORE THE LORD HAS GIVEN HIM TO THE LION WHICH HAS TORN HIM AND KILLED HIM ACCORDING TO THE WORD THAT THE LORD SPOKE TO HIM

 AND HE SAID TO HIS SONS SADDLE THE DONKEY FOR ME

 AND THEY SADDLED IT

AND HE WENT AND FOUND HIS BODY THROWN IN THE ROAD AND THE DONKEY AND THE LION STANDING BESIDE THE BODY

THE LION HAD NOT EATEN THE BODY OR TORN THE DONKEY

AND THE PROPHET TOOK UP THE BODY OF THE MAN OF GOD AND LAID IT ON THE DONKEY AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE CITY TO MOURN AND TO BURY HIM

AND HE LAID THE BODY IN HIS OWN GRAVE

AND THEY MOURNED OVER HIM SAYING ALAS MY BROTHER

 AND AFTER HE HAD BURIED HIM HE SAID TO HIS SONS WHEN I DIE BURY ME IN THE GRAVE IN WHICH THE MAN OF GOD IS BURIED; LAY MY BONES BESIDE HIS BONES

FOR THE SAYING THAT HE CALLED OUT BY THE WORD OF THE LORD AGAINST THE ALTAR IN BETHEL AND AGAINST ALL THE HOUSES OF THE HIGH PLACES THAT ARE IN THE CITIES OF SAMARIA SHALL SURELY COME TO PASS

 AFTER THIS THING JEROBOAM DID NOT TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY BUT MADE PRIESTS FOR THE HIGH PLACES AGAIN FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE

ANY WHO WOULD HE ORDAINED TO BE PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES

AND THIS THING BECAME SIN TO THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM SO AS TO CUT IT OFF AND TO DESTROY IT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH

AT THAT TIME ABIJAH THE SON OF JEROBOAM FELL SICK

AND JEROBOAM SAID TO HIS WIFE ARISE AND DISGUISE YOURSELF THAT IT NOT BE KNOWN THAT YOU ARE THE WIFE OF JEROBOAM AND GO TO SHILOH

BEHOLD AHIJAH THE PROPHET IS THERE WHO SAID OF ME THAT I SHOULD BE KING OVER THIS PEOPLE

TAKE WITH YOU TEN LOAVES SOME CAKES AND A JAR OF HONEY AND GO TO HIM

HE WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHALL HAPPEN TO THE CHILD

 JEROBOAM'S WIFE DID SO

SHE AROSE AND WENT TO SHILOH AND CAME TO THE HOUSE OF AHIJAH

NOW AHIJAH COULD NOT SEE FOR HIS EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF HIS AGE

AND THE LORD SAID TO AHIJAH BEHOLD THE WIFE OF JEROBOAM IS COMING TO INQUIRE OF YOU CONCERNING HER SON FOR HE IS SICK

THUS AND THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO HER

WHEN SHE CAME SHE PRETENDED TO BE ANOTHER WOMAN

BUT WHEN AHIJAH HEARD THE SOUND OF HER FEET AS SHE CAME IN AT THE DOOR HE SAID COME IN WIFE OF JEROBOAM

WHY DO YOU PRETEND TO BE ANOTHER

FOR I AM CHARGED WITH UNBEARABLE NEWS FOR YOU

GO TELL JEROBOAM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BECAUSE I EXALTED YOU FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE AND MADE YOU LEADER OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND TORE THE KINGDOM AWAY FROM THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND GAVE IT TO YOU AND YET YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LIKE MY SERVANT DAVID WHO KEPT MY COMMANDMENTS AND FOLLOWED ME WITH ALL HIS HEART DOING ONLY THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT IN MY EYES BUT YOU HAVE DONE EVIL ABOVE ALL WHO WERE BEFORE YOU AND HAVE GONE AND MADE FOR YOURSELF OTHER GODS AND METAL IMAGES PROVOKING ME TO ANGER AND HAVE CAST ME BEHIND YOUR BACK THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL BRING HARM UPON THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM AND WILL CUT OFF FROM JEROBOAM EVERY MALE BOTH BOND AND FREE IN ISRAEL AND WILL BURN UP THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM AS A MAN BURNS UP DUNG UNTIL IT IS ALL GONE

ANYONE BELONGING TO JEROBOAM WHO DIES IN THE CITY THE DOGS SHALL EAT AND ANYONE WHO DIES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS SHALL EAT FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN IT

' ARISE THEREFORE GO TO YOUR HOUSE

WHEN YOUR FEET ENTER THE CITY THE CHILD SHALL DIE

AND ALL ISRAEL SHALL MOURN FOR HIM AND BURY HIM FOR HE ONLY OF JEROBOAM SHALL COME TO THE GRAVE BECAUSE IN HIM THERE IS FOUND SOMETHING PLEASING TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL IN THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM

MOREOVER THE LORD WILL RAISE UP FOR HIMSELF A KING OVER ISRAEL WHO SHALL CUT OFF THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM TODAY

AND HENCEFORTH THE LORD WILL STRIKE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER AND ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND THAT HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE EUPHRATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE THEIR ASHERIM PROVOKING THE LORD TO ANGER

AND HE WILL GIVE ISRAEL UP BECAUSE OF THE SINS OF JEROBOAM WHICH HE SINNED AND MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

 THEN JEROBOAM'S WIFE AROSE AND DEPARTED AND CAME TO TIRZAH

AND AS SHE CAME TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE HOUSE THE CHILD DIED

AND ALL ISRAEL BURIED HIM AND MOURNED FOR HIM ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE BY HIS SERVANT AHIJAH THE PROPHET

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEROBOAM HOW HE WARRED AND HOW HE REIGNED BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND THE TIME THAT JEROBOAM REIGNED WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS

AND HE SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND NADAB HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

NOW REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON REIGNED IN JUDAH

REHOBOAM WAS FORTYONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM THE CITY THAT THE LORD HAD CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO PUT HIS NAME THERE

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS NAAMAH THE AMMONITE

AND JUDAH DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND THEY PROVOKED HIM TO JEALOUSY WITH THEIR SINS THAT THEY COMMITTED MORE THAN ALL THAT THEIR FATHERS HAD DONE

FOR THEY ALSO BUILT FOR THEMSELVES HIGH PLACES AND PILLARS AND ASHERIM ON EVERY HIGH HILL AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE AND THERE WERE ALSO MALE CULT PROSTITUTES IN THE LAND

THEY DID ACCORDING TO ALL THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE NATIONS THAT THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF KING REHOBOAM SHISHAK KING OF EGYPT CAME UP AGAINST JERUSALEM

HE TOOK AWAY THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE

HE TOOK AWAY EVERYTHING

HE ALSO TOOK AWAY ALL THE SHIELDS OF GOLD THAT SOLOMON HAD MADE AND KING REHOBOAM MADE IN THEIR PLACE SHIELDS OF BRONZE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS OF THE GUARD WHO KEPT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S HOUSE

AND AS OFTEN AS THE KING WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GUARD CARRIED THEM AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE GUARDROOM

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF REHOBOAM AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN REHOBOAM AND JEROBOAM CONTINUALLY

AND REHOBOAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS NAAMAH THE AMMONITE

AND ABIJAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

NOW IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF KING JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT ABIJAM BEGAN TO REIGN OVER JUDAH

HE REIGNED FOR THREE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS MAACAH THE DAUGHTER OF ABISHALOM

AND HE WALKED IN ALL THE SINS THAT HIS FATHER DID BEFORE HIM AND HIS HEART WAS NOT WHOLLY TRUE TO THE LORD HIS GOD AS THE HEART OF DAVID HIS FATHER

NEVERTHELESS FOR DAVID'S SAKE THE LORD HIS GOD GAVE HIM A LAMP IN JERUSALEM SETTING UP HIS SON AFTER HIM AND ESTABLISHING JERUSALEM BECAUSE DAVID DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND DID NOT TURN ASIDE FROM ANYTHING THAT HE COMMANDED HIM ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE EXCEPT IN THE MATTER OF URIAH THE HITTITE

NOW THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN REHOBOAM AND JEROBOAM ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE

THE REST OF THE ACTS OF ABIJAM AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN ABIJAM AND JEROBOAM

HE PUT AWAY THE MALE CULT PROSTITUTES OUT OF THE LAND AND REMOVED ALL THE IDOLS THAT HIS FATHERS HAD MADE

HE ALSO REMOVED MAACAH HIS MOTHER FROM BEING QUEEN MOTHER BECAUSE SHE HAD MADE AN ABOMINABLE IMAGE FOR ASHERAH

AND ASA CUT DOWN HER IMAGE AND BURNED IT AT THE BROOK KIDRON

BUT THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY

NEVERTHELESS THE HEART OF ASA WAS WHOLLY TRUE TO THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS

AND HE BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE SACRED GIFTS OF HIS FATHER AND HIS OWN SACRED GIFTS SILVER AND GOLD AND VESSELS

AND THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN ASA AND BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL ALL THEIR DAYS

BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL WENT UP AGAINST JUDAH AND BUILT RAMAH THAT HE MIGHT PERMIT NO ONE TO GO OUT OR COME IN TO ASA KING OF JUDAH

THEN ASA TOOK ALL THE SILVER AND THE GOLD THAT WERE LEFT IN THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND GAVE THEM INTO THE HANDS OF HIS SERVANTS

AND KING ASA SENT THEM TO BENHADAD THE SON OF TABRIMMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA WHO LIVED IN DAMASCUS SAYING LET THERE BE A COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU AS THERE WAS BETWEEN MY FATHER AND YOUR FATHER

BEHOLD I AM SENDING TO YOU A PRESENT OF SILVER AND GOLD

GO BREAK YOUR COVENANT WITH BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL THAT HE MAY WITHDRAW FROM ME

 AND BENHADAD LISTENED TO KING ASA AND SENT THE COMMANDERS OF HIS ARMIES AGAINST THE CITIES OF ISRAEL AND CONQUERED IJON DAN ABELBETHMAACAH AND ALL CHINNEROTH WITH ALL THE LAND OF NAPHTALI

AND WHEN BAASHA HEARD OF IT HE STOPPED BUILDING RAMAH AND HE LIVED IN TIRZAH

THEN KING ASA MADE A PROCLAMATION TO ALL JUDAH NONE WAS EXEMPT AND THEY CARRIED AWAY THE STONES OF RAMAH AND ITS TIMBER WITH WHICH BAASHA HAD BEEN BUILDING AND WITH THEM KING ASA BUILT GEBA OF BENJAMIN AND MIZPAH

NOW THE REST OF ALL THE ACTS OF ASA ALL HIS MIGHT AND ALL THAT HE DID AND THE CITIES THAT HE BUILT ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

BUT IN HIS OLD AGE HE WAS DISEASED IN HIS FEET

AND ASA SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND JEHOSHAPHAT HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN THE SECOND YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH AND HE REIGNED OVER ISRAEL TWO YEARS

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND WALKED IN THE WAY OF HIS FATHER AND IN HIS SIN WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

BAASHA THE SON OF AHIJAH OF THE HOUSE OF ISSACHAR CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM

AND BAASHA STRUCK HIM DOWN AT GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES FOR NADAB AND ALL ISRAEL WERE LAYING SIEGE TO GIBBETHON

SO BAASHA KILLED HIM IN THE THIRD YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH AND REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AND AS SOON AS HE WAS KING HE KILLED ALL THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM

HE LEFT TO THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM NOT ONE THAT BREATHED UNTIL HE HAD DESTROYED IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE BY HIS SERVANT AHIJAH THE SHILONITE

IT WAS FOR THE SINS OF JEROBOAM THAT HE SINNED AND THAT HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN AND BECAUSE OF THE ANGER TO WHICH HE PROVOKED THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF NADAB AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN ASA AND BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL ALL THEIR DAYS

IN THE THIRD YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH BAASHA THE SON OF AHIJAH BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ALL ISRAEL AT TIRZAH AND HE REIGNED TWENTYFOUR YEARS

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND WALKED IN THE WAY OF JEROBOAM AND IN HIS SIN WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEHU THE SON OF HANANI AGAINST BAASHA SAYING SINCE I EXALTED YOU OUT OF THE DUST AND MADE YOU LEADER OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND YOU HAVE WALKED IN THE WAY OF JEROBOAM AND HAVE MADE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL TO SIN PROVOKING ME TO ANGER WITH THEIR SINS BEHOLD I WILL UTTERLY SWEEP AWAY BAASHA AND HIS HOUSE AND I WILL MAKE YOUR HOUSE LIKE THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT

ANYONE BELONGING TO BAASHA WHO DIES IN THE CITY THE DOGS SHALL EAT AND ANYONE OF HIS WHO DIES IN THE FIELD THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS SHALL EAT

 NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF BAASHA AND WHAT HE DID AND HIS MIGHT ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND BAASHA SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED AT TIRZAH AND ELAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

MOREOVER THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME BY THE PROPHET JEHU THE SON OF HANANI AGAINST BAASHA AND HIS HOUSE BOTH BECAUSE OF ALL THE EVIL THAT HE DID IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD PROVOKING HIM TO ANGER WITH THE WORK OF HIS HANDS IN BEING LIKE THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM AND ALSO BECAUSE HE DESTROYED IT

IN THE TWENTYSIXTH YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH ELAH THE SON OF BAASHA BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN TIRZAH AND HE REIGNED TWO YEARS

BUT HIS SERVANT ZIMRI COMMANDER OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM

WHEN HE WAS AT TIRZAH DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD IN TIRZAH ZIMRI CAME IN AND STRUCK HIM DOWN AND KILLED HIM IN THE TWENTYSEVENTH YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH AND REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AS SOON AS HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS THRONE HE STRUCK DOWN ALL THE HOUSE OF BAASHA

HE DID NOT LEAVE HIM A SINGLE MALE OF HIS RELATIVES OR HIS FRIENDS

THUS ZIMRI DESTROYED ALL THE HOUSE OF BAASHA ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE AGAINST BAASHA BY JEHU THE PROPHET FOR ALL THE SINS OF BAASHA AND THE SINS OF ELAH HIS SON WHICH THEY SINNED AND WHICH THEY MADE ISRAEL TO SIN PROVOKING THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL TO ANGER WITH THEIR IDOLS

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF ELAH AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

IN THE TWENTYSEVENTH YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH ZIMRI REIGNED SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH

NOW THE TROOPS WERE ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ENCAMPED HEARD IT SAID ZIMRI HAS CONSPIRED AND HE HAS KILLED THE KING

 THEREFORE ALL ISRAEL MADE OMRI THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY KING OVER ISRAEL THAT DAY IN THE CAMP

SO OMRI WENT UP FROM GIBBETHON AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM AND THEY BESIEGED TIRZAH

AND WHEN ZIMRI SAW THAT THE CITY WAS TAKEN HE WENT INTO THE CITADEL OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND BURNED THE KING'S HOUSE OVER HIM WITH FIRE AND DIED BECAUSE OF HIS SINS THAT HE COMMITTED DOING EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD WALKING IN THE WAY OF JEROBOAM AND FOR HIS SIN WHICH HE COMMITTED MAKING ISRAEL TO SIN

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF ZIMRI AND THE CONSPIRACY THAT HE MADE ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS

HALF OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED TIBNI THE SON OF GINATH TO MAKE HIM KING AND HALF FOLLOWED OMRI

BUT THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED OMRI OVERCAME THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED TIBNI THE SON OF GINATH

SO TIBNI DIED AND OMRI BECAME KING

IN THE THIRTYFIRST YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH OMRI BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL AND HE REIGNED FOR TWELVE YEARS; SIX YEARS HE REIGNED IN TIRZAH

HE BOUGHT THE HILL OF SAMARIA FROM SHEMER FOR TWO TALENTS OF SILVER AND HE FORTIFIED THE HILL AND CALLED THE NAME OF THE CITY THAT HE BUILT SAMARIA AFTER THE NAME OF SHEMER THE OWNER OF THE HILL

OMRI DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND DID MORE EVIL THAN ALL WHO WERE BEFORE HIM

FOR HE WALKED IN ALL THE WAY OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT AND IN THE SINS THAT HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN PROVOKING THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO ANGER BY THEIR IDOLS

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF OMRI THAT HE DID AND THE MIGHT THAT HE SHOWED ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND OMRI SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN SAMARIA AND AHAB HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE THIRTYEIGHTH YEAR OF ASA KING OF JUDAH AHAB THE SON OF OMRI BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL AND AHAB THE SON OF OMRI REIGNED OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA TWENTYTWO YEARS

AND AHAB THE SON OF OMRI DID EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD MORE THAN ALL WHO WERE BEFORE HIM

AND AS IF IT HAD BEEN A LIGHT THING FOR HIM TO WALK IN THE SINS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT HE TOOK FOR HIS WIFE JEZEBEL THE DAUGHTER OF ETHBAAL KING OF THE SIDONIANS AND WENT AND SERVED BAAL AND WORSHIPED HIM

HE ERECTED AN ALTAR FOR BAAL IN THE HOUSE OF BAAL WHICH HE BUILT IN SAMARIA

AND AHAB MADE AN ASHERAH

AHAB DID MORE TO PROVOKE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO ANGER THAN ALL THE KINGS OF ISRAEL WHO WERE BEFORE HIM

IN HIS DAYS HIEL OF BETHEL BUILT JERICHO

HE LAID ITS FOUNDATION AT THE COST OF ABIRAM HIS FIRSTBORN AND SET UP ITS GATES AT THE COST OF HIS YOUNGEST SON SEGUB ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE BY JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN

NOW ELIJAH THE TISHBITE OF TISHBE IN GILEAD SAID TO AHAB AS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL LIVES BEFORE WHOM I STAND THERE SHALL BE NEITHER DEW NOR RAIN THESE YEARS EXCEPT BY MY WORD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO HIM DEPART FROM HERE AND TURN EASTWARD AND HIDE YOURSELF BY THE BROOK CHERITH WHICH IS EAST OF THE JORDAN

YOU SHALL DRINK FROM THE BROOK AND I HAVE COMMANDED THE RAVENS TO FEED YOU THERE

 SO HE WENT AND DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

HE WENT AND LIVED BY THE BROOK CHERITH THAT IS EAST OF THE JORDAN

AND THE RAVENS BROUGHT HIM BREAD AND MEAT IN THE MORNING AND BREAD AND MEAT IN THE EVENING AND HE DRANK FROM THE BROOK

AND AFTER A WHILE THE BROOK DRIED UP BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RAIN IN THE LAND

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO HIM ARISE GO TO ZAREPHATH WHICH BELONGS TO SIDON AND DWELL THERE

BEHOLD I HAVE COMMANDED A WIDOW THERE TO FEED YOU

 SO HE AROSE AND WENT TO ZAREPHATH

AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GATE OF THE CITY BEHOLD A WIDOW WAS THERE GATHERING STICKS

AND HE CALLED TO HER AND SAID BRING ME A LITTLE WATER IN A VESSEL THAT I MAY DRINK

 AND AS SHE WAS GOING TO BRING IT HE CALLED TO HER AND SAID BRING ME A MORSEL OF BREAD IN YOUR HAND

 AND SHE SAID AS THE LORD YOUR GOD LIVES I HAVE NOTHING BAKED ONLY A HANDFUL OF FLOUR IN A JAR AND A LITTLE OIL IN A JUG

AND NOW I AM GATHERING A COUPLE OF STICKS THAT I MAY GO IN AND PREPARE IT FOR MYSELF AND MY SON THAT WE MAY EAT IT AND DIE

 AND ELIJAH SAID TO HER DO NOT FEAR; GO AND DO AS YOU HAVE SAID

BUT FIRST MAKE ME A LITTLE CAKE OF IT AND BRING IT TO ME AND AFTERWARD MAKE SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR SON

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'THE JAR OF FLOUR SHALL NOT BE SPENT AND THE JUG OF OIL SHALL NOT BE EMPTY UNTIL THE DAY THAT THE LORD SENDS RAIN UPON THE EARTH

' AND SHE WENT AND DID AS ELIJAH SAID

AND SHE AND HE AND HER HOUSEHOLD ATE FOR MANY DAYS

THE JAR OF FLOUR WAS NOT SPENT NEITHER DID THE JUG OF OIL BECOME EMPTY ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE BY ELIJAH

AFTER THIS THE SON OF THE WOMAN THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE BECAME ILL

AND HIS ILLNESS WAS SO SEVERE THAT THERE WAS NO BREATH LEFT IN HIM

AND SHE SAID TO ELIJAH WHAT HAVE YOU AGAINST ME O MAN OF GOD

YOU HAVE COME TO ME TO BRING MY SIN TO REMEMBRANCE AND TO CAUSE THE DEATH OF MY SON

 AND HE SAID TO HER GIVE ME YOUR SON

 AND HE TOOK HIM FROM HER ARMS AND CARRIED HIM UP INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER WHERE HE LODGED AND LAID HIM ON HIS OWN BED

AND HE CRIED TO THE LORD O LORD MY GOD HAVE YOU BROUGHT CALAMITY EVEN UPON THE WIDOW WITH WHOM I SOJOURN BY KILLING HER SON

 THEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON THE CHILD THREE TIMES AND CRIED TO THE LORD O LORD MY GOD LET THIS CHILD'S LIFE COME INTO HIM AGAIN

 AND THE LORD LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF ELIJAH

AND THE LIFE OF THE CHILD CAME INTO HIM AGAIN AND HE REVIVED

AND ELIJAH TOOK THE CHILD AND BROUGHT HIM DOWN FROM THE UPPER CHAMBER INTO THE HOUSE AND DELIVERED HIM TO HIS MOTHER

AND ELIJAH SAID SEE YOUR SON LIVES

 AND THE WOMAN SAID TO ELIJAH NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF GOD AND THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD IN YOUR MOUTH IS TRUTH

AFTER MANY DAYS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ELIJAH IN THE THIRD YEAR SAYING GO SHOW YOURSELF TO AHAB AND I WILL SEND RAIN UPON THE EARTH

 SO ELIJAH WENT TO SHOW HIMSELF TO AHAB

NOW THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN SAMARIA

AND AHAB CALLED OBADIAH WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD

NOW OBADIAH FEARED THE LORD GREATLY AND WHEN JEZEBEL CUT OFF THE PROPHETS OF THE LORD OBADIAH TOOK A HUNDRED PROPHETS AND HID THEM BY FIFTIES IN A CAVE AND FED THEM WITH BREAD AND WATER

 AND AHAB SAID TO OBADIAH GO THROUGH THE LAND TO ALL THE SPRINGS OF WATER AND TO ALL THE VALLEYS

PERHAPS WE MAY FIND GRASS AND SAVE THE HORSES AND MULES ALIVE AND NOT LOSE SOME OF THE ANIMALS

 SO THEY DIVIDED THE LAND BETWEEN THEM TO PASS THROUGH IT

AHAB WENT IN ONE DIRECTION BY HIMSELF AND OBADIAH WENT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY HIMSELF

AND AS OBADIAH WAS ON THE WAY BEHOLD ELIJAH MET HIM

AND OBADIAH RECOGNIZED HIM AND FELL ON HIS FACE AND SAID IS IT YOU MY LORD ELIJAH

 AND HE ANSWERED HIM IT IS I

GO TELL YOUR LORD 'BEHOLD ELIJAH IS HERE

' AND HE SAID HOW HAVE I SINNED THAT YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR SERVANT INTO THE HAND OF AHAB TO KILL ME

AS THE LORD YOUR GOD LIVES THERE IS NO NATION OR KINGDOM WHERE MY LORD HAS NOT SENT TO SEEK YOU

AND WHEN THEY WOULD SAY 'HE IS NOT HERE' HE WOULD TAKE AN OATH OF THE KINGDOM OR NATION THAT THEY HAD NOT FOUND YOU

AND NOW YOU SAY 'GO TELL YOUR LORD BEHOLD ELIJAH IS HERE

' AND AS SOON AS I HAVE GONE FROM YOU THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WILL CARRY YOU I KNOW NOT WHERE

AND SO WHEN I COME AND TELL AHAB AND HE CANNOT FIND YOU HE WILL KILL ME ALTHOUGH I YOUR SERVANT HAVE FEARED THE LORD FROM MY YOUTH

HAS IT NOT BEEN TOLD MY LORD WHAT I DID WHEN JEZEBEL KILLED THE PROPHETS OF THE LORD HOW I HID A HUNDRED MEN OF THE LORD'S PROPHETS BY FIFTIES IN A CAVE AND FED THEM WITH BREAD AND WATER

AND NOW YOU SAY 'GO TELL YOUR LORD BEHOLD ELIJAH IS HERE'; AND HE WILL KILL ME

 AND ELIJAH SAID AS THE LORD OF HOSTS LIVES BEFORE WHOM I STAND I WILL SURELY SHOW MYSELF TO HIM TODAY

 SO OBADIAH WENT TO MEET AHAB AND TOLD HIM

AND AHAB WENT TO MEET ELIJAH

WHEN AHAB SAW ELIJAH AHAB SAID TO HIM IS IT YOU YOU TROUBLER OF ISRAEL

 AND HE ANSWERED I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ISRAEL BUT YOU HAVE AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABANDONED THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD AND FOLLOWED THE BAALS

NOW THEREFORE SEND AND GATHER ALL ISRAEL TO ME AT MOUNT CARMEL AND THE  PROPHETS OF BAAL AND THE  PROPHETS OF ASHERAH WHO EAT AT JEZEBEL'S TABLE

 SO AHAB SENT TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND GATHERED THE PROPHETS TOGETHER AT MOUNT CARMEL

AND ELIJAH CAME NEAR TO ALL THE PEOPLE AND SAID HOW LONG WILL YOU GO LIMPING BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT OPINIONS

IF THE LORD IS GOD FOLLOW HIM; BUT IF BAAL THEN FOLLOW HIM

 AND THE PEOPLE DID NOT ANSWER HIM A WORD

THEN ELIJAH SAID TO THE PEOPLE I EVEN I ONLY AM LEFT A PROPHET OF THE LORD BUT BAAL'S PROPHETS ARE  MEN

LET TWO BULLS BE GIVEN TO US AND LET THEM CHOOSE ONE BULL FOR THEMSELVES AND CUT IT IN PIECES AND LAY IT ON THE WOOD BUT PUT NO FIRE TO IT

AND I WILL PREPARE THE OTHER BULL AND LAY IT ON THE WOOD AND PUT NO FIRE TO IT

AND YOU CALL UPON THE NAME OF YOUR GOD AND I WILL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD AND THE GOD WHO ANSWERS BY FIRE HE IS GOD

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED IT IS WELL SPOKEN

 THEN ELIJAH SAID TO THE PROPHETS OF BAAL CHOOSE FOR YOURSELVES ONE BULL AND PREPARE IT FIRST FOR YOU ARE MANY AND CALL UPON THE NAME OF YOUR GOD BUT PUT NO FIRE TO IT

 AND THEY TOOK THE BULL THAT WAS GIVEN THEM AND THEY PREPARED IT AND CALLED UPON THE NAME OF BAAL FROM MORNING UNTIL NOON SAYING O BAAL ANSWER US

 BUT THERE WAS NO VOICE AND NO ONE ANSWERED

AND THEY LIMPED AROUND THE ALTAR THAT THEY HAD MADE

AND AT NOON ELIJAH MOCKED THEM SAYING CRY ALOUD FOR HE IS A GOD

EITHER HE IS MUSING OR HE IS RELIEVING HIMSELF OR HE IS ON A JOURNEY OR PERHAPS HE IS ASLEEP AND MUST BE AWAKENED

 AND THEY CRIED ALOUD AND CUT THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR CUSTOM WITH SWORDS AND LANCES UNTIL THE BLOOD GUSHED OUT UPON THEM

AND AS MIDDAY PASSED THEY RAVED ON UNTIL THE TIME OF THE OFFERING OF THE OBLATION BUT THERE WAS NO VOICE

NO ONE ANSWERED; NO ONE PAID ATTENTION

THEN ELIJAH SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE COME NEAR TO ME

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME NEAR TO HIM

AND HE REPAIRED THE ALTAR OF THE LORD THAT HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN

ELIJAH TOOK TWELVE STONES ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE TRIBES OF THE SONS OF JACOB TO WHOM THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME SAYING ISRAEL SHALL BE YOUR NAME AND WITH THE STONES HE BUILT AN ALTAR IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND HE MADE A TRENCH ABOUT THE ALTAR AS GREAT AS WOULD CONTAIN TWO SEAHS OF SEED

AND HE PUT THE WOOD IN ORDER AND CUT THE BULL IN PIECES AND LAID IT ON THE WOOD

AND HE SAID FILL FOUR JARS WITH WATER AND POUR IT ON THE BURNT OFFERING AND ON THE WOOD

 AND HE SAID DO IT A SECOND TIME

 AND THEY DID IT A SECOND TIME

AND HE SAID DO IT A THIRD TIME

 AND THEY DID IT A THIRD TIME

AND THE WATER RAN AROUND THE ALTAR AND FILLED THE TRENCH ALSO WITH WATER

AND AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING OF THE OBLATION ELIJAH THE PROPHET CAME NEAR AND SAID O LORD GOD OF ABRAHAM ISAAC AND ISRAEL LET IT BE KNOWN THIS DAY THAT YOU ARE GOD IN ISRAEL AND THAT I AM YOUR SERVANT AND THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AT YOUR WORD

ANSWER ME O LORD ANSWER ME THAT THIS PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT YOU O LORD ARE GOD AND THAT YOU HAVE TURNED THEIR HEARTS BACK

 THEN THE FIRE OF THE LORD FELL AND CONSUMED THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE WOOD AND THE STONES AND THE DUST AND LICKED UP THE WATER THAT WAS IN THE TRENCH

AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAW IT THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES AND SAID THE LORD HE IS GOD; THE LORD HE IS GOD

 AND ELIJAH SAID TO THEM SEIZE THE PROPHETS OF BAAL; LET NOT ONE OF THEM ESCAPE

 AND THEY SEIZED THEM

AND ELIJAH BROUGHT THEM DOWN TO THE BROOK KISHON AND SLAUGHTERED THEM THERE

AND ELIJAH SAID TO AHAB GO UP EAT AND DRINK FOR THERE IS A SOUND OF THE RUSHING OF RAIN

 SO AHAB WENT UP TO EAT AND TO DRINK

AND ELIJAH WENT UP TO THE TOP OF MOUNT CARMEL

AND HE BOWED HIMSELF DOWN ON THE EARTH AND PUT HIS FACE BETWEEN HIS KNEES

AND HE SAID TO HIS SERVANT GO UP NOW LOOK TOWARD THE SEA

 AND HE WENT UP AND LOOKED AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING

 AND HE SAID GO AGAIN SEVEN TIMES

AND AT THE SEVENTH TIME HE SAID BEHOLD A LITTLE CLOUD LIKE A MAN'S HAND IS RISING FROM THE SEA

 AND HE SAID GO UP SAY TO AHAB 'PREPARE YOUR CHARIOT AND GO DOWN LEST THE RAIN STOP YOU

' AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE HEAVENS GREW BLACK WITH CLOUDS AND WIND AND THERE WAS A GREAT RAIN

AND AHAB RODE AND WENT TO JEZREEL

AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS ON ELIJAH AND HE GATHERED UP HIS GARMENT AND RAN BEFORE AHAB TO THE ENTRANCE OF JEZREEL

AHAB TOLD JEZEBEL ALL THAT ELIJAH HAD DONE AND HOW HE HAD KILLED ALL THE PROPHETS WITH THE SWORD

THEN JEZEBEL SENT A MESSENGER TO ELIJAH SAYING SO MAY THE GODS DO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF I DO NOT MAKE YOUR LIFE AS THE LIFE OF ONE OF THEM BY THIS TIME TOMORROW

 THEN HE WAS AFRAID AND HE AROSE AND RAN FOR HIS LIFE AND CAME TO BEERSHEBA WHICH BELONGS TO JUDAH AND LEFT HIS SERVANT THERE

BUT HE HIMSELF WENT A DAY'S JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS AND CAME AND SAT DOWN UNDER A BROOM TREE

AND HE ASKED THAT HE MIGHT DIE SAYING IT IS ENOUGH; NOW O LORD TAKE AWAY MY LIFE FOR I AM NO BETTER THAN MY FATHERS

 AND HE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT UNDER A BROOM TREE

AND BEHOLD AN ANGEL TOUCHED HIM AND SAID TO HIM ARISE AND EAT

 AND HE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THERE WAS AT HIS HEAD A CAKE BAKED ON HOT STONES AND A JAR OF WATER

AND HE ATE AND DRANK AND LAY DOWN AGAIN

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME AGAIN A SECOND TIME AND TOUCHED HIM AND SAID ARISE AND EAT FOR THE JOURNEY IS TOO GREAT FOR YOU

 AND HE AROSE AND ATE AND DRANK AND WENT IN THE STRENGTH OF THAT FOOD FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS TO HOREB THE MOUNT OF GOD

THERE HE CAME TO A CAVE AND LODGED IN IT

AND BEHOLD THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO HIM AND HE SAID TO HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ELIJAH

 HE SAID I HAVE BEEN VERY JEALOUS FOR THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS

FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAVE FORSAKEN YOUR COVENANT THROWN DOWN YOUR ALTARS AND KILLED YOUR PROPHETS WITH THE SWORD AND I EVEN I ONLY AM LEFT AND THEY SEEK MY LIFE TO TAKE IT AWAY

 AND HE SAID GO OUT AND STAND ON THE MOUNT BEFORE THE LORD

 AND BEHOLD THE LORD PASSED BY AND A GREAT AND STRONG WIND TORE THE MOUNTAINS AND BROKE IN PIECES THE ROCKS BEFORE THE LORD BUT THE LORD WAS NOT IN THE WIND

AND AFTER THE WIND AN EARTHQUAKE BUT THE LORD WAS NOT IN THE EARTHQUAKE

AND AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE A FIRE BUT THE LORD WAS NOT IN THE FIRE

AND AFTER THE FIRE THE SOUND OF A LOW WHISPER

AND WHEN ELIJAH HEARD IT HE WRAPPED HIS FACE IN HIS CLOAK AND WENT OUT AND STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE

AND BEHOLD THERE CAME A VOICE TO HIM AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ELIJAH

 HE SAID I HAVE BEEN VERY JEALOUS FOR THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS

FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAVE FORSAKEN YOUR COVENANT THROWN DOWN YOUR ALTARS AND KILLED YOUR PROPHETS WITH THE SWORD AND I EVEN I ONLY AM LEFT AND THEY SEEK MY LIFE TO TAKE IT AWAY

 AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM GO RETURN ON YOUR WAY TO THE WILDERNESS OF DAMASCUS

AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE YOU SHALL ANOINT HAZAEL TO BE KING OVER SYRIA

AND JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI YOU SHALL ANOINT TO BE KING OVER ISRAEL AND ELISHA THE SON OF SHAPHAT OF ABELMEHOLAH YOU SHALL ANOINT TO BE PROPHET IN YOUR PLACE

AND THE ONE WHO ESCAPES FROM THE SWORD OF HAZAEL SHALL JEHU PUT TO DEATH AND THE ONE WHO ESCAPES FROM THE SWORD OF JEHU SHALL ELISHA PUT TO DEATH

YET I WILL LEAVE SEVEN THOUSAND IN ISRAEL ALL THE KNEES THAT HAVE NOT BOWED TO BAAL AND EVERY MOUTH THAT HAS NOT KISSED HIM

 SO HE DEPARTED FROM THERE AND FOUND ELISHA THE SON OF SHAPHAT WHO WAS PLOWING WITH TWELVE YOKE OF OXEN IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE WAS WITH THE TWELFTH

ELIJAH PASSED BY HIM AND CAST HIS CLOAK UPON HIM

AND HE LEFT THE OXEN AND RAN AFTER ELIJAH AND SAID LET ME KISS MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER AND THEN I WILL FOLLOW YOU

 AND HE SAID TO HIM GO BACK AGAIN FOR WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU

 AND HE RETURNED FROM FOLLOWING HIM AND TOOK THE YOKE OF OXEN AND SACRIFICED THEM AND BOILED THEIR FLESH WITH THE YOKES OF THE OXEN AND GAVE IT TO THE PEOPLE AND THEY ATE

THEN HE AROSE AND WENT AFTER ELIJAH AND ASSISTED HIM

BENHADAD THE KING OF SYRIA GATHERED ALL HIS ARMY TOGETHER

THIRTYTWO KINGS WERE WITH HIM AND HORSES AND CHARIOTS

AND HE WENT UP AND CLOSED IN ON SAMARIA AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT

AND HE SENT MESSENGERS INTO THE CITY TO AHAB KING OF ISRAEL AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS BENHADAD 'YOUR SILVER AND YOUR GOLD ARE MINE; YOUR BEST WIVES AND CHILDREN ALSO ARE MINE

' AND THE KING OF ISRAEL ANSWERED AS YOU SAY MY LORD O KING I AM YOURS AND ALL THAT I HAVE

 THE MESSENGERS CAME AGAIN AND SAID THUS SAYS BENHADAD 'I SENT TO YOU SAYING DELIVER TO ME YOUR SILVER AND YOUR GOLD YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN

 NEVERTHELESS I WILL SEND MY SERVANTS TO YOU TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME AND THEY SHALL SEARCH YOUR HOUSE AND THE HOUSES OF YOUR SERVANTS AND LAY HANDS ON WHATEVER PLEASES YOU AND TAKE IT AWAY

' THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL CALLED ALL THE ELDERS OF THE LAND AND SAID MARK NOW AND SEE HOW THIS MAN IS SEEKING TROUBLE FOR HE SENT TO ME FOR MY WIVES AND MY CHILDREN AND FOR MY SILVER AND MY GOLD AND I DID NOT REFUSE HIM

 AND ALL THE ELDERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID TO HIM DO NOT LISTEN OR CONSENT

 SO HE SAID TO THE MESSENGERS OF BENHADAD TELL MY LORD THE KING 'ALL THAT YOU FIRST DEMANDED OF YOUR SERVANT I WILL DO BUT THIS THING I CANNOT DO

' AND THE MESSENGERS DEPARTED AND BROUGHT HIM WORD AGAIN

BENHADAD SENT TO HIM AND SAID THE GODS DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF THE DUST OF SAMARIA SHALL SUFFICE FOR HANDFULS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW ME

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL ANSWERED TELL HIM 'LET NOT HIM WHO STRAPS ON HIS ARMOR BOAST HIMSELF LIKE HE WHO TAKES IT OFF

' WHEN BENHADAD HEARD THIS MESSAGE AS HE WAS DRINKING WITH THE KINGS IN THE BOOTHS HE SAID TO HIS MEN TAKE YOUR POSITIONS

 AND THEY TOOK THEIR POSITIONS AGAINST THE CITY

AND BEHOLD A PROPHET CAME NEAR TO AHAB KING OF ISRAEL AND SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD HAVE YOU SEEN ALL THIS GREAT MULTITUDE

BEHOLD I WILL GIVE IT INTO YOUR HAND THIS DAY AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 AND AHAB SAID BY WHOM

 HE SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD BY THE SERVANTS OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE DISTRICTS

 THEN HE SAID WHO SHALL BEGIN THE BATTLE

 HE ANSWERED YOU

 THEN HE MUSTERED THE SERVANTS OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE DISTRICTS AND THEY WERE 

AND AFTER THEM HE MUSTERED ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SEVEN THOUSAND

AND THEY WENT OUT AT NOON WHILE BENHADAD WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE BOOTHS HE AND THE THIRTYTWO KINGS WHO HELPED HIM

THE SERVANTS OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE DISTRICTS WENT OUT FIRST

AND BENHADAD SENT OUT SCOUTS AND THEY REPORTED TO HIM MEN ARE COMING OUT FROM SAMARIA

 HE SAID IF THEY HAVE COME OUT FOR PEACE TAKE THEM ALIVE

OR IF THEY HAVE COME OUT FOR WAR TAKE THEM ALIVE

 SO THESE WENT OUT OF THE CITY THE SERVANTS OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE DISTRICTS AND THE ARMY THAT FOLLOWED THEM

AND EACH STRUCK DOWN HIS MAN

THE SYRIANS FLED AND ISRAEL PURSUED THEM BUT BENHADAD KING OF SYRIA ESCAPED ON A HORSE WITH HORSEMEN

AND THE KING OF ISRAEL WENT OUT AND STRUCK THE HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND STRUCK THE SYRIANS WITH A GREAT BLOW

THEN THE PROPHET CAME NEAR TO THE KING OF ISRAEL AND SAID TO HIM COME STRENGTHEN YOURSELF AND CONSIDER WELL WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR IN THE SPRING THE KING OF SYRIA WILL COME UP AGAINST YOU

 AND THE SERVANTS OF THE KING OF SYRIA SAID TO HIM THEIR GODS ARE GODS OF THE HILLS AND SO THEY WERE STRONGER THAN WE

BUT LET US FIGHT AGAINST THEM IN THE PLAIN AND SURELY WE SHALL BE STRONGER THAN THEY

AND DO THIS REMOVE THE KINGS EACH FROM HIS POST AND PUT COMMANDERS IN THEIR PLACES AND MUSTER AN ARMY LIKE THE ARMY THAT YOU HAVE LOST HORSE FOR HORSE AND CHARIOT FOR CHARIOT

THEN WE WILL FIGHT AGAINST THEM IN THE PLAIN AND SURELY WE SHALL BE STRONGER THAN THEY

 AND HE LISTENED TO THEIR VOICE AND DID SO

IN THE SPRING BENHADAD MUSTERED THE SYRIANS AND WENT UP TO APHEK TO FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE MUSTERED AND WERE PROVISIONED AND WENT AGAINST THEM

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ENCAMPED BEFORE THEM LIKE TWO LITTLE FLOCKS OF GOATS BUT THE SYRIANS FILLED THE COUNTRY

AND A MAN OF GOD CAME NEAR AND SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BECAUSE THE SYRIANS HAVE SAID THE LORD IS A GOD OF THE HILLS BUT HE IS NOT A GOD OF THE VALLEYS THEREFORE I WILL GIVE ALL THIS GREAT MULTITUDE INTO YOUR HAND AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

' AND THEY ENCAMPED OPPOSITE ONE ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS

THEN ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE BATTLE WAS JOINED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL STRUCK DOWN OF THE SYRIANS  FOOT SOLDIERS IN ONE DAY

AND THE REST FLED INTO THE CITY OF APHEK AND THE WALL FELL UPON  MEN WHO WERE LEFT

BENHADAD ALSO FLED AND ENTERED AN INNER CHAMBER IN THE CITY

AND HIS SERVANTS SAID TO HIM BEHOLD NOW WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE KINGS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE MERCIFUL KINGS

LET US PUT SACKCLOTH AROUND OUR WAISTS AND ROPES ON OUR HEADS AND GO OUT TO THE KING OF ISRAEL

PERHAPS HE WILL SPARE YOUR LIFE

 SO THEY TIED SACKCLOTH AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND PUT ROPES ON THEIR HEADS AND WENT TO THE KING OF ISRAEL AND SAID YOUR SERVANT BENHADAD SAYS 'PLEASE LET ME LIVE

' AND HE SAID DOES HE STILL LIVE

HE IS MY BROTHER

 NOW THE MEN WERE WATCHING FOR A SIGN AND THEY QUICKLY TOOK IT UP FROM HIM AND SAID YES YOUR BROTHER BENHADAD

 THEN HE SAID GO AND BRING HIM

 THEN BENHADAD CAME OUT TO HIM AND HE CAUSED HIM TO COME UP INTO THE CHARIOT

AND BENHADAD SAID TO HIM THE CITIES THAT MY FATHER TOOK FROM YOUR FATHER I WILL RESTORE AND YOU MAY ESTABLISH BAZAARS FOR YOURSELF IN DAMASCUS AS MY FATHER DID IN SAMARIA

 AND AHAB SAID I WILL LET YOU GO ON THESE TERMS

 SO HE MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM AND LET HIM GO

AND A CERTAIN MAN OF THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS SAID TO HIS FELLOW AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD STRIKE ME PLEASE

 BUT THE MAN REFUSED TO STRIKE HIM

THEN HE SAID TO HIM BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD BEHOLD AS SOON AS YOU HAVE GONE FROM ME A LION SHALL STRIKE YOU DOWN

 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD DEPARTED FROM HIM A LION MET HIM AND STRUCK HIM DOWN

THEN HE FOUND ANOTHER MAN AND SAID STRIKE ME PLEASE

 AND THE MAN STRUCK HIMSTRUCK HIM AND WOUNDED HIM

SO THE PROPHET DEPARTED AND WAITED FOR THE KING BY THE WAY DISGUISING HIMSELF WITH A BANDAGE OVER HIS EYES

AND AS THE KING PASSED HE CRIED TO THE KING AND SAID YOUR SERVANT WENT OUT INTO THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE AND BEHOLD A SOLDIER TURNED AND BROUGHT A MAN TO ME AND SAID 'GUARD THIS MAN; IF BY ANY MEANS HE IS MISSING YOUR LIFE SHALL BE FOR HIS LIFE OR ELSE YOU SHALL PAY A TALENT OF SILVER

' AND AS YOUR SERVANT WAS BUSY HERE AND THERE HE WAS GONE

 THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO HIM SO SHALL YOUR JUDGMENT BE; YOU YOURSELF HAVE DECIDED IT

 THEN HE HURRIED TO TAKE THE BANDAGE AWAY FROM HIS EYES AND THE KING OF ISRAEL RECOGNIZED HIM AS ONE OF THE PROPHETS

AND HE SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BECAUSE YOU HAVE LET GO OUT OF YOUR HAND THE MAN WHOM I HAD DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION THEREFORE YOUR LIFE SHALL BE FOR HIS LIFE AND YOUR PEOPLE FOR HIS PEOPLE

' AND THE KING OF ISRAEL WENT TO HIS HOUSE VEXED AND SULLEN AND CAME TO SAMARIA

NOW NABOTH THE JEZREELITE HAD A VINEYARD IN JEZREEL BESIDE THE PALACE OF AHAB KING OF SAMARIA

AND AFTER THIS AHAB SAID TO NABOTH GIVE ME YOUR VINEYARD THAT I MAY HAVE IT FOR A VEGETABLE GARDEN BECAUSE IT IS NEAR MY HOUSE AND I WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER VINEYARD FOR IT; OR IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU I WILL GIVE YOU ITS VALUE IN MONEY

 BUT NABOTH SAID TO AHAB THE LORD FORBID THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU THE INHERITANCE OF MY FATHERS

 AND AHAB WENT INTO HIS HOUSE VEXED AND SULLEN BECAUSE OF WHAT NABOTH THE JEZREELITE HAD SAID TO HIM FOR HE HAD SAID I WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE INHERITANCE OF MY FATHERS

 AND HE LAY DOWN ON HIS BED AND TURNED AWAY HIS FACE AND WOULD EAT NO FOOD

BUT JEZEBEL HIS WIFE CAME TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM WHY IS YOUR SPIRIT SO VEXED THAT YOU EAT NO FOOD

 AND HE SAID TO HER BECAUSE I SPOKE TO NABOTH THE JEZREELITE AND SAID TO HIM 'GIVE ME YOUR VINEYARD FOR MONEY OR ELSE IF IT PLEASE YOU I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER VINEYARD FOR IT

' AND HE ANSWERED 'I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY VINEYARD

' AND JEZEBEL HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM DO YOU NOW GOVERN ISRAEL

ARISE AND EAT BREAD AND LET YOUR HEART BE CHEERFUL; I WILL GIVE YOU THE VINEYARD OF NABOTH THE JEZREELITE

 SO SHE WROTE LETTERS IN AHAB'S NAME AND SEALED THEM WITH HIS SEAL AND SHE SENT THE LETTERS TO THE ELDERS AND THE LEADERS WHO LIVED WITH NABOTH IN HIS CITY

AND SHE WROTE IN THE LETTERS PROCLAIM A FAST AND SET NABOTH AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE

AND SET TWO WORTHLESS MEN OPPOSITE HIM AND LET THEM BRING A CHARGE AGAINST HIM SAYING 'YOU HAVE CURSED GOD AND THE KING

' THEN TAKE HIM OUT AND STONE HIM TO DEATH

 AND THE MEN OF HIS CITY THE ELDERS AND THE LEADERS WHO LIVED IN HIS CITY DID AS JEZEBEL HAD SENT WORD TO THEM

AS IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE LETTERS THAT SHE HAD SENT TO THEM THEY PROCLAIMED A FAST AND SET NABOTH AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE

AND THE TWO WORTHLESS MEN CAME IN AND SAT OPPOSITE HIM

AND THE WORTHLESS MEN BROUGHT A CHARGE AGAINST NABOTH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE SAYING NABOTH CURSED GOD AND THE KING

 SO THEY TOOK HIM OUTSIDE THE CITY AND STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES

THEN THEY SENT TO JEZEBEL SAYING NABOTH HAS BEEN STONED; HE IS DEAD

 AS SOON AS JEZEBEL HEARD THAT NABOTH HAD BEEN STONED AND WAS DEAD JEZEBEL SAID TO AHAB ARISE TAKE POSSESSION OF THE VINEYARD OF NABOTH THE JEZREELITE WHICH HE REFUSED TO GIVE YOU FOR MONEY FOR NABOTH IS NOT ALIVE BUT DEAD

 AND AS SOON AS AHAB HEARD THAT NABOTH WAS DEAD AHAB AROSE TO GO DOWN TO THE VINEYARD OF NABOTH THE JEZREELITE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ELIJAH THE TISHBITE SAYING ARISE GO DOWN TO MEET AHAB KING OF ISRAEL WHO IS IN SAMARIA; BEHOLD HE IS IN THE VINEYARD OF NABOTH WHERE HE HAS GONE TO TAKE POSSESSION

AND YOU SHALL SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD HAVE YOU KILLED AND ALSO TAKEN POSSESSION

' AND YOU SHALL SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD IN THE PLACE WHERE DOGS LICKED UP THE BLOOD OF NABOTH SHALL DOGS LICK YOUR OWN BLOOD

' AHAB SAID TO ELIJAH HAVE YOU FOUND ME O MY ENEMY

 HE ANSWERED I HAVE FOUND YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOLD YOURSELF TO DO WHAT IS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

BEHOLD I WILL BRING DISASTER UPON YOU

I WILL UTTERLY BURN YOU UP AND WILL CUT OFF FROM AHAB EVERY MALE BOND OR FREE IN ISRAEL

AND I WILL MAKE YOUR HOUSE LIKE THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT AND LIKE THE HOUSE OF BAASHA THE SON OF AHIJAH FOR THE ANGER TO WHICH YOU HAVE PROVOKED ME AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

AND OF JEZEBEL THE LORD ALSO SAID 'THE DOGS SHALL EAT JEZEBEL WITHIN THE WALLS OF JEZREEL

' ANYONE BELONGING TO AHAB WHO DIES IN THE CITY THE DOGS SHALL EAT AND ANYONE OF HIS WHO DIES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS SHALL EAT

 THERE WAS NONE WHO SOLD HIMSELF TO DO WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD LIKE AHAB WHOM JEZEBEL HIS WIFE INCITED

HE ACTED VERY ABOMINABLY IN GOING AFTER IDOLS AS THE AMORITES HAD DONE WHOM THE LORD CAST OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 AND WHEN AHAB HEARD THOSE WORDS HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND PUT SACKCLOTH ON HIS FLESH AND FASTED AND LAY IN SACKCLOTH AND WENT ABOUT DEJECTEDLY

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ELIJAH THE TISHBITE SAYING HAVE YOU SEEN HOW AHAB HAS HUMBLED HIMSELF BEFORE ME

BECAUSE HE HAS HUMBLED HIMSELF BEFORE ME I WILL NOT BRING THE DISASTER IN HIS DAYS; BUT IN HIS SON'S DAYS I WILL BRING THE DISASTER UPON HIS HOUSE

FOR THREE YEARS SYRIA AND ISRAEL CONTINUED WITHOUT WAR

BUT IN THE THIRD YEAR JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH CAME DOWN TO THE KING OF ISRAEL

AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO HIS SERVANTS DO YOU KNOW THAT RAMOTHGILEAD BELONGS TO US AND WE KEEP QUIET AND DO NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE HAND OF THE KING OF SYRIA

 AND HE SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO BATTLE AT RAMOTHGILEAD

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL I AM AS YOU ARE MY PEOPLE AS YOUR PEOPLE MY HORSES AS YOUR HORSES

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL INQUIRE FIRST FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD

 THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL GATHERED THE PROPHETS TOGETHER ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEN AND SAID TO THEM SHALL I GO TO BATTLE AGAINST RAMOTHGILEAD OR SHALL I REFRAIN

 AND THEY SAID GO UP FOR THE LORD WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF THE KING

 BUT JEHOSHAPHAT SAID IS THERE NOT HERE ANOTHER PROPHET OF THE LORD OF WHOM WE MAY INQUIRE

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT THERE IS YET ONE MAN BY WHOM WE MAY INQUIRE OF THE LORD MICAIAH THE SON OF IMLAH BUT I HATE HIM FOR HE NEVER PROPHESIES GOOD CONCERNING ME BUT EVIL

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID LET NOT THE KING SAY SO

 THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL SUMMONED AN OFFICER AND SAID BRING QUICKLY MICAIAH THE SON OF IMLAH

 NOW THE KING OF ISRAEL AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH WERE SITTING ON THEIR THRONES ARRAYED IN THEIR ROBES AT THE THRESHING FLOOR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF SAMARIA AND ALL THE PROPHETS WERE PROPHESYING BEFORE THEM

AND ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF CHENAANAH MADE FOR HIMSELF HORNS OF IRON AND SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD 'WITH THESE YOU SHALL PUSH THE SYRIANS UNTIL THEY ARE DESTROYED

' AND ALL THE PROPHETS PROPHESIED SO AND SAID GO UP TO RAMOTHGILEAD AND TRIUMPH; THE LORD WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF THE KING

 AND THE MESSENGER WHO WENT TO SUMMON MICAIAH SAID TO HIM BEHOLD THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS WITH ONE ACCORD ARE FAVORABLE TO THE KING

LET YOUR WORD BE LIKE THE WORD OF ONE OF THEM AND SPEAK FAVORABLY

 BUT MICAIAH SAID AS THE LORD LIVES WHAT THE LORD SAYS TO ME THAT I WILL SPEAK

 AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO THE KING THE KING SAID TO HIM MICAIAH SHALL WE GO TO RAMOTHGILEAD TO BATTLE OR SHALL WE REFRAIN

 AND HE ANSWERED HIM GO UP AND TRIUMPH; THE LORD WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF THE KING

 BUT THE KING SAID TO HIM HOW MANY TIMES SHALL I MAKE YOU SWEAR THAT YOU SPEAK TO ME NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

 AND HE SAID I SAW ALL ISRAEL SCATTERED ON THE MOUNTAINS AS SHEEP THAT HAVE NO SHEPHERD

AND THE LORD SAID 'THESE HAVE NO MASTER; LET EACH RETURN TO HIS HOME IN PEACE

' AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT HE WOULD NOT PROPHESY GOOD CONCERNING ME BUT EVIL

 AND MICAIAH SAID THEREFORE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD I SAW THE LORD SITTING ON HIS THRONE AND ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN STANDING BESIDE HIM ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT; AND THE LORD SAID 'WHO WILL ENTICE AHAB THAT HE MAY GO UP AND FALL AT RAMOTHGILEAD

' AND ONE SAID ONE THING AND ANOTHER SAID ANOTHER

THEN A SPIRIT CAME FORWARD AND STOOD BEFORE THE LORD SAYING 'I WILL ENTICE HIM

' AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM 'BY WHAT MEANS

' AND HE SAID 'I WILL GO OUT AND WILL BE A LYING SPIRIT IN THE MOUTH OF ALL HIS PROPHETS

' AND HE SAID 'YOU ARE TO ENTICE HIM AND YOU SHALL SUCCEED; GO OUT AND DO SO

' NOW THEREFORE BEHOLD THE LORD HAS PUT A LYING SPIRIT IN THE MOUTH OF ALL THESE YOUR PROPHETS; THE LORD HAS DECLARED DISASTER FOR YOU

 THEN ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF CHENAANAH CAME NEAR AND STRUCK MICAIAH ON THE CHEEK AND SAID HOW DID THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GO FROM ME TO SPEAK TO YOU

 AND MICAIAH SAID BEHOLD YOU SHALL SEE ON THAT DAY WHEN YOU GO INTO AN INNER CHAMBER TO HIDE YOURSELF

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID SEIZE MICAIAH AND TAKE HIM BACK TO AMON THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY AND TO JOASH THE KING'S SON AND SAY 'THUS SAYS THE KING PUT THIS FELLOW IN PRISON AND FEED HIM MEAGER RATIONS OF BREAD AND WATER UNTIL I COME IN PEACE

' AND MICAIAH SAID IF YOU RETURN IN PEACE THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN BY ME

 AND HE SAID HEAR ALL YOU PEOPLES

 SO THE KING OF ISRAEL AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH WENT UP TO RAMOTHGILEAD

AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT I WILL DISGUISE MYSELF AND GO INTO BATTLE BUT YOU WEAR YOUR ROBES

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL DISGUISED HIMSELF AND WENT INTO BATTLE

NOW THE KING OF SYRIA HAD COMMANDED THE THIRTYTWO CAPTAINS OF HIS CHARIOTS FIGHT WITH NEITHER SMALL NOR GREAT BUT ONLY WITH THE KING OF ISRAEL

 AND WHEN THE CAPTAINS OF THE CHARIOTS SAW JEHOSHAPHAT THEY SAID IT IS SURELY THE KING OF ISRAEL

 SO THEY TURNED TO FIGHT AGAINST HIM

AND JEHOSHAPHAT CRIED OUT

AND WHEN THE CAPTAINS OF THE CHARIOTS SAW THAT IT WAS NOT THE KING OF ISRAEL THEY TURNED BACK FROM PURSUING HIM

BUT A CERTAIN MAN DREW HIS BOW AT RANDOM AND STRUCK THE KING OF ISRAEL BETWEEN THE SCALE ARMOR AND THE BREASTPLATE

THEREFORE HE SAID TO THE DRIVER OF HIS CHARIOT TURN AROUND AND CARRY ME OUT OF THE BATTLE FOR I AM WOUNDED

 AND THE BATTLE CONTINUED THAT DAY AND THE KING WAS PROPPED UP IN HIS CHARIOT FACING THE SYRIANS UNTIL AT EVENING HE DIED

AND THE BLOOD OF THE WOUND FLOWED INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE CHARIOT

AND ABOUT SUNSET A CRY WENT THROUGH THE ARMY EVERY MAN TO HIS CITY AND EVERY MAN TO HIS COUNTRY

 SO THE KING DIED AND WAS BROUGHT TO SAMARIA

AND THEY BURIED THE KING IN SAMARIA

AND THEY WASHED THE CHARIOT BY THE POOL OF SAMARIA AND THE DOGS LICKED UP HIS BLOOD AND THE PROSTITUTES WASHED THEMSELVES IN IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE HAD SPOKEN

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF AHAB AND ALL THAT HE DID AND THE IVORY HOUSE THAT HE BUILT AND ALL THE CITIES THAT HE BUILT ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

SO AHAB SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND AHAZIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF ASA BEGAN TO REIGN OVER JUDAH IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF AHAB KING OF ISRAEL

JEHOSHAPHAT WAS THIRTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWENTYFIVE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS AZUBAH THE DAUGHTER OF SHILHI

HE WALKED IN ALL THE WAY OF ASA HIS FATHER

HE DID NOT TURN ASIDE FROM IT DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

YET THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY AND THE PEOPLE STILL SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES

JEHOSHAPHAT ALSO MADE PEACE WITH THE KING OF ISRAEL

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOSHAPHAT AND HIS MIGHT THAT HE SHOWED AND HOW HE WARRED ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND FROM THE LAND HE EXTERMINATED THE REMNANT OF THE MALE CULT PROSTITUTES WHO REMAINED IN THE DAYS OF HIS FATHER ASA

THERE WAS NO KING IN EDOM; A DEPUTY WAS KING

JEHOSHAPHAT MADE SHIPS OF TARSHISH TO GO TO OPHIR FOR GOLD BUT THEY DID NOT GO FOR THE SHIPS WERE WRECKED AT EZIONGEBER

THEN AHAZIAH THE SON OF AHAB SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT LET MY SERVANTS GO WITH YOUR SERVANTS IN THE SHIPS BUT JEHOSHAPHAT WAS NOT WILLING

AND JEHOSHAPHAT SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND JEHORAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AHAZIAH THE SON OF AHAB BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA IN THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR OF JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH AND HE REIGNED TWO YEARS OVER ISRAEL

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND WALKED IN THE WAY OF HIS FATHER AND IN THE WAY OF HIS MOTHER AND IN THE WAY OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHO MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

HE SERVED BAAL AND WORSHIPED HIM AND PROVOKED THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO ANGER IN EVERY WAY THAT HIS FATHER HAD DONE

MARKTHE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD

AS IT IS WRITTEN IN ISAIAH THE PROPHET BEHOLD I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS 'PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT' JOHN APPEARED BAPTIZING IN THE WILDERNESS AND PROCLAIMING A BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

AND ALL THE COUNTRY OF JUDEA AND ALL JERUSALEM WERE GOING OUT TO HIM AND WERE BEING BAPTIZED BY HIM IN THE RIVER JORDAN CONFESSING THEIR SINS

NOW JOHN WAS CLOTHED WITH CAMEL'S HAIR AND WORE A LEATHER BELT AROUND HIS WAIST AND ATE LOCUSTS AND WILD HONEY

AND HE PREACHED SAYING AFTER ME COMES HE WHO IS MIGHTIER THAN I THE STRAP OF WHOSE SANDALS I AM NOT WORTHY TO STOOP DOWN AND UNTIE

I HAVE BAPTIZED YOU WITH WATER BUT HE WILL BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

 IN THOSE DAYS JESUS CAME FROM NAZARETH OF GALILEE AND WAS BAPTIZED BY JOHN IN THE JORDAN

AND WHEN HE CAME UP OUT OF THE WATER IMMEDIATELY HE SAW THE HEAVENS OPENING AND THE SPIRIT DESCENDING ON HIM LIKE A DOVE

AND A VOICE CAME FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE MY BELOVED SON; WITH YOU I AM WELL PLEASED

 THE SPIRIT IMMEDIATELY DROVE HIM OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS

AND HE WAS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY DAYS BEING TEMPTED BY SATAN

AND HE WAS WITH THE WILD ANIMALS AND THE ANGELS WERE MINISTERING TO HIM

NOW AFTER JOHN WAS ARRESTED JESUS CAME INTO GALILEE PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL OF GOD AND SAYING THE TIME IS FULFILLED AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND; REPENT AND BELIEVE IN THE GOSPEL

 PASSING ALONGSIDE THE SEA OF GALILEE HE SAW SIMON AND ANDREW THE BROTHER OF SIMON CASTING A NET INTO THE SEA FOR THEY WERE FISHERMEN

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM FOLLOW ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU BECOME FISHERS OF MEN

 AND IMMEDIATELY THEY LEFT THEIR NETS AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND GOING ON A LITTLE FARTHER HE SAW JAMES THE SON OF ZEBEDEE AND JOHN HIS BROTHER WHO WERE IN THEIR BOAT MENDING THE NETS

AND IMMEDIATELY HE CALLED THEM AND THEY LEFT THEIR FATHER ZEBEDEE IN THE BOAT WITH THE HIRED SERVANTS AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND THEY WENT INTO CAPERNAUM AND IMMEDIATELY ON THE SABBATH HE ENTERED THE SYNAGOGUE AND WAS TEACHING

AND THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING FOR HE TAUGHT THEM AS ONE WHO HAD AUTHORITY AND NOT AS THE SCRIBES

AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS IN THEIR SYNAGOGUE A MAN WITH AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT

AND HE CRIED OUT WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH US JESUS OF NAZARETH

HAVE YOU COME TO DESTROY US

I KNOW WHO YOU ARETHE HOLY ONE OF GOD

 BUT JESUS REBUKED HIM SAYING BE SILENT AND COME OUT OF HIM

 AND THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT CONVULSING HIM AND CRYING OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE CAME OUT OF HIM

AND THEY WERE ALL AMAZED SO THAT THEY QUESTIONED AMONG THEMSELVES SAYING WHAT IS THIS

A NEW TEACHING WITH AUTHORITY

HE COMMANDS EVEN THE UNCLEAN SPIRITS AND THEY OBEY HIM

 AND AT ONCE HIS FAME SPREAD EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT ALL THE SURROUNDING REGION OF GALILEE

AND IMMEDIATELY HE LEFT THE SYNAGOGUE AND ENTERED THE HOUSE OF SIMON AND ANDREW WITH JAMES AND JOHN

NOW SIMON'S MOTHERINLAW LAY ILL WITH A FEVER AND IMMEDIATELY THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT HER

AND HE CAME AND TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LIFTED HER UP AND THE FEVER LEFT HER AND SHE BEGAN TO SERVE THEM

THAT EVENING AT SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT TO HIM ALL WHO WERE SICK OR OPPRESSED BY DEMONS

AND THE WHOLE CITY WAS GATHERED TOGETHER AT THE DOOR

AND HE HEALED MANY WHO WERE SICK WITH VARIOUS DISEASES AND CAST OUT MANY DEMONS

AND HE WOULD NOT PERMIT THE DEMONS TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY KNEW HIM

AND RISING VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING WHILE IT WAS STILL DARK HE DEPARTED AND WENT OUT TO A DESOLATE PLACE AND THERE HE PRAYED

AND SIMON AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM SEARCHED FOR HIM AND THEY FOUND HIM AND SAID TO HIM EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM LET US GO ON TO THE NEXT TOWNS THAT I MAY PREACH THERE ALSO FOR THAT IS WHY I CAME OUT

 AND HE WENT THROUGHOUT ALL GALILEE PREACHING IN THEIR SYNAGOGUES AND CASTING OUT DEMONS

AND A LEPER CAME TO HIM IMPLORING HIM AND KNEELING SAID TO HIM IF YOU WILL YOU CAN MAKE ME CLEAN

 MOVED WITH PITY HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED HIM AND SAID TO HIM I WILL; BE CLEAN

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE LEPROSY LEFT HIM AND HE WAS MADE CLEAN

AND JESUS STERNLY CHARGED HIM AND SENT HIM AWAY AT ONCE AND SAID TO HIM SEE THAT YOU SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE BUT GO SHOW YOURSELF TO THE PRIEST AND OFFER FOR YOUR CLEANSING WHAT MOSES COMMANDED FOR A PROOF TO THEM

 BUT HE WENT OUT AND BEGAN TO TALK FREELY ABOUT IT AND TO SPREAD THE NEWS SO THAT JESUS COULD NO LONGER OPENLY ENTER A TOWN BUT WAS OUT IN DESOLATE PLACES AND PEOPLE WERE COMING TO HIM FROM EVERY QUARTER

AND WHEN HE RETURNED TO CAPERNAUM AFTER SOME DAYS IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE WAS AT HOME

AND MANY WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SO THAT THERE WAS NO MORE ROOM NOT EVEN AT THE DOOR

AND HE WAS PREACHING THE WORD TO THEM

AND THEY CAME BRINGING TO HIM A PARALYTIC CARRIED BY FOUR MEN

AND WHEN THEY COULD NOT GET NEAR HIM BECAUSE OF THE CROWD THEY REMOVED THE ROOF ABOVE HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD MADE AN OPENING THEY LET DOWN THE BED ON WHICH THE PARALYTIC LAY

AND WHEN JESUS SAW THEIR FAITH HE SAID TO THE PARALYTIC MY SON YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN

 NOW SOME OF THE SCRIBES WERE SITTING THERE QUESTIONING IN THEIR HEARTS WHY DOES THIS MAN SPEAK LIKE THAT

HE IS BLASPHEMING

WHO CAN FORGIVE SINS BUT GOD ALONE

 AND IMMEDIATELY JESUS PERCEIVING IN HIS SPIRIT THAT THEY THUS QUESTIONED WITHIN THEMSELVES SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU QUESTION THESE THINGS IN YOUR HEARTS

WHICH IS EASIER TO SAY TO THE PARALYTIC 'YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN' OR TO SAY 'RISE TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK'

BUT THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS AUTHORITY ON EARTH TO FORGIVE SINSHE SAID TO THE PARALYTIC I SAY TO YOU RISE PICK UP YOUR BED AND GO HOME

 AND HE ROSE AND IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP HIS BED AND WENT OUT BEFORE THEM ALL SO THAT THEY WERE ALL AMAZED AND GLORIFIED GOD SAYING WE NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS

 HE WENT OUT AGAIN BESIDE THE SEA AND ALL THE CROWD WAS COMING TO HIM AND HE WAS TEACHING THEM

AND AS HE PASSED BY HE SAW LEVI THE SON OF ALPHAEUS SITTING AT THE TAX BOOTH AND HE SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME

 AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND AS HE RECLINED AT TABLE IN HIS HOUSE MANY TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS WERE RECLINING WITH JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES FOR THERE WERE MANY WHO FOLLOWED HIM

AND THE SCRIBES OF THE PHARISEES WHEN THEY SAW THAT HE WAS EATING WITH SINNERS AND TAX COLLECTORS SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES WHY DOES HE EAT WITH TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS

 AND WHEN JESUS HEARD IT HE SAID TO THEM THOSE WHO ARE WELL HAVE NO NEED OF A PHYSICIAN BUT THOSE WHO ARE SICK

I CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS BUT SINNERS

 NOW JOHN'S DISCIPLES AND THE PHARISEES WERE FASTING

AND PEOPLE CAME AND SAID TO HIM WHY DO JOHN'S DISCIPLES AND THE DISCIPLES OF THE PHARISEES FAST BUT YOUR DISCIPLES DO NOT FAST

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM CAN THE WEDDING GUESTS FAST WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM IS WITH THEM

AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE BRIDEGROOM WITH THEM THEY CANNOT FAST

THE DAYS WILL COME WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND THEN THEY WILL FAST IN THAT DAY

NO ONE SEWS A PIECE OF UNSHRUNK CLOTH ON AN OLD GARMENT

IF HE DOES THE PATCH TEARS AWAY FROM IT THE NEW FROM THE OLD AND A WORSE TEAR IS MADE

AND NO ONE PUTS NEW WINE INTO OLD WINESKINS

IF HE DOES THE WINE WILL BURST THE SKINSAND THE WINE IS DESTROYED AND SO ARE THE SKINS

BUT NEW WINE IS FOR FRESH WINESKINS

 ONE SABBATH HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE GRAINFIELDS AND AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY HIS DISCIPLES BEGAN TO PLUCK HEADS OF GRAIN

AND THE PHARISEES WERE SAYING TO HIM LOOK WHY ARE THEY DOING WHAT IS NOT LAWFUL ON THE SABBATH

 AND HE SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU NEVER READ WHAT DAVID DID WHEN HE WAS IN NEED AND WAS HUNGRY HE AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM HOW HE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF GOD IN THE TIME OF ABIATHAR THE HIGH PRIEST AND ATE THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE WHICH IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR ANY BUT THE PRIESTS TO EAT AND ALSO GAVE IT TO THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THE SABBATH WAS MADE FOR MAN NOT MAN FOR THE SABBATH

SO THE SON OF MAN IS LORD EVEN OF THE SABBATH

AGAIN HE ENTERED THE SYNAGOGUE AND A MAN WAS THERE WITH A WITHERED HAND

AND THEY WATCHED JESUS TO SEE WHETHER HE WOULD HEAL HIM ON THE SABBATH SO THAT THEY MIGHT ACCUSE HIM

AND HE SAID TO THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND COME HERE

 AND HE SAID TO THEM IS IT LAWFUL ON THE SABBATH TO DO GOOD OR TO DO HARM TO SAVE LIFE OR TO KILL

 BUT THEY WERE SILENT

AND HE LOOKED AROUND AT THEM WITH ANGER GRIEVED AT THEIR HARDNESS OF HEART AND SAID TO THE MAN STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND

 HE STRETCHED IT OUT AND HIS HAND WAS RESTORED

THE PHARISEES WENT OUT AND IMMEDIATELY HELD COUNSEL WITH THE HERODIANS AGAINST HIM HOW TO DESTROY HIM

JESUS WITHDREW WITH HIS DISCIPLES TO THE SEA AND A GREAT CROWD FOLLOWED FROM GALILEE AND JUDEA AND JERUSALEM AND IDUMEA AND FROM BEYOND THE JORDAN AND FROM AROUND TYRE AND SIDON

WHEN THE GREAT CROWD HEARD ALL THAT HE WAS DOING THEY CAME TO HIM

AND HE TOLD HIS DISCIPLES TO HAVE A BOAT READY FOR HIM BECAUSE OF THE CROWD LEST THEY CRUSH HIM FOR HE HAD HEALED MANY SO THAT ALL WHO HAD DISEASES PRESSED AROUND HIM TO TOUCH HIM

AND WHENEVER THE UNCLEAN SPIRITS SAW HIM THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM AND CRIED OUT YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD

 AND HE STRICTLY ORDERED THEM NOT TO MAKE HIM KNOWN

AND HE WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND CALLED TO HIM THOSE WHOM HE DESIRED AND THEY CAME TO HIM

AND HE APPOINTED TWELVE WHOM HE ALSO NAMED APOSTLES SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE WITH HIM AND HE MIGHT SEND THEM OUT TO PREACH AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO CAST OUT DEMONS

HE APPOINTED THE TWELVE SIMON TO WHOM HE GAVE THE NAME PETER; JAMES THE SON OF ZEBEDEE AND JOHN THE BROTHER OF JAMES TO WHOM HE GAVE THE NAME BOANERGES THAT IS SONS OF THUNDER; ANDREW AND PHILIP AND BARTHOLOMEW AND MATTHEW AND THOMAS AND JAMES THE SON OF ALPHAEUS AND THADDAEUS AND SIMON THE CANANAEAN AND JUDAS ISCARIOT WHO BETRAYED HIM

THEN HE WENT HOME AND THE CROWD GATHERED AGAIN SO THAT THEY COULD NOT EVEN EAT

AND WHEN HIS FAMILY HEARD IT THEY WENT OUT TO SEIZE HIM FOR THEY WERE SAYING HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND

 AND THE SCRIBES WHO CAME DOWN FROM JERUSALEM WERE SAYING HE IS POSSESSED BY BEELZEBUL AND BY THE PRINCE OF DEMONS HE CASTS OUT THE DEMONS

 AND HE CALLED THEM TO HIM AND SAID TO THEM IN PARABLES HOW CAN SATAN CAST OUT SATAN

IF A KINGDOM IS DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF THAT KINGDOM CANNOT STAND

AND IF A HOUSE IS DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF THAT HOUSE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAND

AND IF SATAN HAS RISEN UP AGAINST HIMSELF AND IS DIVIDED HE CANNOT STAND BUT IS COMING TO AN END

BUT NO ONE CAN ENTER A STRONG MAN'S HOUSE AND PLUNDER HIS GOODS UNLESS HE FIRST BINDS THE STRONG MAN

THEN INDEED HE MAY PLUNDER HIS HOUSE

TRULY I SAY TO YOU ALL SINS WILL BE FORGIVEN THE CHILDREN OF MAN AND WHATEVER BLASPHEMIES THEY UTTER BUT WHOEVER BLASPHEMES AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT NEVER HAS FORGIVENESS BUT IS GUILTY OF AN ETERNAL SIN FOR THEY HAD SAID HE HAS AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT

 AND HIS MOTHER AND HIS BROTHERS CAME AND STANDING OUTSIDE THEY SENT TO HIM AND CALLED HIM

AND A CROWD WAS SITTING AROUND HIM AND THEY SAID TO HIM YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHERS ARE OUTSIDE SEEKING YOU

 AND HE ANSWERED THEM WHO ARE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS

 AND LOOKING ABOUT AT THOSE WHO SAT AROUND HIM HE SAID HERE ARE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS

WHOEVER DOES THE WILL OF GOD HE IS MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND MOTHER

AGAIN HE BEGAN TO TEACH BESIDE THE SEA

AND A VERY LARGE CROWD GATHERED ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE GOT INTO A BOAT AND SAT IN IT ON THE SEA AND THE WHOLE CROWD WAS BESIDE THE SEA ON THE LAND

AND HE WAS TEACHING THEM MANY THINGS IN PARABLES AND IN HIS TEACHING HE SAID TO THEM LISTEN

A SOWER WENT OUT TO SOW

AND AS HE SOWED SOME SEED FELL ALONG THE PATH AND THE BIRDS CAME AND DEVOURED IT

OTHER SEED FELL ON ROCKY GROUND WHERE IT DID NOT HAVE MUCH SOIL AND IMMEDIATELY IT SPRANG UP SINCE IT HAD NO DEPTH OF SOIL

AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE IT WAS SCORCHED AND SINCE IT HAD NO ROOT IT WITHERED AWAY

OTHER SEED FELL AMONG THORNS AND THE THORNS GREW UP AND CHOKED IT AND IT YIELDED NO GRAIN

AND OTHER SEEDS FELL INTO GOOD SOIL AND PRODUCED GRAIN GROWING UP AND INCREASING AND YIELDING THIRTYFOLD AND SIXTYFOLD AND A HUNDREDFOLD

 AND HE SAID HE WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR

 AND WHEN HE WAS ALONE THOSE AROUND HIM WITH THE TWELVE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE PARABLES

AND HE SAID TO THEM TO YOU HAS BEEN GIVEN THE SECRET OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD BUT FOR THOSE OUTSIDE EVERYTHING IS IN PARABLES SO THAT THEY MAY INDEED SEE BUT NOT PERCEIVE AND MAY INDEED HEAR BUT NOT UNDERSTAND LEST THEY SHOULD TURN AND BE FORGIVEN

 AND HE SAID TO THEM DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS PARABLE

HOW THEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THE PARABLES

THE SOWER SOWS THE WORD

AND THESE ARE THE ONES ALONG THE PATH WHERE THE WORD IS SOWN WHEN THEY HEAR SATAN IMMEDIATELY COMES AND TAKES AWAY THE WORD THAT IS SOWN IN THEM

AND THESE ARE THE ONES SOWN ON ROCKY GROUND THE ONES WHO WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE IT WITH JOY

AND THEY HAVE NO ROOT IN THEMSELVES BUT ENDURE FOR A WHILE; THEN WHEN TRIBULATION OR PERSECUTION ARISES ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD IMMEDIATELY THEY FALL AWAY

AND OTHERS ARE THE ONES SOWN AMONG THORNS

THEY ARE THOSE WHO HEAR THE WORD BUT THE CARES OF THE WORLD AND THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES AND THE DESIRES FOR OTHER THINGS ENTER IN AND CHOKE THE WORD AND IT PROVES UNFRUITFUL

BUT THOSE THAT WERE SOWN ON THE GOOD SOIL ARE THE ONES WHO HEAR THE WORD AND ACCEPT IT AND BEAR FRUIT THIRTYFOLD AND SIXTYFOLD AND A HUNDREDFOLD

 AND HE SAID TO THEM IS A LAMP BROUGHT IN TO BE PUT UNDER A BASKET OR UNDER A BED AND NOT ON A STAND

FOR NOTHING IS HIDDEN EXCEPT TO BE MADE MANIFEST; NOR IS ANYTHING SECRET EXCEPT TO COME TO LIGHT

IF ANYONE HAS EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR

 AND HE SAID TO THEM PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU HEAR WITH THE MEASURE YOU USE IT WILL BE MEASURED TO YOU AND STILL MORE WILL BE ADDED TO YOU

FOR TO THE ONE WHO HAS MORE WILL BE GIVEN AND FROM THE ONE WHO HAS NOT EVEN WHAT HE HAS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY

 AND HE SAID THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AS IF A MAN SHOULD SCATTER SEED ON THE GROUND

HE SLEEPS AND RISES NIGHT AND DAY AND THE SEED SPROUTS AND GROWS; HE KNOWS NOT HOW

THE EARTH PRODUCES BY ITSELF FIRST THE BLADE THEN THE EAR THEN THE FULL GRAIN IN THE EAR

BUT WHEN THE GRAIN IS RIPE AT ONCE HE PUTS IN THE SICKLE BECAUSE THE HARVEST HAS COME

 AND HE SAID WITH WHAT CAN WE COMPARE THE KINGDOM OF GOD OR WHAT PARABLE SHALL WE USE FOR IT

IT IS LIKE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED WHICH WHEN SOWN ON THE GROUND IS THE SMALLEST OF ALL THE SEEDS ON EARTH YET WHEN IT IS SOWN IT GROWS UP AND BECOMES LARGER THAN ALL THE GARDEN PLANTS AND PUTS OUT LARGE BRANCHES SO THAT THE BIRDS OF THE AIR CAN MAKE NESTS IN ITS SHADE

 WITH MANY SUCH PARABLES HE SPOKE THE WORD TO THEM AS THEY WERE ABLE TO HEAR IT

HE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM WITHOUT A PARABLE BUT PRIVATELY TO HIS OWN DISCIPLES HE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING

ON THAT DAY WHEN EVENING HAD COME HE SAID TO THEM LET US GO ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE

 AND LEAVING THE CROWD THEY TOOK HIM WITH THEM IN THE BOAT JUST AS HE WAS

AND OTHER BOATS WERE WITH HIM

AND A GREAT WINDSTORM AROSE AND THE WAVES WERE BREAKING INTO THE BOAT SO THAT THE BOAT WAS ALREADY FILLING

BUT HE WAS IN THE STERN ASLEEP ON THE CUSHION

AND THEY WOKE HIM AND SAID TO HIM TEACHER DO YOU NOT CARE THAT WE ARE PERISHING

 AND HE AWOKE AND REBUKED THE WIND AND SAID TO THE SEA PEACE

BE STILL

 AND THE WIND CEASED AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM

HE SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID

HAVE YOU STILL NO FAITH

 AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH GREAT FEAR AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHO THEN IS THIS THAT EVEN WIND AND SEA OBEY HIM

THEY CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GERASENES

AND WHEN JESUS HAD STEPPED OUT OF THE BOAT IMMEDIATELY THERE MET HIM OUT OF THE TOMBS A MAN WITH AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT

HE LIVED AMONG THE TOMBS

AND NO ONE COULD BIND HIM ANYMORE NOT EVEN WITH A CHAIN FOR HE HAD OFTEN BEEN BOUND WITH SHACKLES AND CHAINS BUT HE WRENCHED THE CHAINS APART AND HE BROKE THE SHACKLES IN PIECES

NO ONE HAD THE STRENGTH TO SUBDUE HIM

NIGHT AND DAY AMONG THE TOMBS AND ON THE MOUNTAINS HE WAS ALWAYS CRYING OUT AND BRUISING HIMSELF WITH STONES

AND WHEN HE SAW JESUS FROM AFAR HE RAN AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM

AND CRYING OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE HE SAID WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH ME JESUS SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD

I ADJURE YOU BY GOD DO NOT TORMENT ME

 FOR HE WAS SAYING TO HIM COME OUT OF THE MAN YOU UNCLEAN SPIRIT

 AND JESUS ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR NAME

 HE REPLIED MY NAME IS LEGION FOR WE ARE MANY

 AND HE BEGGED HIM EARNESTLY NOT TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY

NOW A GREAT HERD OF PIGS WAS FEEDING THERE ON THE HILLSIDE AND THEY BEGGED HIM SAYING SEND US TO THE PIGS; LET US ENTER THEM

 SO HE GAVE THEM PERMISSION

AND THE UNCLEAN SPIRITS CAME OUT AND ENTERED THE PIGS AND THE HERD NUMBERING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND RUSHED DOWN THE STEEP BANK INTO THE SEA AND WERE DROWNED IN THE SEA

THE HERDSMEN FLED AND TOLD IT IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY

AND PEOPLE CAME TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT HAD HAPPENED

AND THEY CAME TO JESUS AND SAW THE DEMONPOSSESSED MAN THE ONE WHO HAD HAD THE LEGION SITTING THERE CLOTHED AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND AND THEY WERE AFRAID

AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN IT DESCRIBED TO THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE DEMONPOSSESSED MAN AND TO THE PIGS

AND THEY BEGAN TO BEG JESUS TO DEPART FROM THEIR REGION

AS HE WAS GETTING INTO THE BOAT THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN POSSESSED WITH DEMONS BEGGED HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE WITH HIM

AND HE DID NOT PERMIT HIM BUT SAID TO HIM GO HOME TO YOUR FRIENDS AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH THE LORD HAS DONE FOR YOU AND HOW HE HAS HAD MERCY ON YOU

 AND HE WENT AWAY AND BEGAN TO PROCLAIM IN THE DECAPOLIS HOW MUCH JESUS HAD DONE FOR HIM AND EVERYONE MARVELED

AND WHEN JESUS HAD CROSSED AGAIN IN THE BOAT TO THE OTHER SIDE A GREAT CROWD GATHERED ABOUT HIM AND HE WAS BESIDE THE SEA

THEN CAME ONE OF THE RULERS OF THE SYNAGOGUE JAIRUS BY NAME AND SEEING HIM HE FELL AT HIS FEET AND IMPLORED HIM EARNESTLY SAYING MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS AT THE POINT OF DEATH

COME AND LAY YOUR HANDS ON HER SO THAT SHE MAY BE MADE WELL AND LIVE

 AND HE WENT WITH HIM

AND A GREAT CROWD FOLLOWED HIM AND THRONGED ABOUT HIM

AND THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR TWELVE YEARS AND WHO HAD SUFFERED MUCH UNDER MANY PHYSICIANS AND HAD SPENT ALL THAT SHE HAD AND WAS NO BETTER BUT RATHER GREW WORSE

SHE HAD HEARD THE REPORTS ABOUT JESUS AND CAME UP BEHIND HIM IN THE CROWD AND TOUCHED HIS GARMENT

FOR SHE SAID IF I TOUCH EVEN HIS GARMENTS I WILL BE MADE WELL

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE FLOW OF BLOOD DRIED UP AND SHE FELT IN HER BODY THAT SHE WAS HEALED OF HER DISEASE

AND JESUS PERCEIVING IN HIMSELF THAT POWER HAD GONE OUT FROM HIM IMMEDIATELY TURNED ABOUT IN THE CROWD AND SAID WHO TOUCHED MY GARMENTS

 AND HIS DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM YOU SEE THE CROWD PRESSING AROUND YOU AND YET YOU SAY 'WHO TOUCHED ME

' AND HE LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHO HAD DONE IT

BUT THE WOMAN KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER CAME IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM AND TOLD HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH

AND HE SAID TO HER DAUGHTER YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL; GO IN PEACE AND BE HEALED OF YOUR DISEASE

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING THERE CAME FROM THE RULER'S HOUSE SOME WHO SAID YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD

WHY TROUBLE THE TEACHER ANY FURTHER

 BUT OVERHEARING WHAT THEY SAID JESUS SAID TO THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE DO NOT FEAR ONLY BELIEVE

 AND HE ALLOWED NO ONE TO FOLLOW HIM EXCEPT PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN THE BROTHER OF JAMES

THEY CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE AND JESUS SAW A COMMOTION PEOPLE WEEPING AND WAILING LOUDLY

AND WHEN HE HAD ENTERED HE SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU MAKING A COMMOTION AND WEEPING

THE CHILD IS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPING

 AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM

BUT HE PUT THEM ALL OUTSIDE AND TOOK THE CHILD'S FATHER AND MOTHER AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND WENT IN WHERE THE CHILD WAS

TAKING HER BY THE HAND HE SAID TO HER TALITHA CUMI WHICH MEANS LITTLE GIRL I SAY TO YOU ARISE

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE GIRL GOT UP AND BEGAN WALKING FOR SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY OVERCOME WITH AMAZEMENT

AND HE STRICTLY CHARGED THEM THAT NO ONE SHOULD KNOW THIS AND TOLD THEM TO GIVE HER SOMETHING TO EAT

HE WENT AWAY FROM THERE AND CAME TO HIS HOMETOWN AND HIS DISCIPLES FOLLOWED HIM

AND ON THE SABBATH HE BEGAN TO TEACH IN THE SYNAGOGUE AND MANY WHO HEARD HIM WERE ASTONISHED SAYING WHERE DID THIS MAN GET THESE THINGS

WHAT IS THE WISDOM GIVEN TO HIM

HOW ARE SUCH MIGHTY WORKS DONE BY HIS HANDS

IS NOT THIS THE CARPENTER THE SON OF MARY AND BROTHER OF JAMES AND JOSES AND JUDAS AND SIMON

AND ARE NOT HIS SISTERS HERE WITH US

 AND THEY TOOK OFFENSE AT HIM

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM A PROPHET IS NOT WITHOUT HONOR EXCEPT IN HIS HOMETOWN AND AMONG HIS RELATIVES AND IN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD

 AND HE COULD DO NO MIGHTY WORK THERE EXCEPT THAT HE LAID HIS HANDS ON A FEW SICK PEOPLE AND HEALED THEM

AND HE MARVELED BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF

AND HE WENT ABOUT AMONG THE VILLAGES TEACHING

AND HE CALLED THE TWELVE AND BEGAN TO SEND THEM OUT TWO BY TWO AND GAVE THEM AUTHORITY OVER THE UNCLEAN SPIRITS

HE CHARGED THEM TO TAKE NOTHING FOR THEIR JOURNEY EXCEPT A STAFFNO BREAD NO BAG NO MONEY IN THEIR BELTS BUT TO WEAR SANDALS AND NOT PUT ON TWO TUNICS

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHENEVER YOU ENTER A HOUSE STAY THERE UNTIL YOU DEPART FROM THERE

AND IF ANY PLACE WILL NOT RECEIVE YOU AND THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE SHAKE OFF THE DUST THAT IS ON YOUR FEET AS A TESTIMONY AGAINST THEM

 SO THEY WENT OUT AND PROCLAIMED THAT PEOPLE SHOULD REPENT

AND THEY CAST OUT MANY DEMONS AND ANOINTED WITH OIL MANY WHO WERE SICK AND HEALED THEM

KING HEROD HEARD OF IT FOR JESUS' NAME HAD BECOME KNOWN

SOME SAID JOHN THE BAPTIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD

THAT IS WHY THESE MIRACULOUS POWERS ARE AT WORK IN HIM

 BUT OTHERS SAID HE IS ELIJAH

 AND OTHERS SAID HE IS A PROPHET LIKE ONE OF THE PROPHETS OF OLD

 BUT WHEN HEROD HEARD OF IT HE SAID JOHN WHOM I BEHEADED HAS BEEN RAISED

 FOR IT WAS HEROD WHO HAD SENT AND SEIZED JOHN AND BOUND HIM IN PRISON FOR THE SAKE OF HERODIAS HIS BROTHER PHILIP'S WIFE BECAUSE HE HAD MARRIED HER

FOR JOHN HAD BEEN SAYING TO HEROD IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE

 AND HERODIAS HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM AND WANTED TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

BUT SHE COULD NOT FOR HEROD FEARED JOHN KNOWING THAT HE WAS A RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY MAN AND HE KEPT HIM SAFE

WHEN HE HEARD HIM HE WAS GREATLY PERPLEXED AND YET HE HEARD HIM GLADLY

BUT AN OPPORTUNITY CAME WHEN HEROD ON HIS BIRTHDAY GAVE A BANQUET FOR HIS NOBLES AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE LEADING MEN OF GALILEE

FOR WHEN HERODIAS'S DAUGHTER CAME IN AND DANCED SHE PLEASED HEROD AND HIS GUESTS

AND THE KING SAID TO THE GIRL ASK ME FOR WHATEVER YOU WISH AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU

 AND HE VOWED TO HER WHATEVER YOU ASK ME I WILL GIVE YOU UP TO HALF OF MY KINGDOM

 AND SHE WENT OUT AND SAID TO HER MOTHER FOR WHAT SHOULD I ASK

 AND SHE SAID THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST

 AND SHE CAME IN IMMEDIATELY WITH HASTE TO THE KING AND ASKED SAYING I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME AT ONCE THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST ON A PLATTER

 AND THE KING WAS EXCEEDINGLY SORRY BUT BECAUSE OF HIS OATHS AND HIS GUESTS HE DID NOT WANT TO BREAK HIS WORD TO HER

AND IMMEDIATELY THE KING SENT AN EXECUTIONER WITH ORDERS TO BRING JOHN'S HEAD

HE WENT AND BEHEADED HIM IN THE PRISON AND BROUGHT HIS HEAD ON A PLATTER AND GAVE IT TO THE GIRL AND THE GIRL GAVE IT TO HER MOTHER

WHEN HIS DISCIPLES HEARD OF IT THEY CAME AND TOOK HIS BODY AND LAID IT IN A TOMB

THE APOSTLES RETURNED TO JESUS AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE AND TAUGHT

AND HE SAID TO THEM COME AWAY BY YOURSELVES TO A DESOLATE PLACE AND REST A WHILE

 FOR MANY WERE COMING AND GOING AND THEY HAD NO LEISURE EVEN TO EAT

AND THEY WENT AWAY IN THE BOAT TO A DESOLATE PLACE BY THEMSELVES

NOW MANY SAW THEM GOING AND RECOGNIZED THEM AND THEY RAN THERE ON FOOT FROM ALL THE TOWNS AND GOT THERE AHEAD OF THEM

WHEN HE WENT ASHORE HE SAW A GREAT CROWD AND HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE LIKE SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD

AND HE BEGAN TO TEACH THEM MANY THINGS

AND WHEN IT GREW LATE HIS DISCIPLES CAME TO HIM AND SAID THIS IS A DESOLATE PLACE AND THE HOUR IS NOW LATE

SEND THEM AWAY TO GO INTO THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE AND VILLAGES AND BUY THEMSELVES SOMETHING TO EAT

 BUT HE ANSWERED THEM YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM SHALL WE GO AND BUY TWO HUNDRED DENARII WORTH OF BREAD AND GIVE IT TO THEM TO EAT

 AND HE SAID TO THEM HOW MANY LOAVES DO YOU HAVE

GO AND SEE

 AND WHEN THEY HAD FOUND OUT THEY SAID FIVE AND TWO FISH

 THEN HE COMMANDED THEM ALL TO SIT DOWN IN GROUPS ON THE GREEN GRASS

SO THEY SAT DOWN IN GROUPS BY HUNDREDS AND BY FIFTIES

AND TAKING THE FIVE LOAVES AND THE TWO FISH HE LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND SAID A BLESSING AND BROKE THE LOAVES AND GAVE THEM TO THE DISCIPLES TO SET BEFORE THE PEOPLE

AND HE DIVIDED THE TWO FISH AMONG THEM ALL

AND THEY ALL ATE AND WERE SATISFIED

AND THEY TOOK UP TWELVE BASKETS FULL OF BROKEN PIECES AND OF THE FISH

AND THOSE WHO ATE THE LOAVES WERE FIVE THOUSAND MEN

IMMEDIATELY HE MADE HIS DISCIPLES GET INTO THE BOAT AND GO BEFORE HIM TO THE OTHER SIDE TO BETHSAIDA WHILE HE DISMISSED THE CROWD

AND AFTER HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THEM HE WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN TO PRAY

AND WHEN EVENING CAME THE BOAT WAS OUT ON THE SEA AND HE WAS ALONE ON THE LAND

AND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE MAKING HEADWAY PAINFULLY FOR THE WIND WAS AGAINST THEM

AND ABOUT THE FOURTH WATCH OF THE NIGHT HE CAME TO THEM WALKING ON THE SEA

HE MEANT TO PASS BY THEM BUT WHEN THEY SAW HIM WALKING ON THE SEA THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GHOST AND CRIED OUT FOR THEY ALL SAW HIM AND WERE TERRIFIED

BUT IMMEDIATELY HE SPOKE TO THEM AND SAID TAKE HEART; IT IS I

DO NOT BE AFRAID

 AND HE GOT INTO THE BOAT WITH THEM AND THE WIND CEASED

AND THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTOUNDED FOR THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE LOAVES BUT THEIR HEARTS WERE HARDENED

WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED OVER THEY CAME TO LAND AT GENNESARET AND MOORED TO THE SHORE

AND WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF THE BOAT THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED HIM AND RAN ABOUT THE WHOLE REGION AND BEGAN TO BRING THE SICK PEOPLE ON THEIR BEDS TO WHEREVER THEY HEARD HE WAS

AND WHEREVER HE CAME IN VILLAGES CITIES OR COUNTRYSIDE THEY LAID THE SICK IN THE MARKETPLACES AND IMPLORED HIM THAT THEY MIGHT TOUCH EVEN THE FRINGE OF HIS GARMENT

AND AS MANY AS TOUCHED IT WERE MADE WELL

NOW WHEN THE PHARISEES GATHERED TO HIM WITH SOME OF THE SCRIBES WHO HAD COME FROM JERUSALEM THEY SAW THAT SOME OF HIS DISCIPLES ATE WITH HANDS THAT WERE DEFILED THAT IS UNWASHED

FOR THE PHARISEES AND ALL THE JEWS DO NOT EAT UNLESS THEY WASH THEIR HANDS HOLDING TO THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS AND WHEN THEY COME FROM THE MARKETPLACE THEY DO NOT EAT UNLESS THEY WASH

AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER TRADITIONS THAT THEY OBSERVE SUCH AS THE WASHING OF CUPS AND POTS AND COPPER VESSELS AND DINING COUCHES

 AND THE PHARISEES AND THE SCRIBES ASKED HIM WHY DO YOUR DISCIPLES NOT WALK ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS BUT EAT WITH DEFILED HANDS

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WELL DID ISAIAH PROPHESY OF YOU HYPOCRITES AS IT IS WRITTEN 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM ME; IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN

' YOU LEAVE THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD AND HOLD TO THE TRADITION OF MEN

 AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE A FINE WAY OF REJECTING THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOUR TRADITION

FOR MOSES SAID 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; AND 'WHOEVER REVILES FATHER OR MOTHER MUST SURELY DIE

' BUT YOU SAY 'IF A MAN TELLS HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER WHATEVER YOU WOULD HAVE GAINED FROM ME IS CORBAN' THAT IS GIVEN TO GOD THEN YOU NO LONGER PERMIT HIM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS FATHER OR MOTHER THUS MAKING VOID THE WORD OF GOD BY YOUR TRADITION THAT YOU HAVE HANDED DOWN

AND MANY SUCH THINGS YOU DO

 AND HE CALLED THE PEOPLE TO HIM AGAIN AND SAID TO THEM HEAR ME ALL OF YOU AND UNDERSTAND THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE A PERSON THAT BY GOING INTO HIM CAN DEFILE HIM BUT THE THINGS THAT COME OUT OF A PERSON ARE WHAT DEFILE HIM

 SEE FOOTNOTE AND WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE AND LEFT THE PEOPLE HIS DISCIPLES ASKED HIM ABOUT THE PARABLE

AND HE SAID TO THEM THEN ARE YOU ALSO WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

DO YOU NOT SEE THAT WHATEVER GOES INTO A PERSON FROM OUTSIDE CANNOT DEFILE HIM SINCE IT ENTERS NOT HIS HEART BUT HIS STOMACH AND IS EXPELLED

 THUS HE DECLARED ALL FOODS CLEAN

 AND HE SAID WHAT COMES OUT OF A PERSON IS WHAT DEFILES HIM

FOR FROM WITHIN OUT OF THE HEART OF MAN COME EVIL THOUGHTS SEXUAL IMMORALITY THEFT MURDER ADULTERY COVETING WICKEDNESS DECEIT SENSUALITY ENVY SLANDER PRIDE FOOLISHNESS

ALL THESE EVIL THINGS COME FROM WITHIN AND THEY DEFILE A PERSON

 AND FROM THERE HE AROSE AND WENT AWAY TO THE REGION OF TYRE AND SIDON

AND HE ENTERED A HOUSE AND DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO KNOW YET HE COULD NOT BE HIDDEN

BUT IMMEDIATELY A WOMAN WHOSE LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS POSSESSED BY AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT HEARD OF HIM AND CAME AND FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET

NOW THE WOMAN WAS A GENTILE A SYROPHOENICIAN BY BIRTH

AND SHE BEGGED HIM TO CAST THE DEMON OUT OF HER DAUGHTER

AND HE SAID TO HER LET THE CHILDREN BE FED FIRST FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND THROW IT TO THE DOGS

 BUT SHE ANSWERED HIM YES LORD; YET EVEN THE DOGS UNDER THE TABLE EAT THE CHILDREN'S CRUMBS

 AND HE SAID TO HER FOR THIS STATEMENT YOU MAY GO YOUR WAY; THE DEMON HAS LEFT YOUR DAUGHTER

 AND SHE WENT HOME AND FOUND THE CHILD LYING IN BED AND THE DEMON GONE

THEN HE RETURNED FROM THE REGION OF TYRE AND WENT THROUGH SIDON TO THE SEA OF GALILEE IN THE REGION OF THE DECAPOLIS

AND THEY BROUGHT TO HIM A MAN WHO WAS DEAF AND HAD A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT AND THEY BEGGED HIM TO LAY HIS HAND ON HIM

AND TAKING HIM ASIDE FROM THE CROWD PRIVATELY HE PUT HIS FINGERS INTO HIS EARS AND AFTER SPITTING TOUCHED HIS TONGUE

AND LOOKING UP TO HEAVEN HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIM EPHPHATHA THAT IS BE OPENED

 AND HIS EARS WERE OPENED HIS TONGUE WAS RELEASED AND HE SPOKE PLAINLY

AND JESUS CHARGED THEM TO TELL NO ONE

BUT THE MORE HE CHARGED THEM THE MORE ZEALOUSLY THEY PROCLAIMED IT

AND THEY WERE ASTONISHED BEYOND MEASURE SAYING HE HAS DONE ALL THINGS WELL

HE EVEN MAKES THE DEAF HEAR AND THE MUTE SPEAK

IN THOSE DAYS WHEN AGAIN A GREAT CROWD HAD GATHERED AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID TO THEM I HAVE COMPASSION ON THE CROWD BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WITH ME NOW THREE DAYS AND HAVE NOTHING TO EAT

AND IF I SEND THEM AWAY HUNGRY TO THEIR HOMES THEY WILL FAINT ON THE WAY

AND SOME OF THEM HAVE COME FROM FAR AWAY

 AND HIS DISCIPLES ANSWERED HIM HOW CAN ONE FEED THESE PEOPLE WITH BREAD HERE IN THIS DESOLATE PLACE

 AND HE ASKED THEM HOW MANY LOAVES DO YOU HAVE

 THEY SAID SEVEN

 AND HE DIRECTED THE CROWD TO SIT DOWN ON THE GROUND

AND HE TOOK THE SEVEN LOAVES AND HAVING GIVEN THANKS HE BROKE THEM AND GAVE THEM TO HIS DISCIPLES TO SET BEFORE THE PEOPLE; AND THEY SET THEM BEFORE THE CROWD

AND THEY HAD A FEW SMALL FISH

AND HAVING BLESSED THEM HE SAID THAT THESE ALSO SHOULD BE SET BEFORE THEM

AND THEY ATE AND WERE SATISFIED

AND THEY TOOK UP THE BROKEN PIECES LEFT OVER SEVEN BASKETS FULL

AND THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE

AND HE SENT THEM AWAY

AND IMMEDIATELY HE GOT INTO THE BOAT WITH HIS DISCIPLES AND WENT TO THE DISTRICT OF DALMANUTHA

THE PHARISEES CAME AND BEGAN TO ARGUE WITH HIM SEEKING FROM HIM A SIGN FROM HEAVEN TO TEST HIM

AND HE SIGHED DEEPLY IN HIS SPIRIT AND SAID WHY DOES THIS GENERATION SEEK A SIGN

TRULY I SAY TO YOU NO SIGN WILL BE GIVEN TO THIS GENERATION

 AND HE LEFT THEM GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE

NOW THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO BRING BREAD AND THEY HAD ONLY ONE LOAF WITH THEM IN THE BOAT

AND HE CAUTIONED THEM SAYING WATCH OUT; BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND THE LEAVEN OF HEROD

 AND THEY BEGAN DISCUSSING WITH ONE ANOTHER THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NO BREAD

AND JESUS AWARE OF THIS SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NO BREAD

DO YOU NOT YET PERCEIVE OR UNDERSTAND

ARE YOUR HEARTS HARDENED

HAVING EYES DO YOU NOT SEE AND HAVING EARS DO YOU NOT HEAR

AND DO YOU NOT REMEMBER

WHEN I BROKE THE FIVE LOAVES FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND HOW MANY BASKETS FULL OF BROKEN PIECES DID YOU TAKE UP

 THEY SAID TO HIM TWELVE

 AND THE SEVEN FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND HOW MANY BASKETS FULL OF BROKEN PIECES DID YOU TAKE UP

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM SEVEN

 AND HE SAID TO THEM DO YOU NOT YET UNDERSTAND

 AND THEY CAME TO BETHSAIDA

AND SOME PEOPLE BROUGHT TO HIM A BLIND MAN AND BEGGED HIM TO TOUCH HIM

AND HE TOOK THE BLIND MAN BY THE HAND AND LED HIM OUT OF THE VILLAGE AND WHEN HE HAD SPIT ON HIS EYES AND LAID HIS HANDS ON HIM HE ASKED HIM DO YOU SEE ANYTHING

 AND HE LOOKED UP AND SAID I SEE MEN BUT THEY LOOK LIKE TREES WALKING

 THEN JESUS LAID HIS HANDS ON HIS EYES AGAIN; AND HE OPENED HIS EYES HIS SIGHT WAS RESTORED AND HE SAW EVERYTHING CLEARLY

AND HE SENT HIM TO HIS HOME SAYING DO NOT EVEN ENTER THE VILLAGE

 AND JESUS WENT ON WITH HIS DISCIPLES TO THE VILLAGES OF CAESAREA PHILIPPI

AND ON THE WAY HE ASKED HIS DISCIPLES WHO DO PEOPLE SAY THAT I AM

 AND THEY TOLD HIM JOHN THE BAPTIST; AND OTHERS SAY ELIJAH; AND OTHERS ONE OF THE PROPHETS

 AND HE ASKED THEM BUT WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM

 PETER ANSWERED HIM YOU ARE THE CHRIST

 AND HE STRICTLY CHARGED THEM TO TELL NO ONE ABOUT HIM

AND HE BEGAN TO TEACH THEM THAT THE SON OF MAN MUST SUFFER MANY THINGS AND BE REJECTED BY THE ELDERS AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES AND BE KILLED AND AFTER THREE DAYS RISE AGAIN

AND HE SAID THIS PLAINLY

AND PETER TOOK HIM ASIDE AND BEGAN TO REBUKE HIM

BUT TURNING AND SEEING HIS DISCIPLES HE REBUKED PETER AND SAID GET BEHIND ME SATAN

FOR YOU ARE NOT SETTING YOUR MIND ON THE THINGS OF GOD BUT ON THE THINGS OF MAN

 AND HE CALLED TO HIM THE CROWD WITH HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID TO THEM IF ANYONE WOULD COME AFTER ME LET HIM DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME

FOR WHOEVER WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE WILL LOSE IT BUT WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE FOR MY SAKE AND THE GOSPEL'S WILL SAVE IT

FOR WHAT DOES IT PROFIT A MAN TO GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD AND FORFEIT HIS LIFE

FOR WHAT CAN A MAN GIVE IN RETURN FOR HIS LIFE

FOR WHOEVER IS ASHAMED OF ME AND OF MY WORDS IN THIS ADULTEROUS AND SINFUL GENERATION OF HIM WILL THE SON OF MAN ALSO BE ASHAMED WHEN HE COMES IN THE GLORY OF HIS FATHER WITH THE HOLY ANGELS

AND HE SAID TO THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU THERE ARE SOME STANDING HERE WHO WILL NOT TASTE DEATH UNTIL THEY SEE THE KINGDOM OF GOD AFTER IT HAS COME WITH POWER

 AND AFTER SIX DAYS JESUS TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN AND LED THEM UP A HIGH MOUNTAIN BY THEMSELVES

AND HE WAS TRANSFIGURED BEFORE THEM AND HIS CLOTHES BECAME RADIANT INTENSELY WHITE AS NO ONE ON EARTH COULD BLEACH THEM

AND THERE APPEARED TO THEM ELIJAH WITH MOSES AND THEY WERE TALKING WITH JESUS

AND PETER SAID TO JESUS RABBI IT IS GOOD THAT WE ARE HERE

LET US MAKE THREE TENTS ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR MOSES AND ONE FOR ELIJAH

 FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY FOR THEY WERE TERRIFIED

AND A CLOUD OVERSHADOWED THEM AND A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE CLOUD THIS IS MY BELOVED SON; LISTEN TO HIM

 AND SUDDENLY LOOKING AROUND THEY NO LONGER SAW ANYONE WITH THEM BUT JESUS ONLY

AND AS THEY WERE COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HE CHARGED THEM TO TELL NO ONE WHAT THEY HAD SEEN UNTIL THE SON OF MAN HAD RISEN FROM THE DEAD

SO THEY KEPT THE MATTER TO THEMSELVES QUESTIONING WHAT THIS RISING FROM THE DEAD MIGHT MEAN

AND THEY ASKED HIM WHY DO THE SCRIBES SAY THAT FIRST ELIJAH MUST COME

 AND HE SAID TO THEM ELIJAH DOES COME FIRST TO RESTORE ALL THINGS

AND HOW IS IT WRITTEN OF THE SON OF MAN THAT HE SHOULD SUFFER MANY THINGS AND BE TREATED WITH CONTEMPT

BUT I TELL YOU THAT ELIJAH HAS COME AND THEY DID TO HIM WHATEVER THEY PLEASED AS IT IS WRITTEN OF HIM

 AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE DISCIPLES THEY SAW A GREAT CROWD AROUND THEM AND SCRIBES ARGUING WITH THEM

AND IMMEDIATELY ALL THE CROWD WHEN THEY SAW HIM WERE GREATLY AMAZED AND RAN UP TO HIM AND GREETED HIM

AND HE ASKED THEM WHAT ARE YOU ARGUING ABOUT WITH THEM

 AND SOMEONE FROM THE CROWD ANSWERED HIM TEACHER I BROUGHT MY SON TO YOU FOR HE HAS A SPIRIT THAT MAKES HIM MUTE

AND WHENEVER IT SEIZES HIM IT THROWS HIM DOWN AND HE FOAMS AND GRINDS HIS TEETH AND BECOMES RIGID

SO I ASKED YOUR DISCIPLES TO CAST IT OUT AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE

 AND HE ANSWERED THEM O FAITHLESS GENERATION HOW LONG AM I TO BE WITH YOU

HOW LONG AM I TO BEAR WITH YOU

BRING HIM TO ME

 AND THEY BROUGHT THE BOY TO HIM

AND WHEN THE SPIRIT SAW HIM IMMEDIATELY IT CONVULSED THE BOY AND HE FELL ON THE GROUND AND ROLLED ABOUT FOAMING AT THE MOUTH

AND JESUS ASKED HIS FATHER HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HAPPENING TO HIM

 AND HE SAID FROM CHILDHOOD

AND IT HAS OFTEN CAST HIM INTO FIRE AND INTO WATER TO DESTROY HIM

BUT IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING HAVE COMPASSION ON US AND HELP US

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM IF YOU CAN

ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE FOR ONE WHO BELIEVES

 IMMEDIATELY THE FATHER OF THE CHILD CRIED OUT AND SAID I BELIEVE; HELP MY UNBELIEF

 AND WHEN JESUS SAW THAT A CROWD CAME RUNNING TOGETHER HE REBUKED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT SAYING TO IT YOU MUTE AND DEAF SPIRIT I COMMAND YOU COME OUT OF HIM AND NEVER ENTER HIM AGAIN

 AND AFTER CRYING OUT AND CONVULSING HIM TERRIBLY IT CAME OUT AND THE BOY WAS LIKE A CORPSE SO THAT MOST OF THEM SAID HE IS DEAD

 BUT JESUS TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND LIFTED HIM UP AND HE AROSE

AND WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE HIS DISCIPLES ASKED HIM PRIVATELY WHY COULD WE NOT CAST IT OUT

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THIS KIND CANNOT BE DRIVEN OUT BY ANYTHING BUT PRAYER

 THEY WENT ON FROM THERE AND PASSED THROUGH GALILEE

AND HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO KNOW FOR HE WAS TEACHING HIS DISCIPLES SAYING TO THEM THE SON OF MAN IS GOING TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF MEN AND THEY WILL KILL HIM

AND WHEN HE IS KILLED AFTER THREE DAYS HE WILL RISE

 BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SAYING AND WERE AFRAID TO ASK HIM

AND THEY CAME TO CAPERNAUM

AND WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOUSE HE ASKED THEM WHAT WERE YOU DISCUSSING ON THE WAY

 BUT THEY KEPT SILENT FOR ON THE WAY THEY HAD ARGUED WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT WHO WAS THE GREATEST

AND HE SAT DOWN AND CALLED THE TWELVE

AND HE SAID TO THEM IF ANYONE WOULD BE FIRST HE MUST BE LAST OF ALL AND SERVANT OF ALL

 AND HE TOOK A CHILD AND PUT HIM IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND TAKING HIM IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO THEM WHOEVER RECEIVES ONE SUCH CHILD IN MY NAME RECEIVES ME AND WHOEVER RECEIVES ME RECEIVES NOT ME BUT HIM WHO SENT ME

 JOHN SAID TO HIM TEACHER WE SAW SOMEONE CASTING OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME AND WE TRIED TO STOP HIM BECAUSE HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING US

 BUT JESUS SAID DO NOT STOP HIM FOR NO ONE WHO DOES A MIGHTY WORK IN MY NAME WILL BE ABLE SOON AFTERWARD TO SPEAK EVIL OF ME

FOR THE ONE WHO IS NOT AGAINST US IS FOR US

FOR TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER GIVES YOU A CUP OF WATER TO DRINK BECAUSE YOU BELONG TO CHRIST WILL BY NO MEANS LOSE HIS REWARD

WHOEVER CAUSES ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES WHO BELIEVE IN ME TO SIN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM IF A GREAT MILLSTONE WERE HUNG AROUND HIS NECK AND HE WERE THROWN INTO THE SEA

AND IF YOUR HAND CAUSES YOU TO SIN CUT IT OFF

IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ENTER LIFE CRIPPLED THAN WITH TWO HANDS TO GO TO HELL TO THE UNQUENCHABLE FIRE

SEE FOOTNOTE AND IF YOUR FOOT CAUSES YOU TO SIN CUT IT OFF

IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ENTER LIFE LAME THAN WITH TWO FEET TO BE THROWN INTO HELL

SEE FOOTNOTE AND IF YOUR EYE CAUSES YOU TO SIN TEAR IT OUT

IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD WITH ONE EYE THAN WITH TWO EYES TO BE THROWN INTO HELL 'WHERE THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED

' FOR EVERYONE WILL BE SALTED WITH FIRE

SALT IS GOOD BUT IF THE SALT HAS LOST ITS SALTINESS HOW WILL YOU MAKE IT SALTY AGAIN

HAVE SALT IN YOURSELVES AND BE AT PEACE WITH ONE ANOTHER

AND HE LEFT THERE AND WENT TO THE REGION OF JUDEA AND BEYOND THE JORDAN AND CROWDS GATHERED TO HIM AGAIN

AND AGAIN AS WAS HIS CUSTOM HE TAUGHT THEM

AND PHARISEES CAME UP AND IN ORDER TO TEST HIM ASKED IS IT LAWFUL FOR A MAN TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE

 HE ANSWERED THEM WHAT DID MOSES COMMAND YOU

 THEY SAID MOSES ALLOWED A MAN TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND TO SEND HER AWAY

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR HARDNESS OF HEART HE WROTE YOU THIS COMMANDMENT

BUT FROM THE BEGINNING OF CREATION 'GOD MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE

' 'THEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND HOLD FAST TO HIS WIFE AND THEY SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH

' SO THEY ARE NO LONGER TWO BUT ONE FLESH

WHAT THEREFORE GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER LET NOT MAN SEPARATE

 AND IN THE HOUSE THE DISCIPLES ASKED HIM AGAIN ABOUT THIS MATTER

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHOEVER DIVORCES HIS WIFE AND MARRIES ANOTHER COMMITS ADULTERY AGAINST HER AND IF SHE DIVORCES HER HUSBAND AND MARRIES ANOTHER SHE COMMITS ADULTERY

 AND THEY WERE BRINGING CHILDREN TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT TOUCH THEM AND THE DISCIPLES REBUKED THEM

BUT WHEN JESUS SAW IT HE WAS INDIGNANT AND SAID TO THEM LET THE CHILDREN COME TO ME; DO NOT HINDER THEM FOR TO SUCH BELONGS THE KINGDOM OF GOD

TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER DOES NOT RECEIVE THE KINGDOM OF GOD LIKE A CHILD SHALL NOT ENTER IT

 AND HE TOOK THEM IN HIS ARMS AND BLESSED THEM LAYING HIS HANDS ON THEM

AND AS HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS JOURNEY A MAN RAN UP AND KNELT BEFORE HIM AND ASKED HIM GOOD TEACHER WHAT MUST I DO TO INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU CALL ME GOOD

NO ONE IS GOOD EXCEPT GOD ALONE

YOU KNOW THE COMMANDMENTS 'DO NOT MURDER DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY DO NOT STEAL DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS DO NOT DEFRAUD HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER

' AND HE SAID TO HIM TEACHER ALL THESE I HAVE KEPT FROM MY YOUTH

 AND JESUS LOOKING AT HIM LOVED HIM AND SAID TO HIM YOU LACK ONE THING GO SELL ALL THAT YOU HAVE AND GIVE TO THE POOR AND YOU WILL HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN; AND COME FOLLOW ME

 DISHEARTENED BY THE SAYING HE WENT AWAY SORROWFUL FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS

AND JESUS LOOKED AROUND AND SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES HOW DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WEALTH TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 AND THE DISCIPLES WERE AMAZED AT HIS WORDS

BUT JESUS SAID TO THEM AGAIN CHILDREN HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO GO THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN FOR A RICH PERSON TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 AND THEY WERE EXCEEDINGLY ASTONISHED AND SAID TO HIM THEN WHO CAN BE SAVED

 JESUS LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WITH MAN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT NOT WITH GOD

FOR ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH GOD

 PETER BEGAN TO SAY TO HIM SEE WE HAVE LEFT EVERYTHING AND FOLLOWED YOU

 JESUS SAID TRULY I SAY TO YOU THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS LEFT HOUSE OR BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR MOTHER OR FATHER OR CHILDREN OR LANDS FOR MY SAKE AND FOR THE GOSPEL WHO WILL NOT RECEIVE A HUNDREDFOLD NOW IN THIS TIME HOUSES AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND MOTHERS AND CHILDREN AND LANDS WITH PERSECUTIONS AND IN THE AGE TO COME ETERNAL LIFE

BUT MANY WHO ARE FIRST WILL BE LAST AND THE LAST FIRST

 AND THEY WERE ON THE ROAD GOING UP TO JERUSALEM AND JESUS WAS WALKING AHEAD OF THEM

AND THEY WERE AMAZED AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED WERE AFRAID

AND TAKING THE TWELVE AGAIN HE BEGAN TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO HIM SAYING SEE WE ARE GOING UP TO JERUSALEM AND THE SON OF MAN WILL BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES AND THEY WILL CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH AND DELIVER HIM OVER TO THE GENTILES

AND THEY WILL MOCK HIM AND SPIT ON HIM AND FLOG HIM AND KILL HIM

AND AFTER THREE DAYS HE WILL RISE

 AND JAMES AND JOHN THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM TEACHER WE WANT YOU TO DO FOR US WHATEVER WE ASK OF YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM GRANT US TO SIT ONE AT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ONE AT YOUR LEFT IN YOUR GLORY

 JESUS SAID TO THEM YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING

ARE YOU ABLE TO DRINK THE CUP THAT I DRINK OR TO BE BAPTIZED WITH THE BAPTISM WITH WHICH I AM BAPTIZED

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM WE ARE ABLE

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM THE CUP THAT I DRINK YOU WILL DRINK AND WITH THE BAPTISM WITH WHICH I AM BAPTIZED YOU WILL BE BAPTIZED BUT TO SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND OR AT MY LEFT IS NOT MINE TO GRANT BUT IT IS FOR THOSE FOR WHOM IT HAS BEEN PREPARED

 AND WHEN THE TEN HEARD IT THEY BEGAN TO BE INDIGNANT AT JAMES AND JOHN

AND JESUS CALLED THEM TO HIM AND SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED RULERS OF THE GENTILES LORD IT OVER THEM AND THEIR GREAT ONES EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER THEM

BUT IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU

BUT WHOEVER WOULD BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT AND WHOEVER WOULD BE FIRST AMONG YOU MUST BE SLAVE OF ALL

FOR EVEN THE SON OF MAN CAME NOT TO BE SERVED BUT TO SERVE AND TO GIVE HIS LIFE AS A RANSOM FOR MANY

 AND THEY CAME TO JERICHO

AND AS HE WAS LEAVING JERICHO WITH HIS DISCIPLES AND A GREAT CROWD BARTIMAEUS A BLIND BEGGAR THE SON OF TIMAEUS WAS SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE

AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT IT WAS JESUS OF NAZARETH HE BEGAN TO CRY OUT AND SAY JESUS SON OF DAVID HAVE MERCY ON ME

 AND MANY REBUKED HIM TELLING HIM TO BE SILENT

BUT HE CRIED OUT ALL THE MORE SON OF DAVID HAVE MERCY ON ME

 AND JESUS STOPPED AND SAID CALL HIM

 AND THEY CALLED THE BLIND MAN SAYING TO HIM TAKE HEART

GET UP; HE IS CALLING YOU

 AND THROWING OFF HIS CLOAK HE SPRANG UP AND CAME TO JESUS

AND JESUS SAID TO HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU

 AND THE BLIND MAN SAID TO HIM RABBI LET ME RECOVER MY SIGHT

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM GO YOUR WAY; YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL

 AND IMMEDIATELY HE RECOVERED HIS SIGHT AND FOLLOWED HIM ON THE WAY

NOW WHEN THEY DREW NEAR TO JERUSALEM TO BETHPHAGE AND BETHANY AT THE MOUNT OF OLIVES JESUS SENT TWO OF HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID TO THEM GO INTO THE VILLAGE IN FRONT OF YOU AND IMMEDIATELY AS YOU ENTER IT YOU WILL FIND A COLT TIED ON WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER SAT

UNTIE IT AND BRING IT

IF ANYONE SAYS TO YOU 'WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS

' SAY 'THE LORD HAS NEED OF IT AND WILL SEND IT BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY

' AND THEY WENT AWAY AND FOUND A COLT TIED AT A DOOR OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AND THEY UNTIED IT

AND SOME OF THOSE STANDING THERE SAID TO THEM WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNTYING THE COLT

 AND THEY TOLD THEM WHAT JESUS HAD SAID AND THEY LET THEM GO

AND THEY BROUGHT THE COLT TO JESUS AND THREW THEIR CLOAKS ON IT AND HE SAT ON IT

AND MANY SPREAD THEIR CLOAKS ON THE ROAD AND OTHERS SPREAD LEAFY BRANCHES THAT THEY HAD CUT FROM THE FIELDS

AND THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED WERE SHOUTING HOSANNA

BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

BLESSED IS THE COMING KINGDOM OF OUR FATHER DAVID

HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST

 AND HE ENTERED JERUSALEM AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE

AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AROUND AT EVERYTHING AS IT WAS ALREADY LATE HE WENT OUT TO BETHANY WITH THE TWELVE

ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THEY CAME FROM BETHANY HE WAS HUNGRY

AND SEEING IN THE DISTANCE A FIG TREE IN LEAF HE WENT TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND ANYTHING ON IT

WHEN HE CAME TO IT HE FOUND NOTHING BUT LEAVES FOR IT WAS NOT THE SEASON FOR FIGS

AND HE SAID TO IT MAY NO ONE EVER EAT FRUIT FROM YOU AGAIN

 AND HIS DISCIPLES HEARD IT

AND THEY CAME TO JERUSALEM

AND HE ENTERED THE TEMPLE AND BEGAN TO DRIVE OUT THOSE WHO SOLD AND THOSE WHO BOUGHT IN THE TEMPLE AND HE OVERTURNED THE TABLES OF THE MONEYCHANGERS AND THE SEATS OF THOSE WHO SOLD PIGEONS

AND HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO CARRY ANYTHING THROUGH THE TEMPLE

AND HE WAS TEACHING THEM AND SAYING TO THEM IS IT NOT WRITTEN 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS'

BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT A DEN OF ROBBERS

 AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES HEARD IT AND WERE SEEKING A WAY TO DESTROY HIM FOR THEY FEARED HIM BECAUSE ALL THE CROWD WAS ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING

AND WHEN EVENING CAME THEY WENT OUT OF THE CITY

AS THEY PASSED BY IN THE MORNING THEY SAW THE FIG TREE WITHERED AWAY TO ITS ROOTS

AND PETER REMEMBERED AND SAID TO HIM RABBI LOOK

THE FIG TREE THAT YOU CURSED HAS WITHERED

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM HAVE FAITH IN GOD

TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER SAYS TO THIS MOUNTAIN 'BE TAKEN UP AND THROWN INTO THE SEA' AND DOES NOT DOUBT IN HIS HEART BUT BELIEVES THAT WHAT HE SAYS WILL COME TO PASS IT WILL BE DONE FOR HIM

THEREFORE I TELL YOU WHATEVER YOU ASK IN PRAYER BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED IT AND IT WILL BE YOURS

AND WHENEVER YOU STAND PRAYING FORGIVE IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST ANYONE SO THAT YOUR FATHER ALSO WHO IS IN HEAVEN MAY FORGIVE YOU YOUR TRESPASSES

 SEE FOOTNOTE AND THEY CAME AGAIN TO JERUSALEM

AND AS HE WAS WALKING IN THE TEMPLE THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES AND THE ELDERS CAME TO HIM AND THEY SAID TO HIM BY WHAT AUTHORITY ARE YOU DOING THESE THINGS OR WHO GAVE YOU THIS AUTHORITY TO DO THEM

 JESUS SAID TO THEM I WILL ASK YOU ONE QUESTION; ANSWER ME AND I WILL TELL YOU BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DO THESE THINGS

WAS THE BAPTISM OF JOHN FROM HEAVEN OR FROM MAN

ANSWER ME

 AND THEY DISCUSSED IT WITH ONE ANOTHER SAYING IF WE SAY 'FROM HEAVEN' HE WILL SAY 'WHY THEN DID YOU NOT BELIEVE HIM

' BUT SHALL WE SAY 'FROM MAN'

THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE PEOPLE FOR THEY ALL HELD THAT JOHN REALLY WAS A PROPHET

SO THEY ANSWERED JESUS WE DO NOT KNOW

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM NEITHER WILL I TELL YOU BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DO THESE THINGS

AND HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THEM IN PARABLES

A MAN PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A FENCE AROUND IT AND DUG A PIT FOR THE WINEPRESS AND BUILT A TOWER AND LEASED IT TO TENANTS AND WENT INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY

WHEN THE SEASON CAME HE SENT A SERVANT TO THE TENANTS TO GET FROM THEM SOME OF THE FRUIT OF THE VINEYARD

AND THEY TOOK HIM AND BEAT HIM AND SENT HIM AWAY EMPTYHANDED

AGAIN HE SENT TO THEM ANOTHER SERVANT AND THEY STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD AND TREATED HIM SHAMEFULLY

AND HE SENT ANOTHER AND HIM THEY KILLED

AND SO WITH MANY OTHERS SOME THEY BEAT AND SOME THEY KILLED

HE HAD STILL ONE OTHER A BELOVED SON

FINALLY HE SENT HIM TO THEM SAYING 'THEY WILL RESPECT MY SON

' BUT THOSE TENANTS SAID TO ONE ANOTHER 'THIS IS THE HEIR

COME LET US KILL HIM AND THE INHERITANCE WILL BE OURS

' AND THEY TOOK HIM AND KILLED HIM AND THREW HIM OUT OF THE VINEYARD

WHAT WILL THE OWNER OF THE VINEYARD DO

HE WILL COME AND DESTROY THE TENANTS AND GIVE THE VINEYARD TO OTHERS

HAVE YOU NOT READ THIS SCRIPTURE 'THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE; THIS WAS THE LORD'S DOING AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'

 AND THEY WERE SEEKING TO ARREST HIM BUT FEARED THE PEOPLE FOR THEY PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD TOLD THE PARABLE AGAINST THEM

SO THEY LEFT HIM AND WENT AWAY

AND THEY SENT TO HIM SOME OF THE PHARISEES AND SOME OF THE HERODIANS TO TRAP HIM IN HIS TALK

AND THEY CAME AND SAID TO HIM TEACHER WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE TRUE AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE'S OPINION

FOR YOU ARE NOT SWAYED BY APPEARANCES BUT TRULY TEACH THE WAY OF GOD

IS IT LAWFUL TO PAY TAXES TO CAESAR OR NOT

SHOULD WE PAY THEM OR SHOULD WE NOT

 BUT KNOWING THEIR HYPOCRISY HE SAID TO THEM WHY PUT ME TO THE TEST

BRING ME A DENARIUS AND LET ME LOOK AT IT

 AND THEY BROUGHT ONE

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHOSE LIKENESS AND INSCRIPTION IS THIS

 THEY SAID TO HIM CAESAR'S

 JESUS SAID TO THEM RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD'S

 AND THEY MARVELED AT HIM

AND SADDUCEES CAME TO HIM WHO SAY THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION

AND THEY ASKED HIM A QUESTION SAYING TEACHER MOSES WROTE FOR US THAT IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES AND LEAVES A WIFE BUT LEAVES NO CHILD THE MAN MUST TAKE THE WIDOW AND RAISE UP OFFSPRING FOR HIS BROTHER

THERE WERE SEVEN BROTHERS; THE FIRST TOOK A WIFE AND WHEN HE DIED LEFT NO OFFSPRING

AND THE SECOND TOOK HER AND DIED LEAVING NO OFFSPRING

AND THE THIRD LIKEWISE

AND THE SEVEN LEFT NO OFFSPRING

LAST OF ALL THE WOMAN ALSO DIED

IN THE RESURRECTION WHEN THEY RISE AGAIN WHOSE WIFE WILL SHE BE

FOR THE SEVEN HAD HER AS WIFE

 JESUS SAID TO THEM IS THIS NOT THE REASON YOU ARE WRONG BECAUSE YOU KNOW NEITHER THE SCRIPTURES NOR THE POWER OF GOD

FOR WHEN THEY RISE FROM THE DEAD THEY NEITHER MARRY NOR ARE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE BUT ARE LIKE ANGELS IN HEAVEN

AND AS FOR THE DEAD BEING RAISED HAVE YOU NOT READ IN THE BOOK OF MOSES IN THE PASSAGE ABOUT THE BUSH HOW GOD SPOKE TO HIM SAYING 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB'

HE IS NOT GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING

YOU ARE QUITE WRONG

 AND ONE OF THE SCRIBES CAME UP AND HEARD THEM DISPUTING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SEEING THAT HE ANSWERED THEM WELL ASKED HIM WHICH COMMANDMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL

 JESUS ANSWERED THE MOST IMPORTANT IS 'HEAR O ISRAEL THE LORD OUR GOD THE LORD IS ONE

AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH

' THE SECOND IS THIS 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

' THERE IS NO OTHER COMMANDMENT GREATER THAN THESE

 AND THE SCRIBE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE RIGHT TEACHER

YOU HAVE TRULY SAID THAT HE IS ONE AND THERE IS NO OTHER BESIDES HIM

AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH AND TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBOR AS ONESELF IS MUCH MORE THAN ALL WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES

 AND WHEN JESUS SAW THAT HE ANSWERED WISELY HE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE NOT FAR FROM THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 AND AFTER THAT NO ONE DARED TO ASK HIM ANY MORE QUESTIONS

AND AS JESUS TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE HE SAID HOW CAN THE SCRIBES SAY THAT THE CHRIST IS THE SON OF DAVID

DAVID HIMSELF IN THE HOLY SPIRIT DECLARED 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES UNDER YOUR FEET

' DAVID HIMSELF CALLS HIM LORD

SO HOW IS HE HIS SON

 AND THE GREAT THRONG HEARD HIM GLADLY

AND IN HIS TEACHING HE SAID BEWARE OF THE SCRIBES WHO LIKE TO WALK AROUND IN LONG ROBES AND LIKE GREETINGS IN THE MARKETPLACES AND HAVE THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND THE PLACES OF HONOR AT FEASTS WHO DEVOUR WIDOWS' HOUSES AND FOR A PRETENSE MAKE LONG PRAYERS

THEY WILL RECEIVE THE GREATER CONDEMNATION

 AND HE SAT DOWN OPPOSITE THE TREASURY AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE PUTTING MONEY INTO THE OFFERING BOX

MANY RICH PEOPLE PUT IN LARGE SUMS

AND A POOR WIDOW CAME AND PUT IN TWO SMALL COPPER COINS WHICH MAKE A PENNY

AND HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID TO THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS PUT IN MORE THAN ALL THOSE WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE OFFERING BOX

FOR THEY ALL CONTRIBUTED OUT OF THEIR ABUNDANCE BUT SHE OUT OF HER POVERTY HAS PUT IN EVERYTHING SHE HAD ALL SHE HAD TO LIVE ON

AND AS HE CAME OUT OF THE TEMPLE ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM LOOK TEACHER WHAT WONDERFUL STONES AND WHAT WONDERFUL BUILDINGS

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM DO YOU SEE THESE GREAT BUILDINGS

THERE WILL NOT BE LEFT HERE ONE STONE UPON ANOTHER THAT WILL NOT BE THROWN DOWN

 AND AS HE SAT ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES OPPOSITE THE TEMPLE PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN AND ANDREW ASKED HIM PRIVATELY TELL US WHEN WILL THESE THINGS BE AND WHAT WILL BE THE SIGN WHEN ALL THESE THINGS ARE ABOUT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED

 AND JESUS BEGAN TO SAY TO THEM SEE THAT NO ONE LEADS YOU ASTRAY

MANY WILL COME IN MY NAME SAYING 'I AM HE

' AND THEY WILL LEAD MANY ASTRAY

AND WHEN YOU HEAR OF WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS DO NOT BE ALARMED

THIS MUST TAKE PLACE BUT THE END IS NOT YET

FOR NATION WILL RISE AGAINST NATION AND KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM

THERE WILL BE EARTHQUAKES IN VARIOUS PLACES; THERE WILL BE FAMINES

THESE ARE BUT THE BEGINNING OF THE BIRTH PAINS

BUT BE ON YOUR GUARD

FOR THEY WILL DELIVER YOU OVER TO COUNCILS AND YOU WILL BE BEATEN IN SYNAGOGUES AND YOU WILL STAND BEFORE GOVERNORS AND KINGS FOR MY SAKE TO BEAR WITNESS BEFORE THEM

AND THE GOSPEL MUST FIRST BE PROCLAIMED TO ALL NATIONS

AND WHEN THEY BRING YOU TO TRIAL AND DELIVER YOU OVER DO NOT BE ANXIOUS BEFOREHAND WHAT YOU ARE TO SAY BUT SAY WHATEVER IS GIVEN YOU IN THAT HOUR FOR IT IS NOT YOU WHO SPEAK BUT THE HOLY SPIRIT

AND BROTHER WILL DELIVER BROTHER OVER TO DEATH AND THE FATHER HIS CHILD AND CHILDREN WILL RISE AGAINST PARENTS AND HAVE THEM PUT TO DEATH

AND YOU WILL BE HATED BY ALL FOR MY NAME'S SAKE

BUT THE ONE WHO ENDURES TO THE END WILL BE SAVED

BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION STANDING WHERE IT OUGHT NOT TO BE LET THE READER UNDERSTAND THEN LET THOSE WHO ARE IN JUDEA FLEE TO THE MOUNTAINS

LET THE ONE WHO IS ON THE HOUSETOP NOT GO DOWN NOR ENTER HIS HOUSE TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT AND LET THE ONE WHO IS IN THE FIELD NOT TURN BACK TO TAKE HIS CLOAK

AND ALAS FOR WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NURSING INFANTS IN THOSE DAYS

PRAY THAT IT MAY NOT HAPPEN IN WINTER

FOR IN THOSE DAYS THERE WILL BE SUCH TRIBULATION AS HAS NOT BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION THAT GOD CREATED UNTIL NOW AND NEVER WILL BE

AND IF THE LORD HAD NOT CUT SHORT THE DAYS NO HUMAN BEING WOULD BE SAVED

BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ELECT WHOM HE CHOSE HE SHORTENED THE DAYS

AND THEN IF ANYONE SAYS TO YOU 'LOOK HERE IS THE CHRIST

' OR 'LOOK THERE HE IS

' DO NOT BELIEVE IT

FALSE CHRISTS AND FALSE PROPHETS WILL ARISE AND PERFORM SIGNS AND WONDERS TO LEAD ASTRAY IF POSSIBLE THE ELECT

BUT BE ON GUARD; I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THINGS BEFOREHAND

BUT IN THOSE DAYS AFTER THAT TRIBULATION THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING FROM HEAVEN AND THE POWERS IN THE HEAVENS WILL BE SHAKEN

AND THEN THEY WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS WITH GREAT POWER AND GLORY

AND THEN HE WILL SEND OUT THE ANGELS AND GATHER HIS ELECT FROM THE FOUR WINDS FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO THE ENDS OF HEAVEN

FROM THE FIG TREE LEARN ITS LESSON AS SOON AS ITS BRANCH BECOMES TENDER AND PUTS OUT ITS LEAVES YOU KNOW THAT SUMMER IS NEAR

SO ALSO WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE YOU KNOW THAT HE IS NEAR AT THE VERY GATES

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THIS GENERATION WILL NOT PASS AWAY UNTIL ALL THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE

HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY BUT MY WORDS WILL NOT PASS AWAY

BUT CONCERNING THAT DAY OR THAT HOUR NO ONE KNOWS NOT EVEN THE ANGELS IN HEAVEN NOR THE SON BUT ONLY THE FATHER

BE ON GUARD KEEP AWAKE

FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE TIME WILL COME

IT IS LIKE A MAN GOING ON A JOURNEY WHEN HE LEAVES HOME AND PUTS HIS SERVANTS IN CHARGE EACH WITH HIS WORK AND COMMANDS THE DOORKEEPER TO STAY AWAKE

THEREFORE STAY AWAKEFOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WILL COME IN THE EVENING OR AT MIDNIGHT OR WHEN THE COCK CROWS OR IN THE MORNING LEST HE COME SUDDENLY AND FIND YOU ASLEEP

AND WHAT I SAY TO YOU I SAY TO ALL STAY AWAKE

IT WAS NOW TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PASSOVER AND THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD

AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES WERE SEEKING HOW TO ARREST HIM BY STEALTH AND KILL HIM FOR THEY SAID NOT DURING THE FEAST LEST THERE BE AN UPROAR FROM THE PEOPLE

 AND WHILE HE WAS AT BETHANY IN THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE LEPER AS HE WAS RECLINING AT TABLE A WOMAN CAME WITH AN ALABASTER FLASK OF OINTMENT OF PURE NARD VERY COSTLY AND SHE BROKE THE FLASK AND POURED IT OVER HIS HEAD

THERE WERE SOME WHO SAID TO THEMSELVES INDIGNANTLY WHY WAS THE OINTMENT WASTED LIKE THAT

FOR THIS OINTMENT COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED DENARII AND GIVEN TO THE POOR

 AND THEY SCOLDED HER

BUT JESUS SAID LEAVE HER ALONE

WHY DO YOU TROUBLE HER

SHE HAS DONE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO ME

FOR YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE POOR WITH YOU AND WHENEVER YOU WANT YOU CAN DO GOOD FOR THEM

BUT YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS HAVE ME

SHE HAS DONE WHAT SHE COULD; SHE HAS ANOINTED MY BODY BEFOREHAND FOR BURIAL

AND TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHEREVER THE GOSPEL IS PROCLAIMED IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHAT SHE HAS DONE WILL BE TOLD IN MEMORY OF HER

 THEN JUDAS ISCARIOT WHO WAS ONE OF THE TWELVE WENT TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS IN ORDER TO BETRAY HIM TO THEM

AND WHEN THEY HEARD IT THEY WERE GLAD AND PROMISED TO GIVE HIM MONEY

AND HE SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETRAY HIM

AND ON THE FIRST DAY OF UNLEAVENED BREAD WHEN THEY SACRIFICED THE PASSOVER LAMB HIS DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM WHERE WILL YOU HAVE US GO AND PREPARE FOR YOU TO EAT THE PASSOVER

 AND HE SENT TWO OF HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID TO THEM GO INTO THE CITY AND A MAN CARRYING A JAR OF WATER WILL MEET YOU

FOLLOW HIM AND WHEREVER HE ENTERS SAY TO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE 'THE TEACHER SAYS WHERE IS MY GUEST ROOM WHERE I MAY EAT THE PASSOVER WITH MY DISCIPLES

' AND HE WILL SHOW YOU A LARGE UPPER ROOM FURNISHED AND READY; THERE PREPARE FOR US

 AND THE DISCIPLES SET OUT AND WENT TO THE CITY AND FOUND IT JUST AS HE HAD TOLD THEM AND THEY PREPARED THE PASSOVER

AND WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE CAME WITH THE TWELVE

AND AS THEY WERE RECLINING AT TABLE AND EATING JESUS SAID TRULY I SAY TO YOU ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME ONE WHO IS EATING WITH ME

 THEY BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND TO SAY TO HIM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IS IT I

 HE SAID TO THEM IT IS ONE OF THE TWELVE ONE WHO IS DIPPING BREAD INTO THE DISH WITH ME

FOR THE SON OF MAN GOES AS IT IS WRITTEN OF HIM BUT WOE TO THAT MAN BY WHOM THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THAT MAN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN BORN

 AND AS THEY WERE EATING HE TOOK BREAD AND AFTER BLESSING IT BROKE IT AND GAVE IT TO THEM AND SAID TAKE; THIS IS MY BODY

 AND HE TOOK A CUP AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE GAVE IT TO THEM AND THEY ALL DRANK OF IT

AND HE SAID TO THEM THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH IS POURED OUT FOR MANY

TRULY I SAY TO YOU I WILL NOT DRINK AGAIN OF THE FRUIT OF THE VINE UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN I DRINK IT NEW IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG A HYMN THEY WENT OUT TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM YOU WILL ALL FALL AWAY FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'I WILL STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL BE SCATTERED

' BUT AFTER I AM RAISED UP I WILL GO BEFORE YOU TO GALILEE

 PETER SAID TO HIM EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL FALL AWAY I WILL NOT

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM TRULY I TELL YOU THIS VERY NIGHT BEFORE THE ROOSTER CROWS TWICE YOU WILL DENY ME THREE TIMES

 BUT HE SAID EMPHATICALLY IF I MUST DIE WITH YOU I WILL NOT DENY YOU

 AND THEY ALL SAID THE SAME

AND THEY WENT TO A PLACE CALLED GETHSEMANE

AND HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES SIT HERE WHILE I PRAY

 AND HE TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN AND BEGAN TO BE GREATLY DISTRESSED AND TROUBLED

AND HE SAID TO THEM MY SOUL IS VERY SORROWFUL EVEN TO DEATH

REMAIN HERE AND WATCH

 AND GOING A LITTLE FARTHER HE FELL ON THE GROUND AND PRAYED THAT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THE HOUR MIGHT PASS FROM HIM

AND HE SAID ABBA FATHER ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE FOR YOU

REMOVE THIS CUP FROM ME

YET NOT WHAT I WILL BUT WHAT YOU WILL

 AND HE CAME AND FOUND THEM SLEEPING AND HE SAID TO PETER SIMON ARE YOU ASLEEP

COULD YOU NOT WATCH ONE HOUR

WATCH AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY NOT ENTER INTO TEMPTATION

THE SPIRIT INDEED IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK

 AND AGAIN HE WENT AWAY AND PRAYED SAYING THE SAME WORDS

AND AGAIN HE CAME AND FOUND THEM SLEEPING FOR THEIR EYES WERE VERY HEAVY AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER HIM

AND HE CAME THE THIRD TIME AND SAID TO THEM ARE YOU STILL SLEEPING AND TAKING YOUR REST

IT IS ENOUGH; THE HOUR HAS COME

THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF SINNERS

RISE LET US BE GOING; SEE MY BETRAYER IS AT HAND

 AND IMMEDIATELY WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING JUDAS CAME ONE OF THE TWELVE AND WITH HIM A CROWD WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES AND THE ELDERS

NOW THE BETRAYER HAD GIVEN THEM A SIGN SAYING THE ONE I WILL KISS IS THE MAN

SEIZE HIM AND LEAD HIM AWAY UNDER GUARD

 AND WHEN HE CAME HE WENT UP TO HIM AT ONCE AND SAID RABBI

 AND HE KISSED HIM

AND THEY LAID HANDS ON HIM AND SEIZED HIM

BUT ONE OF THOSE WHO STOOD BY DREW HIS SWORD AND STRUCK THE SERVANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST AND CUT OFF HIS EAR

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU COME OUT AS AGAINST A ROBBER WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS TO CAPTURE ME

DAY AFTER DAY I WAS WITH YOU IN THE TEMPLE TEACHING AND YOU DID NOT SEIZE ME

BUT LET THE SCRIPTURES BE FULFILLED

 AND THEY ALL LEFT HIM AND FLED

AND A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED HIM WITH NOTHING BUT A LINEN CLOTH ABOUT HIS BODY

AND THEY SEIZED HIM BUT HE LEFT THE LINEN CLOTH AND RAN AWAY NAKED

AND THEY LED JESUS TO THE HIGH PRIEST

AND ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS AND THE SCRIBES CAME TOGETHER

AND PETER HAD FOLLOWED HIM AT A DISTANCE RIGHT INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE HIGH PRIEST

AND HE WAS SITTING WITH THE GUARDS AND WARMING HIMSELF AT THE FIRE

NOW THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE WHOLE COUNCIL WERE SEEKING TESTIMONY AGAINST JESUS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BUT THEY FOUND NONE

FOR MANY BORE FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HIM BUT THEIR TESTIMONY DID NOT AGREE

AND SOME STOOD UP AND BORE FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HIM SAYING WE HEARD HIM SAY 'I WILL DESTROY THIS TEMPLE THAT IS MADE WITH HANDS AND IN THREE DAYS I WILL BUILD ANOTHER NOT MADE WITH HANDS

' YET EVEN ABOUT THIS THEIR TESTIMONY DID NOT AGREE

AND THE HIGH PRIEST STOOD UP IN THE MIDST AND ASKED JESUS HAVE YOU NO ANSWER TO MAKE

WHAT IS IT THAT THESE MEN TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

 BUT HE REMAINED SILENT AND MADE NO ANSWER

AGAIN THE HIGH PRIEST ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE CHRIST THE SON OF THE BLESSED

 AND JESUS SAID I AM AND YOU WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER AND COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN

 AND THE HIGH PRIEST TORE HIS GARMENTS AND SAID WHAT FURTHER WITNESSES DO WE NEED

YOU HAVE HEARD HIS BLASPHEMY

WHAT IS YOUR DECISION

 AND THEY ALL CONDEMNED HIM AS DESERVING DEATH

AND SOME BEGAN TO SPIT ON HIM AND TO COVER HIS FACE AND TO STRIKE HIM SAYING TO HIM PROPHESY

 AND THE GUARDS RECEIVED HIM WITH BLOWS

AND AS PETER WAS BELOW IN THE COURTYARD ONE OF THE SERVANT GIRLS OF THE HIGH PRIEST CAME AND SEEING PETER WARMING HIMSELF SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID YOU ALSO WERE WITH THE NAZARENE JESUS

 BUT HE DENIED IT SAYING I NEITHER KNOW NOR UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN

 AND HE WENT OUT INTO THE GATEWAY AND THE ROOSTER CROWED

AND THE SERVANT GIRL SAW HIM AND BEGAN AGAIN TO SAY TO THE BYSTANDERS THIS MAN IS ONE OF THEM

 BUT AGAIN HE DENIED IT

AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE BYSTANDERS AGAIN SAID TO PETER CERTAINLY YOU ARE ONE OF THEM FOR YOU ARE A GALILEAN

 BUT HE BEGAN TO INVOKE A CURSE ON HIMSELF AND TO SWEAR I DO NOT KNOW THIS MAN OF WHOM YOU SPEAK

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE ROOSTER CROWED A SECOND TIME

AND PETER REMEMBERED HOW JESUS HAD SAID TO HIM BEFORE THE ROOSTER CROWS TWICE YOU WILL DENY ME THREE TIMES

 AND HE BROKE DOWN AND WEPT

AND AS SOON AS IT WAS MORNING THE CHIEF PRIESTS HELD A CONSULTATION WITH THE ELDERS AND SCRIBES AND THE WHOLE COUNCIL

AND THEY BOUND JESUS AND LED HIM AWAY AND DELIVERED HIM OVER TO PILATE

AND PILATE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 AND HE ANSWERED HIM YOU HAVE SAID SO

 AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS ACCUSED HIM OF MANY THINGS

AND PILATE AGAIN ASKED HIM HAVE YOU NO ANSWER TO MAKE

SEE HOW MANY CHARGES THEY BRING AGAINST YOU

 BUT JESUS MADE NO FURTHER ANSWER SO THAT PILATE WAS AMAZED

NOW AT THE FEAST HE USED TO RELEASE FOR THEM ONE PRISONER FOR WHOM THEY ASKED

AND AMONG THE REBELS IN PRISON WHO HAD COMMITTED MURDER IN THE INSURRECTION THERE WAS A MAN CALLED BARABBAS

AND THE CROWD CAME UP AND BEGAN TO ASK PILATE TO DO AS HE USUALLY DID FOR THEM

AND HE ANSWERED THEM SAYING DO YOU WANT ME TO RELEASE FOR YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 FOR HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS OUT OF ENVY THAT THE CHIEF PRIESTS HAD DELIVERED HIM UP

BUT THE CHIEF PRIESTS STIRRED UP THE CROWD TO HAVE HIM RELEASE FOR THEM BARABBAS INSTEAD

AND PILATE AGAIN SAID TO THEM THEN WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE MAN YOU CALL THE KING OF THE JEWS

 AND THEY CRIED OUT AGAIN CRUCIFY HIM

 AND PILATE SAID TO THEM WHY WHAT EVIL HAS HE DONE

 BUT THEY SHOUTED ALL THE MORE CRUCIFY HIM

 SO PILATE WISHING TO SATISFY THE CROWD RELEASED FOR THEM BARABBAS AND HAVING SCOURGED JESUS HE DELIVERED HIM TO BE CRUCIFIED

AND THE SOLDIERS LED HIM AWAY INSIDE THE PALACE THAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S HEADQUARTERS AND THEY CALLED TOGETHER THE WHOLE BATTALION

AND THEY CLOTHED HIM IN A PURPLE CLOAK AND TWISTING TOGETHER A CROWN OF THORNS THEY PUT IT ON HIM

AND THEY BEGAN TO SALUTE HIM HAIL KING OF THE JEWS

 AND THEY WERE STRIKING HIS HEAD WITH A REED AND SPITTING ON HIM AND KNEELING DOWN IN HOMAGE TO HIM

AND WHEN THEY HAD MOCKED HIM THEY STRIPPED HIM OF THE PURPLE CLOAK AND PUT HIS OWN CLOTHES ON HIM

AND THEY LED HIM OUT TO CRUCIFY HIM

AND THEY COMPELLED A PASSERBY SIMON OF CYRENE WHO WAS COMING IN FROM THE COUNTRY THE FATHER OF ALEXANDER AND RUFUS TO CARRY HIS CROSS

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM TO THE PLACE CALLED GOLGOTHA WHICH MEANS PLACE OF A SKULL

AND THEY OFFERED HIM WINE MIXED WITH MYRRH BUT HE DID NOT TAKE IT

AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM AND DIVIDED HIS GARMENTS AMONG THEM CASTING LOTS FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHAT EACH SHOULD TAKE

AND IT WAS THE THIRD HOUR WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED HIM

AND THE INSCRIPTION OF THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM READ THE KING OF THE JEWS

 AND WITH HIM THEY CRUCIFIED TWO ROBBERS ONE ON HIS RIGHT AND ONE ON HIS LEFT

SEE FOOTNOTE AND THOSE WHO PASSED BY DERIDED HIM WAGGING THEIR HEADS AND SAYING AHA

YOU WHO WOULD DESTROY THE TEMPLE AND REBUILD IT IN THREE DAYS SAVE YOURSELF AND COME DOWN FROM THE CROSS

 SO ALSO THE CHIEF PRIESTS WITH THE SCRIBES MOCKED HIM TO ONE ANOTHER SAYING HE SAVED OTHERS; HE CANNOT SAVE HIMSELF

LET THE CHRIST THE KING OF ISRAEL COME DOWN NOW FROM THE CROSS THAT WE MAY SEE AND BELIEVE

 THOSE WHO WERE CRUCIFIED WITH HIM ALSO REVILED HIM

AND WHEN THE SIXTH HOUR HAD COME THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER THE WHOLE LAND UNTIL THE NINTH HOUR

AND AT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE ELOI ELOI LEMA SABACHTHANI

 WHICH MEANS MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME

 AND SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS HEARING IT SAID BEHOLD HE IS CALLING ELIJAH

 AND SOMEONE RAN AND FILLED A SPONGE WITH SOUR WINE PUT IT ON A REED AND GAVE IT TO HIM TO DRINK SAYING WAIT LET US SEE WHETHER ELIJAH WILL COME TO TAKE HIM DOWN

 AND JESUS UTTERED A LOUD CRY AND BREATHED HIS LAST

AND THE CURTAIN OF THE TEMPLE WAS TORN IN TWO FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

AND WHEN THE CENTURION WHO STOOD FACING HIM SAW THAT IN THIS WAY HE BREATHED HIS LAST HE SAID TRULY THIS MAN WAS THE SON OF GOD

 THERE WERE ALSO WOMEN LOOKING ON FROM A DISTANCE AMONG WHOM WERE MARY MAGDALENE AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JAMES THE YOUNGER AND OF JOSES AND SALOME

WHEN HE WAS IN GALILEE THEY FOLLOWED HIM AND MINISTERED TO HIM AND THERE WERE ALSO MANY OTHER WOMEN WHO CAME UP WITH HIM TO JERUSALEM

AND WHEN EVENING HAD COME SINCE IT WAS THE DAY OF PREPARATION THAT IS THE DAY BEFORE THE SABBATH JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA A RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL WHO WAS ALSO HIMSELF LOOKING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD TOOK COURAGE AND WENT TO PILATE AND ASKED FOR THE BODY OF JESUS

PILATE WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DIED

AND SUMMONING THE CENTURION HE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WAS ALREADY DEAD

AND WHEN HE LEARNED FROM THE CENTURION THAT HE WAS DEAD HE GRANTED THE CORPSE TO JOSEPH

AND JOSEPH BOUGHT A LINEN SHROUD AND TAKING HIM DOWN WRAPPED HIM IN THE LINEN SHROUD AND LAID HIM IN A TOMB THAT HAD BEEN CUT OUT OF THE ROCK

AND HE ROLLED A STONE AGAINST THE ENTRANCE OF THE TOMB

MARY MAGDALENE AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JOSES SAW WHERE HE WAS LAID

WHEN THE SABBATH WAS PAST MARY MAGDALENE AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JAMES AND SALOME BOUGHT SPICES SO THAT THEY MIGHT GO AND ANOINT HIM

AND VERY EARLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK WHEN THE SUN HAD RISEN THEY WENT TO THE TOMB

AND THEY WERE SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER WHO WILL ROLL AWAY THE STONE FOR US FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE TOMB

 AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW THAT THE STONE HAD BEEN ROLLED BACKIT WAS VERY LARGE

AND ENTERING THE TOMB THEY SAW A YOUNG MAN SITTING ON THE RIGHT SIDE DRESSED IN A WHITE ROBE AND THEY WERE ALARMED

AND HE SAID TO THEM DO NOT BE ALARMED

YOU SEEK JESUS OF NAZARETH WHO WAS CRUCIFIED

HE HAS RISEN; HE IS NOT HERE

SEE THE PLACE WHERE THEY LAID HIM

BUT GO TELL HIS DISCIPLES AND PETER THAT HE IS GOING BEFORE YOU TO GALILEE

THERE YOU WILL SEE HIM JUST AS HE TOLD YOU

 AND THEY WENT OUT AND FLED FROM THE TOMB FOR TREMBLING AND ASTONISHMENT HAD SEIZED THEM AND THEY SAID NOTHING TO ANYONE FOR THEY WERE AFRAID

[SOME OF THE EARLIEST MANUSCRIPTS DO NOT INCLUDE 

] [[NOW WHEN HE ROSE EARLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK HE APPEARED FIRST TO MARY MAGDALENE FROM WHOM HE HAD CAST OUT SEVEN DEMONS

SHE WENT AND TOLD THOSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM AS THEY MOURNED AND WEPT

BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND HAD BEEN SEEN BY HER THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT

AFTER THESE THINGS HE APPEARED IN ANOTHER FORM TO TWO OF THEM AS THEY WERE WALKING INTO THE COUNTRY

AND THEY WENT BACK AND TOLD THE REST BUT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THEM

AFTERWARD HE APPEARED TO THE ELEVEN THEMSELVES AS THEY WERE RECLINING AT TABLE AND HE REBUKED THEM FOR THEIR UNBELIEF AND HARDNESS OF HEART BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BELIEVED THOSE WHO SAW HIM AFTER HE HAD RISEN

AND HE SAID TO THEM GO INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PROCLAIM THE GOSPEL TO THE WHOLE CREATION

WHOEVER BELIEVES AND IS BAPTIZED WILL BE SAVED BUT WHOEVER DOES NOT BELIEVE WILL BE CONDEMNED

AND THESE SIGNS WILL ACCOMPANY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN MY NAME THEY WILL CAST OUT DEMONS; THEY WILL SPEAK IN NEW TONGUES; THEY WILL PICK UP SERPENTS WITH THEIR HANDS; AND IF THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY POISON IT WILL NOT HURT THEM; THEY WILL LAY THEIR HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY WILL RECOVER

 SO THEN THE LORD JESUS AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN TO THEM WAS TAKEN UP INTO HEAVEN AND SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD

AND THEY WENT OUT AND PREACHED EVERYWHERE WHILE THE LORD WORKED WITH THEM AND CONFIRMED THE MESSAGE BY ACCOMPANYING SIGNS

]]MATTHEWTHE BOOK OF THE GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF DAVID THE SON OF ABRAHAM

ABRAHAM WAS THE FATHER OF ISAAC AND ISAAC THE FATHER OF JACOB AND JACOB THE FATHER OF JUDAH AND HIS BROTHERS AND JUDAH THE FATHER OF PEREZ AND ZERAH BY TAMAR AND PEREZ THE FATHER OF HEZRON AND HEZRON THE FATHER OF RAM AND RAM THE FATHER OF AMMINADAB AND AMMINADAB THE FATHER OF NAHSHON AND NAHSHON THE FATHER OF SALMON AND SALMON THE FATHER OF BOAZ BY RAHAB AND BOAZ THE FATHER OF OBED BY RUTH AND OBED THE FATHER OF JESSE AND JESSE THE FATHER OF DAVID THE KING

AND DAVID WAS THE FATHER OF SOLOMON BY THE WIFE OF URIAH AND SOLOMON THE FATHER OF REHOBOAM AND REHOBOAM THE FATHER OF ABIJAH AND ABIJAH THE FATHER OF ASAPH AND ASAPH THE FATHER OF JEHOSHAPHAT AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE FATHER OF JORAM AND JORAM THE FATHER OF UZZIAH AND UZZIAH THE FATHER OF JOTHAM AND JOTHAM THE FATHER OF AHAZ AND AHAZ THE FATHER OF HEZEKIAH AND HEZEKIAH THE FATHER OF MANASSEH AND MANASSEH THE FATHER OF AMOS AND AMOS THE FATHER OF JOSIAH AND JOSIAH THE FATHER OF JECHONIAH AND HIS BROTHERS AT THE TIME OF THE DEPORTATION TO BABYLON

AND AFTER THE DEPORTATION TO BABYLON JECHONIAH WAS THE FATHER OF SHEALTIEL AND SHEALTIEL THE FATHER OF ZERUBBABEL AND ZERUBBABEL THE FATHER OF ABIUD AND ABIUD THE FATHER OF ELIAKIM AND ELIAKIM THE FATHER OF AZOR AND AZOR THE FATHER OF ZADOK AND ZADOK THE FATHER OF ACHIM AND ACHIM THE FATHER OF ELIUD AND ELIUD THE FATHER OF ELEAZAR AND ELEAZAR THE FATHER OF MATTHAN AND MATTHAN THE FATHER OF JACOB AND JACOB THE FATHER OF JOSEPH THE HUSBAND OF MARY OF WHOM JESUS WAS BORN WHO IS CALLED CHRIST

SO ALL THE GENERATIONS FROM ABRAHAM TO DAVID WERE FOURTEEN GENERATIONS AND FROM DAVID TO THE DEPORTATION TO BABYLON FOURTEEN GENERATIONS AND FROM THE DEPORTATION TO BABYLON TO THE CHRIST FOURTEEN GENERATIONS

NOW THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST TOOK PLACE IN THIS WAY

WHEN HIS MOTHER MARY HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO JOSEPH BEFORE THEY CAME TOGETHER SHE WAS FOUND TO BE WITH CHILD FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT

AND HER HUSBAND JOSEPH BEING A JUST MAN AND UNWILLING TO PUT HER TO SHAME RESOLVED TO DIVORCE HER QUIETLY

BUT AS HE CONSIDERED THESE THINGS BEHOLD AN ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM IN A DREAM SAYING JOSEPH SON OF DAVID DO NOT FEAR TO TAKE MARY AS YOUR WIFE FOR THAT WHICH IS CONCEIVED IN HER IS FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT

SHE WILL BEAR A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME JESUS FOR HE WILL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS

 ALL THIS TOOK PLACE TO FULFILL WHAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET BEHOLD THE VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE AND BEAR A SON AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUELWHICH MEANS GOD WITH US

WHEN JOSEPH WOKE FROM SLEEP HE DID AS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD COMMANDED HIM HE TOOK HIS WIFE BUT KNEW HER NOT UNTIL SHE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO A SON

AND HE CALLED HIS NAME JESUS

NOW AFTER JESUS WAS BORN IN BETHLEHEM OF JUDEA IN THE DAYS OF HEROD THE KING BEHOLD WISE MEN FROM THE EAST CAME TO JERUSALEM SAYING WHERE IS HE WHO HAS BEEN BORN KING OF THE JEWS

FOR WE SAW HIS STAR WHEN IT ROSE AND HAVE COME TO WORSHIP HIM

 WHEN HEROD THE KING HEARD THIS HE WAS TROUBLED AND ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM; AND ASSEMBLING ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND SCRIBES OF THE PEOPLE HE INQUIRED OF THEM WHERE THE CHRIST WAS TO BE BORN

THEY TOLD HIM IN BETHLEHEM OF JUDEA FOR SO IT IS WRITTEN BY THE PROPHET 'AND YOU O BETHLEHEM IN THE LAND OF JUDAH ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE RULERS OF JUDAH; FOR FROM YOU SHALL COME A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' THEN HEROD SUMMONED THE WISE MEN SECRETLY AND ASCERTAINED FROM THEM WHAT TIME THE STAR HAD APPEARED

AND HE SENT THEM TO BETHLEHEM SAYING GO AND SEARCH DILIGENTLY FOR THE CHILD AND WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HIM BRING ME WORD THAT I TOO MAY COME AND WORSHIP HIM

 AFTER LISTENING TO THE KING THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY

AND BEHOLD THE STAR THAT THEY HAD SEEN WHEN IT ROSE WENT BEFORE THEM UNTIL IT CAME TO REST OVER THE PLACE WHERE THE CHILD WAS

WHEN THEY SAW THE STAR THEY REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY WITH GREAT JOY

AND GOING INTO THE HOUSE THEY SAW THE CHILD WITH MARY HIS MOTHER AND THEY FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPED HIM

THEN OPENING THEIR TREASURES THEY OFFERED HIM GIFTS GOLD AND FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH

AND BEING WARNED IN A DREAM NOT TO RETURN TO HEROD THEY DEPARTED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY BY ANOTHER WAY

NOW WHEN THEY HAD DEPARTED BEHOLD AN ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO JOSEPH IN A DREAM AND SAID RISE TAKE THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER AND FLEE TO EGYPT AND REMAIN THERE UNTIL I TELL YOU FOR HEROD IS ABOUT TO SEARCH FOR THE CHILD TO DESTROY HIM

 AND HE ROSE AND TOOK THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER BY NIGHT AND DEPARTED TO EGYPT AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE DEATH OF HEROD

THIS WAS TO FULFILL WHAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON

 THEN HEROD WHEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN TRICKED BY THE WISE MEN BECAME FURIOUS AND HE SENT AND KILLED ALL THE MALE CHILDREN IN BETHLEHEM AND IN ALL THAT REGION WHO WERE TWO YEARS OLD OR UNDER ACCORDING TO THE TIME THAT HE HAD ASCERTAINED FROM THE WISE MEN

THEN WAS FULFILLED WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET JEREMIAH A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH WEEPING AND LOUD LAMENTATION RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED BECAUSE THEY ARE NO MORE

 BUT WHEN HEROD DIED BEHOLD AN ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED IN A DREAM TO JOSEPH IN EGYPT SAYING RISE TAKE THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER AND GO TO THE LAND OF ISRAEL FOR THOSE WHO SOUGHT THE CHILD'S LIFE ARE DEAD

 AND HE ROSE AND TOOK THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER AND WENT TO THE LAND OF ISRAEL

BUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT ARCHELAUS WAS REIGNING OVER JUDEA IN PLACE OF HIS FATHER HEROD HE WAS AFRAID TO GO THERE AND BEING WARNED IN A DREAM HE WITHDREW TO THE DISTRICT OF GALILEE

AND HE WENT AND LIVED IN A CITY CALLED NAZARETH THAT WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHETS MIGHT BE FULFILLED HE SHALL BE CALLED A NAZARENE

IN THOSE DAYS JOHN THE BAPTIST CAME PREACHING IN THE WILDERNESS OF JUDEA REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND

 FOR THIS IS HE WHO WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH WHEN HE SAID THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS 'PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD; MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT

' NOW JOHN WORE A GARMENT OF CAMEL'S HAIR AND A LEATHER BELT AROUND HIS WAIST AND HIS FOOD WAS LOCUSTS AND WILD HONEY

THEN JERUSALEM AND ALL JUDEA AND ALL THE REGION ABOUT THE JORDAN WERE GOING OUT TO HIM AND THEY WERE BAPTIZED BY HIM IN THE RIVER JORDAN CONFESSING THEIR SINS

BUT WHEN HE SAW MANY OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES COMING FOR BAPTISM HE SAID TO THEM YOU BROOD OF VIPERS

WHO WARNED YOU TO FLEE FROM THE WRATH TO COME

BEAR FRUIT IN KEEPING WITH REPENTANCE

AND DO NOT PRESUME TO SAY TO YOURSELVES 'WE HAVE ABRAHAM AS OUR FATHER' FOR I TELL YOU GOD IS ABLE FROM THESE STONES TO RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR ABRAHAM

EVEN NOW THE AXE IS LAID TO THE ROOT OF THE TREES

EVERY TREE THEREFORE THAT DOES NOT BEAR GOOD FRUIT IS CUT DOWN AND THROWN INTO THE FIRE

I BAPTIZE YOU WITH WATER FOR REPENTANCE BUT HE WHO IS COMING AFTER ME IS MIGHTIER THAN I WHOSE SANDALS I AM NOT WORTHY TO CARRY

HE WILL BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND WITH FIRE

HIS WINNOWING FORK IS IN HIS HAND AND HE WILL CLEAR HIS THRESHING FLOOR AND GATHER HIS WHEAT INTO THE BARN BUT THE CHAFF HE WILL BURN WITH UNQUENCHABLE FIRE

 THEN JESUS CAME FROM GALILEE TO THE JORDAN TO JOHN TO BE BAPTIZED BY HIM

JOHN WOULD HAVE PREVENTED HIM SAYING I NEED TO BE BAPTIZED BY YOU AND DO YOU COME TO ME

 BUT JESUS ANSWERED HIM LET IT BE SO NOW FOR THUS IT IS FITTING FOR US TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS

 THEN HE CONSENTED

AND WHEN JESUS WAS BAPTIZED IMMEDIATELY HE WENT UP FROM THE WATER AND BEHOLD THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED TO HIM AND HE SAW THE SPIRIT OF GOD DESCENDING LIKE A DOVE AND COMING TO REST ON HIM; AND BEHOLD A VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAID THIS IS MY BELOVED SON WITH WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED

THEN JESUS WAS LED UP BY THE SPIRIT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL

AND AFTER FASTING FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS HE WAS HUNGRY

AND THE TEMPTER CAME AND SAID TO HIM IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD COMMAND THESE STONES TO BECOME LOAVES OF BREAD

 BUT HE ANSWERED IT IS WRITTEN 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT COMES FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD

' THEN THE DEVIL TOOK HIM TO THE HOLY CITY AND SET HIM ON THE PINNACLE OF THE TEMPLE AND SAID TO HIM IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD THROW YOURSELF DOWN FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU'AND 'ON THEIR HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE

' JESUS SAID TO HIM AGAIN IT IS WRITTEN 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST

' AGAIN THE DEVIL TOOK HIM TO A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD AND THEIR GLORY

AND HE SAID TO HIM ALL THESE I WILL GIVE YOU IF YOU WILL FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP ME

 THEN JESUS SAID TO HIM BE GONE SATAN

FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE

' THEN THE DEVIL LEFT HIM AND BEHOLD ANGELS CAME AND WERE MINISTERING TO HIM

NOW WHEN HE HEARD THAT JOHN HAD BEEN ARRESTED HE WITHDREW INTO GALILEE

AND LEAVING NAZARETH HE WENT AND LIVED IN CAPERNAUM BY THE SEA IN THE TERRITORY OF ZEBULUN AND NAPHTALI SO THAT WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH MIGHT BE FULFILLED THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI THE WAY OF THE SEA BEYOND THE JORDAN GALILEE OF THE GENTILES THE PEOPLE DWELLING IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT AND FOR THOSE DWELLING IN THE REGION AND SHADOW OF DEATH ON THEM A LIGHT HAS DAWNED

 FROM THAT TIME JESUS BEGAN TO PREACH SAYING REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND

 WHILE WALKING BY THE SEA OF GALILEE HE SAW TWO BROTHERS SIMON WHO IS CALLED PETER AND ANDREW HIS BROTHER CASTING A NET INTO THE SEA FOR THEY WERE FISHERMEN

AND HE SAID TO THEM FOLLOW ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU FISHERS OF MEN

 IMMEDIATELY THEY LEFT THEIR NETS AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND GOING ON FROM THERE HE SAW TWO OTHER BROTHERS JAMES THE SON OF ZEBEDEE AND JOHN HIS BROTHER IN THE BOAT WITH ZEBEDEE THEIR FATHER MENDING THEIR NETS AND HE CALLED THEM

IMMEDIATELY THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND THEIR FATHER AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND HE WENT THROUGHOUT ALL GALILEE TEACHING IN THEIR SYNAGOGUES AND PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM AND HEALING EVERY DISEASE AND EVERY AFFLICTION AMONG THE PEOPLE

SO HIS FAME SPREAD THROUGHOUT ALL SYRIA AND THEY BROUGHT HIM ALL THE SICK THOSE AFFLICTED WITH VARIOUS DISEASES AND PAINS THOSE OPPRESSED BY DEMONS EPILEPTICS AND PARALYTICS AND HE HEALED THEM

AND GREAT CROWDS FOLLOWED HIM FROM GALILEE AND THE DECAPOLIS AND FROM JERUSALEM AND JUDEA AND FROM BEYOND THE JORDAN

SEEING THE CROWDS HE WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN HE SAT DOWN HIS DISCIPLES CAME TO HIM

AND HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND TAUGHT THEM SAYING BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO MOURN FOR THEY SHALL BE COMFORTED

BLESSED ARE THE MEEK FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO HUNGER AND THIRST FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THEY SHALL BE SATISFIED

BLESSED ARE THE MERCIFUL FOR THEY SHALL RECEIVE MERCY

BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD

BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS FOR THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF GOD

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO ARE PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

BLESSED ARE YOU WHEN OTHERS REVILE YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU AND UTTER ALL KINDS OF EVIL AGAINST YOU FALSELY ON MY ACCOUNT

REJOICE AND BE GLAD FOR YOUR REWARD IS GREAT IN HEAVEN FOR SO THEY PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS WHO WERE BEFORE YOU

YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT IF SALT HAS LOST ITS TASTE HOW SHALL ITS SALTINESS BE RESTORED

IT IS NO LONGER GOOD FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT TO BE THROWN OUT AND TRAMPLED UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET

YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

A CITY SET ON A HILL CANNOT BE HIDDEN

NOR DO PEOPLE LIGHT A LAMP AND PUT IT UNDER A BASKET BUT ON A STAND AND IT GIVES LIGHT TO ALL IN THE HOUSE

IN THE SAME WAY LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE BEFORE OTHERS SO THAT THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD WORKS AND GIVE GLORY TO YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE COME TO ABOLISH THE LAW OR THE PROPHETS; I HAVE NOT COME TO ABOLISH THEM BUT TO FULFILL THEM

FOR TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNTIL HEAVEN AND EARTH PASS AWAY NOT AN IOTA NOT A DOT WILL PASS FROM THE LAW UNTIL ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED

THEREFORE WHOEVER RELAXES ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE COMMANDMENTS AND TEACHES OTHERS TO DO THE SAME WILL BE CALLED LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BUT WHOEVER DOES THEM AND TEACHES THEM WILL BE CALLED GREAT IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

FOR I TELL YOU UNLESS YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS EXCEEDS THAT OF THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES YOU WILL NEVER ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT WAS SAID TO THOSE OF OLD 'YOU SHALL NOT MURDER; AND WHOEVER MURDERS WILL BE LIABLE TO JUDGMENT

' BUT I SAY TO YOU THAT EVERYONE WHO IS ANGRY WITH HIS BROTHER WILL BE LIABLE TO JUDGMENT; WHOEVER INSULTS HIS BROTHER WILL BE LIABLE TO THE COUNCIL; AND WHOEVER SAYS 'YOU FOOL

' WILL BE LIABLE TO THE HELL OF FIRE

SO IF YOU ARE OFFERING YOUR GIFT AT THE ALTAR AND THERE REMEMBER THAT YOUR BROTHER HAS SOMETHING AGAINST YOU LEAVE YOUR GIFT THERE BEFORE THE ALTAR AND GO

FIRST BE RECONCILED TO YOUR BROTHER AND THEN COME AND OFFER YOUR GIFT

COME TO TERMS QUICKLY WITH YOUR ACCUSER WHILE YOU ARE GOING WITH HIM TO COURT LEST YOUR ACCUSER HAND YOU OVER TO THE JUDGE AND THE JUDGE TO THE GUARD AND YOU BE PUT IN PRISON

TRULY I SAY TO YOU YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID THE LAST PENNY

YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT WAS SAID 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY

' BUT I SAY TO YOU THAT EVERYONE WHO LOOKS AT A WOMAN WITH LUSTFUL INTENT HAS ALREADY COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH HER IN HIS HEART

IF YOUR RIGHT EYE CAUSES YOU TO SIN TEAR IT OUT AND THROW IT AWAY

FOR IT IS BETTER THAT YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS THAN THAT YOUR WHOLE BODY BE THROWN INTO HELL

AND IF YOUR RIGHT HAND CAUSES YOU TO SIN CUT IT OFF AND THROW IT AWAY

FOR IT IS BETTER THAT YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS THAN THAT YOUR WHOLE BODY GO INTO HELL

IT WAS ALSO SAID 'WHOEVER DIVORCES HIS WIFE LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE

' BUT I SAY TO YOU THAT EVERYONE WHO DIVORCES HIS WIFE EXCEPT ON THE GROUND OF SEXUAL IMMORALITY MAKES HER COMMIT ADULTERY

AND WHOEVER MARRIES A DIVORCED WOMAN COMMITS ADULTERY

AGAIN YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT WAS SAID TO THOSE OF OLD 'YOU SHALL NOT SWEAR FALSELY BUT SHALL PERFORM TO THE LORD WHAT YOU HAVE SWORN

' BUT I SAY TO YOU DO NOT TAKE AN OATH AT ALL EITHER BY HEAVEN FOR IT IS THE THRONE OF GOD OR BY THE EARTH FOR IT IS HIS FOOTSTOOL OR BY JERUSALEM FOR IT IS THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING

AND DO NOT TAKE AN OATH BY YOUR HEAD FOR YOU CANNOT MAKE ONE HAIR WHITE OR BLACK

LET WHAT YOU SAY BE SIMPLY 'YES' OR 'NO'; ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS COMES FROM EVIL

YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT WAS SAID 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

' BUT I SAY TO YOU DO NOT RESIST THE ONE WHO IS EVIL

BUT IF ANYONE SLAPS YOU ON THE RIGHT CHEEK TURN TO HIM THE OTHER ALSO

AND IF ANYONE WOULD SUE YOU AND TAKE YOUR TUNIC LET HIM HAVE YOUR CLOAK AS WELL

AND IF ANYONE FORCES YOU TO GO ONE MILE GO WITH HIM TWO MILES

GIVE TO THE ONE WHO BEGS FROM YOU AND DO NOT REFUSE THE ONE WHO WOULD BORROW FROM YOU

YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT WAS SAID 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AND HATE YOUR ENEMY

' BUT I SAY TO YOU LOVE YOUR ENEMIES AND PRAY FOR THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE SONS OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

FOR HE MAKES HIS SUN RISE ON THE EVIL AND ON THE GOOD AND SENDS RAIN ON THE JUST AND ON THE UNJUST

FOR IF YOU LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE YOU WHAT REWARD DO YOU HAVE

DO NOT EVEN THE TAX COLLECTORS DO THE SAME

AND IF YOU GREET ONLY YOUR BROTHERS WHAT MORE ARE YOU DOING THAN OTHERS

DO NOT EVEN THE GENTILES DO THE SAME

YOU THEREFORE MUST BE PERFECT AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS PERFECT

BEWARE OF PRACTICING YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE IN ORDER TO BE SEEN BY THEM FOR THEN YOU WILL HAVE NO REWARD FROM YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

THUS WHEN YOU GIVE TO THE NEEDY SOUND NO TRUMPET BEFORE YOU AS THE HYPOCRITES DO IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND IN THE STREETS THAT THEY MAY BE PRAISED BY OTHERS

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR REWARD

BUT WHEN YOU GIVE TO THE NEEDY DO NOT LET YOUR LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT YOUR RIGHT HAND IS DOING SO THAT YOUR GIVING MAY BE IN SECRET

AND YOUR FATHER WHO SEES IN SECRET WILL REWARD YOU

AND WHEN YOU PRAY YOU MUST NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES

FOR THEY LOVE TO STAND AND PRAY IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND AT THE STREET CORNERS THAT THEY MAY BE SEEN BY OTHERS

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR REWARD

BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR AND PRAY TO YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN SECRET

AND YOUR FATHER WHO SEES IN SECRET WILL REWARD YOU

AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT HEAP UP EMPTY PHRASES AS THE GENTILES DO FOR THEY THINK THAT THEY WILL BE HEARD FOR THEIR MANY WORDS

DO NOT BE LIKE THEM FOR YOUR FATHER KNOWS WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE YOU ASK HIM

PRAY THEN LIKE THIS OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN HALLOWED BE YOUR NAME

YOUR KINGDOM COME YOUR WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN

GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS AS WE ALSO HAVE FORGIVEN OUR DEBTORS

AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL

FOR IF YOU FORGIVE OTHERS THEIR TRESPASSES YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL ALSO FORGIVE YOU BUT IF YOU DO NOT FORGIVE OTHERS THEIR TRESPASSES NEITHER WILL YOUR FATHER FORGIVE YOUR TRESPASSES

AND WHEN YOU FAST DO NOT LOOK GLOOMY LIKE THE HYPOCRITES FOR THEY DISFIGURE THEIR FACES THAT THEIR FASTING MAY BE SEEN BY OTHERS

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR REWARD

BUT WHEN YOU FAST ANOINT YOUR HEAD AND WASH YOUR FACE THAT YOUR FASTING MAY NOT BE SEEN BY OTHERS BUT BY YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN SECRET

AND YOUR FATHER WHO SEES IN SECRET WILL REWARD YOU

DO NOT LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES ON EARTH WHERE MOTH AND RUST DESTROY AND WHERE THIEVES BREAK IN AND STEAL BUT LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN WHERE NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST DESTROYS AND WHERE THIEVES DO NOT BREAK IN AND STEAL

FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE YOUR HEART WILL BE ALSO

THE EYE IS THE LAMP OF THE BODY

SO IF YOUR EYE IS HEALTHY YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL BE FULL OF LIGHT BUT IF YOUR EYE IS BAD YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL BE FULL OF DARKNESS

IF THEN THE LIGHT IN YOU IS DARKNESS HOW GREAT IS THE DARKNESS

NO ONE CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS FOR EITHER HE WILL HATE THE ONE AND LOVE THE OTHER OR HE WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE ONE AND DESPISE THE OTHER

YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MONEY

THEREFORE I TELL YOU DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU WILL EAT OR WHAT YOU WILL DRINK NOR ABOUT YOUR BODY WHAT YOU WILL PUT ON

IS NOT LIFE MORE THAN FOOD AND THE BODY MORE THAN CLOTHING

LOOK AT THE BIRDS OF THE AIR THEY NEITHER SOW NOR REAP NOR GATHER INTO BARNS AND YET YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER FEEDS THEM

ARE YOU NOT OF MORE VALUE THAN THEY

AND WHICH OF YOU BY BEING ANXIOUS CAN ADD A SINGLE HOUR TO HIS SPAN OF LIFE

AND WHY ARE YOU ANXIOUS ABOUT CLOTHING

CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW THEY NEITHER TOIL NOR SPIN YET I TELL YOU EVEN SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY WAS NOT ARRAYED LIKE ONE OF THESE

BUT IF GOD SO CLOTHES THE GRASS OF THE FIELD WHICH TODAY IS ALIVE AND TOMORROW IS THROWN INTO THE OVEN WILL HE NOT MUCH MORE CLOTHE YOU O YOU OF LITTLE FAITH

THEREFORE DO NOT BE ANXIOUS SAYING 'WHAT SHALL WE EAT

' OR 'WHAT SHALL WE DRINK

' OR 'WHAT SHALL WE WEAR

' FOR THE GENTILES SEEK AFTER ALL THESE THINGS AND YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWS THAT YOU NEED THEM ALL

BUT SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THESE THINGS WILL BE ADDED TO YOU

THEREFORE DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT TOMORROW FOR TOMORROW WILL BE ANXIOUS FOR ITSELF

SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY IS ITS OWN TROUBLE

JUDGE NOT THAT YOU BE NOT JUDGED

FOR WITH THE JUDGMENT YOU PRONOUNCE YOU WILL BE JUDGED AND WITH THE MEASURE YOU USE IT WILL BE MEASURED TO YOU

WHY DO YOU SEE THE SPECK THAT IS IN YOUR BROTHER'S EYE BUT DO NOT NOTICE THE LOG THAT IS IN YOUR OWN EYE

OR HOW CAN YOU SAY TO YOUR BROTHER 'LET ME TAKE THE SPECK OUT OF YOUR EYE' WHEN THERE IS THE LOG IN YOUR OWN EYE

YOU HYPOCRITE FIRST TAKE THE LOG OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE AND THEN YOU WILL SEE CLEARLY TO TAKE THE SPECK OUT OF YOUR BROTHER'S EYE

DO NOT GIVE DOGS WHAT IS HOLY AND DO NOT THROW YOUR PEARLS BEFORE PIGS LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDERFOOT AND TURN TO ATTACK YOU

ASK AND IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU; SEEK AND YOU WILL FIND; KNOCK AND IT WILL BE OPENED TO YOU

FOR EVERYONE WHO ASKS RECEIVES AND THE ONE WHO SEEKS FINDS AND TO THE ONE WHO KNOCKS IT WILL BE OPENED

OR WHICH ONE OF YOU IF HIS SON ASKS HIM FOR BREAD WILL GIVE HIM A STONE

OR IF HE ASKS FOR A FISH WILL GIVE HIM A SERPENT

IF YOU THEN WHO ARE EVIL KNOW HOW TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS TO YOUR CHILDREN HOW MUCH MORE WILL YOUR FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN GIVE GOOD THINGS TO THOSE WHO ASK HIM

SO WHATEVER YOU WISH THAT OTHERS WOULD DO TO YOU DO ALSO TO THEM FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS

ENTER BY THE NARROW GATE

FOR THE GATE IS WIDE AND THE WAY IS EASY THAT LEADS TO DESTRUCTION AND THOSE WHO ENTER BY IT ARE MANY

FOR THE GATE IS NARROW AND THE WAY IS HARD THAT LEADS TO LIFE AND THOSE WHO FIND IT ARE FEW

BEWARE OF FALSE PROPHETS WHO COME TO YOU IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING BUT INWARDLY ARE RAVENOUS WOLVES

YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THEM BY THEIR FRUITS

ARE GRAPES GATHERED FROM THORNBUSHES OR FIGS FROM THISTLES

SO EVERY HEALTHY TREE BEARS GOOD FRUIT BUT THE DISEASED TREE BEARS BAD FRUIT

A HEALTHY TREE CANNOT BEAR BAD FRUIT NOR CAN A DISEASED TREE BEAR GOOD FRUIT

EVERY TREE THAT DOES NOT BEAR GOOD FRUIT IS CUT DOWN AND THROWN INTO THE FIRE

THUS YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THEM BY THEIR FRUITS

NOT EVERYONE WHO SAYS TO ME 'LORD LORD' WILL ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BUT THE ONE WHO DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

ON THAT DAY MANY WILL SAY TO ME 'LORD LORD DID WE NOT PROPHESY IN YOUR NAME AND CAST OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME AND DO MANY MIGHTY WORKS IN YOUR NAME

' AND THEN WILL I DECLARE TO THEM 'I NEVER KNEW YOU; DEPART FROM ME YOU WORKERS OF LAWLESSNESS

' EVERYONE THEN WHO HEARS THESE WORDS OF MINE AND DOES THEM WILL BE LIKE A WISE MAN WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE ON THE ROCK

AND THE RAIN FELL AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND BEAT ON THAT HOUSE BUT IT DID NOT FALL BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED ON THE ROCK

AND EVERYONE WHO HEARS THESE WORDS OF MINE AND DOES NOT DO THEM WILL BE LIKE A FOOLISH MAN WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE ON THE SAND

AND THE RAIN FELL AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND BEAT AGAINST THAT HOUSE AND IT FELL AND GREAT WAS THE FALL OF IT

 AND WHEN JESUS FINISHED THESE SAYINGS THE CROWDS WERE ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING FOR HE WAS TEACHING THEM AS ONE WHO HAD AUTHORITY AND NOT AS THEIR SCRIBES

WHEN HE CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN GREAT CROWDS FOLLOWED HIM

AND BEHOLD A LEPER CAME TO HIM AND KNELT BEFORE HIM SAYING LORD IF YOU WILL YOU CAN MAKE ME CLEAN

 AND JESUS STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED HIM SAYING I WILL; BE CLEAN

 AND IMMEDIATELY HIS LEPROSY WAS CLEANSED

AND JESUS SAID TO HIM SEE THAT YOU SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE BUT GO SHOW YOURSELF TO THE PRIEST AND OFFER THE GIFT THAT MOSES COMMANDED FOR A PROOF TO THEM

 WHEN HE ENTERED CAPERNAUM A CENTURION CAME FORWARD TO HIM APPEALING TO HIM LORD MY SERVANT IS LYING PARALYZED AT HOME SUFFERING TERRIBLY

 AND HE SAID TO HIM I WILL COME AND HEAL HIM

 BUT THE CENTURION REPLIED LORD I AM NOT WORTHY TO HAVE YOU COME UNDER MY ROOF BUT ONLY SAY THE WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED

FOR I TOO AM A MAN UNDER AUTHORITY WITH SOLDIERS UNDER ME

AND I SAY TO ONE 'GO' AND HE GOES AND TO ANOTHER 'COME' AND HE COMES AND TO MY SERVANT 'DO THIS' AND HE DOES IT

 WHEN JESUS HEARD THIS HE MARVELED AND SAID TO THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIM TRULY I TELL YOU WITH NO ONE IN ISRAEL HAVE I FOUND SUCH FAITH

I TELL YOU MANY WILL COME FROM EAST AND WEST AND RECLINE AT TABLE WITH ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN WHILE THE SONS OF THE KINGDOM WILL BE THROWN INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

 AND TO THE CENTURION JESUS SAID GO; LET IT BE DONE FOR YOU AS YOU HAVE BELIEVED

 AND THE SERVANT WAS HEALED AT THAT VERY MOMENT

AND WHEN JESUS ENTERED PETER'S HOUSE HE SAW HIS MOTHERINLAW LYING SICK WITH A FEVER

HE TOUCHED HER HAND AND THE FEVER LEFT HER AND SHE ROSE AND BEGAN TO SERVE HIM

THAT EVENING THEY BROUGHT TO HIM MANY WHO WERE OPPRESSED BY DEMONS AND HE CAST OUT THE SPIRITS WITH A WORD AND HEALED ALL WHO WERE SICK

THIS WAS TO FULFILL WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH HE TOOK OUR ILLNESSES AND BORE OUR DISEASES

 NOW WHEN JESUS SAW A GREAT CROWD AROUND HIM HE GAVE ORDERS TO GO OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE

AND A SCRIBE CAME UP AND SAID TO HIM TEACHER I WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM FOXES HAVE HOLES AND BIRDS OF THE AIR HAVE NESTS BUT THE SON OF MAN HAS NOWHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD

 ANOTHER OF THE DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM LORD LET ME FIRST GO AND BURY MY FATHER

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME AND LEAVE THE DEAD TO BURY THEIR OWN DEAD

 AND WHEN HE GOT INTO THE BOAT HIS DISCIPLES FOLLOWED HIM

AND BEHOLD THERE AROSE A GREAT STORM ON THE SEA SO THAT THE BOAT WAS BEING SWAMPED BY THE WAVES; BUT HE WAS ASLEEP

AND THEY WENT AND WOKE HIM SAYING SAVE US LORD; WE ARE PERISHING

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU AFRAID O YOU OF LITTLE FAITH

 THEN HE ROSE AND REBUKED THE WINDS AND THE SEA AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM

AND THE MEN MARVELED SAYING WHAT SORT OF MAN IS THIS THAT EVEN WINDS AND SEA OBEY HIM

 AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GADARENES TWO DEMONPOSSESSED MEN MET HIM COMING OUT OF THE TOMBS SO FIERCE THAT NO ONE COULD PASS THAT WAY

AND BEHOLD THEY CRIED OUT WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH US O SON OF GOD

HAVE YOU COME HERE TO TORMENT US BEFORE THE TIME

 NOW A HERD OF MANY PIGS WAS FEEDING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM

AND THE DEMONS BEGGED HIM SAYING IF YOU CAST US OUT SEND US AWAY INTO THE HERD OF PIGS

 AND HE SAID TO THEM GO

 SO THEY CAME OUT AND WENT INTO THE PIGS AND BEHOLD THE WHOLE HERD RUSHED DOWN THE STEEP BANK INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED IN THE WATERS

THE HERDSMEN FLED AND GOING INTO THE CITY THEY TOLD EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE DEMONPOSSESSED MEN

AND BEHOLD ALL THE CITY CAME OUT TO MEET JESUS AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM THEY BEGGED HIM TO LEAVE THEIR REGION

AND GETTING INTO A BOAT HE CROSSED OVER AND CAME TO HIS OWN CITY

AND BEHOLD SOME PEOPLE BROUGHT TO HIM A PARALYTIC LYING ON A BED

AND WHEN JESUS SAW THEIR FAITH HE SAID TO THE PARALYTIC TAKE HEART MY SON; YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN

 AND BEHOLD SOME OF THE SCRIBES SAID TO THEMSELVES THIS MAN IS BLASPHEMING

 BUT JESUS KNOWING THEIR THOUGHTS SAID WHY DO YOU THINK EVIL IN YOUR HEARTS

FOR WHICH IS EASIER TO SAY 'YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN' OR TO SAY 'RISE AND WALK'

BUT THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS AUTHORITY ON EARTH TO FORGIVE SINSHE THEN SAID TO THE PARALYTICRISE PICK UP YOUR BED AND GO HOME

 AND HE ROSE AND WENT HOME

WHEN THE CROWDS SAW IT THEY WERE AFRAID AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD WHO HAD GIVEN SUCH AUTHORITY TO MEN

AS JESUS PASSED ON FROM THERE HE SAW A MAN CALLED MATTHEW SITTING AT THE TAX BOOTH AND HE SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME

 AND HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND AS JESUS RECLINED AT TABLE IN THE HOUSE BEHOLD MANY TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS CAME AND WERE RECLINING WITH JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES

AND WHEN THE PHARISEES SAW THIS THEY SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES WHY DOES YOUR TEACHER EAT WITH TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS

 BUT WHEN HE HEARD IT HE SAID THOSE WHO ARE WELL HAVE NO NEED OF A PHYSICIAN BUT THOSE WHO ARE SICK

GO AND LEARN WHAT THIS MEANS 'I DESIRE MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE

' FOR I CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS BUT SINNERS

 THEN THE DISCIPLES OF JOHN CAME TO HIM SAYING WHY DO WE AND THE PHARISEES FAST BUT YOUR DISCIPLES DO NOT FAST

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM CAN THE WEDDING GUESTS MOURN AS LONG AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS WITH THEM

THE DAYS WILL COME WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND THEN THEY WILL FAST

NO ONE PUTS A PIECE OF UNSHRUNK CLOTH ON AN OLD GARMENT FOR THE PATCH TEARS AWAY FROM THE GARMENT AND A WORSE TEAR IS MADE

NEITHER IS NEW WINE PUT INTO OLD WINESKINS

IF IT IS THE SKINS BURST AND THE WINE IS SPILLED AND THE SKINS ARE DESTROYED

BUT NEW WINE IS PUT INTO FRESH WINESKINS AND SO BOTH ARE PRESERVED

 WHILE HE WAS SAYING THESE THINGS TO THEM BEHOLD A RULER CAME IN AND KNELT BEFORE HIM SAYING MY DAUGHTER HAS JUST DIED BUT COME AND LAY YOUR HAND ON HER AND SHE WILL LIVE

 AND JESUS ROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS DISCIPLES

AND BEHOLD A WOMAN WHO HAD SUFFERED FROM A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR TWELVE YEARS CAME UP BEHIND HIM AND TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF HIS GARMENT FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF I ONLY TOUCH HIS GARMENT I WILL BE MADE WELL

 JESUS TURNED AND SEEING HER HE SAID TAKE HEART DAUGHTER; YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL

 AND INSTANTLY THE WOMAN WAS MADE WELL

AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE RULER'S HOUSE AND SAW THE FLUTE PLAYERS AND THE CROWD MAKING A COMMOTION HE SAID GO AWAY FOR THE GIRL IS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPING

 AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM

BUT WHEN THE CROWD HAD BEEN PUT OUTSIDE HE WENT IN AND TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND THE GIRL AROSE

AND THE REPORT OF THIS WENT THROUGH ALL THAT DISTRICT

AND AS JESUS PASSED ON FROM THERE TWO BLIND MEN FOLLOWED HIM CRYING ALOUD HAVE MERCY ON US SON OF DAVID

 WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE BLIND MEN CAME TO HIM AND JESUS SAID TO THEM DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I AM ABLE TO DO THIS

 THEY SAID TO HIM YES LORD

 THEN HE TOUCHED THEIR EYES SAYING ACCORDING TO YOUR FAITH BE IT DONE TO YOU

 AND THEIR EYES WERE OPENED

AND JESUS STERNLY WARNED THEM SEE THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT

 BUT THEY WENT AWAY AND SPREAD HIS FAME THROUGH ALL THAT DISTRICT

AS THEY WERE GOING AWAY BEHOLD A DEMONOPPRESSED MAN WHO WAS MUTE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM

AND WHEN THE DEMON HAD BEEN CAST OUT THE MUTE MAN SPOKE

AND THE CROWDS MARVELED SAYING NEVER WAS ANYTHING LIKE THIS SEEN IN ISRAEL

 BUT THE PHARISEES SAID HE CASTS OUT DEMONS BY THE PRINCE OF DEMONS

 AND JESUS WENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE CITIES AND VILLAGES TEACHING IN THEIR SYNAGOGUES AND PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM AND HEALING EVERY DISEASE AND EVERY AFFLICTION

WHEN HE SAW THE CROWDS HE HAD COMPASSION FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE HARASSED AND HELPLESS LIKE SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD

THEN HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES THE HARVEST IS PLENTIFUL BUT THE LABORERS ARE FEW; THEREFORE PRAY EARNESTLY TO THE LORD OF THE HARVEST TO SEND OUT LABORERS INTO HIS HARVEST

AND HE CALLED TO HIM HIS TWELVE DISCIPLES AND GAVE THEM AUTHORITY OVER UNCLEAN SPIRITS TO CAST THEM OUT AND TO HEAL EVERY DISEASE AND EVERY AFFLICTION

THE NAMES OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES ARE THESE FIRST SIMON WHO IS CALLED PETER AND ANDREW HIS BROTHER; JAMES THE SON OF ZEBEDEE AND JOHN HIS BROTHER; PHILIP AND BARTHOLOMEW; THOMAS AND MATTHEW THE TAX COLLECTOR; JAMES THE SON OF ALPHAEUS AND THADDAEUS; SIMON THE CANANAEAN AND JUDAS ISCARIOT WHO BETRAYED HIM

THESE TWELVE JESUS SENT OUT INSTRUCTING THEM GO NOWHERE AMONG THE GENTILES AND ENTER NO TOWN OF THE SAMARITANS BUT GO RATHER TO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AND PROCLAIM AS YOU GO SAYING 'THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND

' HEAL THE SICK RAISE THE DEAD CLEANSE LEPERS CAST OUT DEMONS

YOU RECEIVED WITHOUT PAYING; GIVE WITHOUT PAY

ACQUIRE NO GOLD NOR SILVER NOR COPPER FOR YOUR BELTS NO BAG FOR YOUR JOURNEY NOR TWO TUNICS NOR SANDALS NOR A STAFF FOR THE LABORER DESERVES HIS FOOD

AND WHATEVER TOWN OR VILLAGE YOU ENTER FIND OUT WHO IS WORTHY IN IT AND STAY THERE UNTIL YOU DEPART

AS YOU ENTER THE HOUSE GREET IT

AND IF THE HOUSE IS WORTHY LET YOUR PEACE COME UPON IT BUT IF IT IS NOT WORTHY LET YOUR PEACE RETURN TO YOU

AND IF ANYONE WILL NOT RECEIVE YOU OR LISTEN TO YOUR WORDS SHAKE OFF THE DUST FROM YOUR FEET WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT HOUSE OR TOWN

TRULY I SAY TO YOU IT WILL BE MORE BEARABLE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT FOR THE LAND OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH THAN FOR THAT TOWN

BEHOLD I AM SENDING YOU OUT AS SHEEP IN THE MIDST OF WOLVES SO BE WISE AS SERPENTS AND INNOCENT AS DOVES

BEWARE OF MEN FOR THEY WILL DELIVER YOU OVER TO COURTS AND FLOG YOU IN THEIR SYNAGOGUES AND YOU WILL BE DRAGGED BEFORE GOVERNORS AND KINGS FOR MY SAKE TO BEAR WITNESS BEFORE THEM AND THE GENTILES

WHEN THEY DELIVER YOU OVER DO NOT BE ANXIOUS HOW YOU ARE TO SPEAK OR WHAT YOU ARE TO SAY FOR WHAT YOU ARE TO SAY WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU IN THAT HOUR

FOR IT IS NOT YOU WHO SPEAK BUT THE SPIRIT OF YOUR FATHER SPEAKING THROUGH YOU

BROTHER WILL DELIVER BROTHER OVER TO DEATH AND THE FATHER HIS CHILD AND CHILDREN WILL RISE AGAINST PARENTS AND HAVE THEM PUT TO DEATH AND YOU WILL BE HATED BY ALL FOR MY NAME'S SAKE

BUT THE ONE WHO ENDURES TO THE END WILL BE SAVED

WHEN THEY PERSECUTE YOU IN ONE TOWN FLEE TO THE NEXT FOR TRULY I SAY TO YOU YOU WILL NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL THE TOWNS OF ISRAEL BEFORE THE SON OF MAN COMES

A DISCIPLE IS NOT ABOVE HIS TEACHER NOR A SERVANT ABOVE HIS MASTER

IT IS ENOUGH FOR THE DISCIPLE TO BE LIKE HIS TEACHER AND THE SERVANT LIKE HIS MASTER

IF THEY HAVE CALLED THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BEELZEBUL HOW MUCH MORE WILL THEY MALIGN THOSE OF HIS HOUSEHOLD

SO HAVE NO FEAR OF THEM FOR NOTHING IS COVERED THAT WILL NOT BE REVEALED OR HIDDEN THAT WILL NOT BE KNOWN

WHAT I TELL YOU IN THE DARK SAY IN THE LIGHT AND WHAT YOU HEAR WHISPERED PROCLAIM ON THE HOUSETOPS

AND DO NOT FEAR THOSE WHO KILL THE BODY BUT CANNOT KILL THE SOUL

RATHER FEAR HIM WHO CAN DESTROY BOTH SOUL AND BODY IN HELL

ARE NOT TWO SPARROWS SOLD FOR A PENNY

AND NOT ONE OF THEM WILL FALL TO THE GROUND APART FROM YOUR FATHER

BUT EVEN THE HAIRS OF YOUR HEAD ARE ALL NUMBERED

FEAR NOT THEREFORE; YOU ARE OF MORE VALUE THAN MANY SPARROWS

SO EVERYONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGES ME BEFORE MEN I ALSO WILL ACKNOWLEDGE BEFORE MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN BUT WHOEVER DENIES ME BEFORE MEN I ALSO WILL DENY BEFORE MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE COME TO BRING PEACE TO THE EARTH

I HAVE NOT COME TO BRING PEACE BUT A SWORD

FOR I HAVE COME TO SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER AND A DAUGHTERINLAW AGAINST HER MOTHERINLAW

AND A PERSON'S ENEMIES WILL BE THOSE OF HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD

WHOEVER LOVES FATHER OR MOTHER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME AND WHOEVER LOVES SON OR DAUGHTER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME

AND WHOEVER DOES NOT TAKE HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME

WHOEVER FINDS HIS LIFE WILL LOSE IT AND WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE FOR MY SAKE WILL FIND IT

WHOEVER RECEIVES YOU RECEIVES ME AND WHOEVER RECEIVES ME RECEIVES HIM WHO SENT ME

THE ONE WHO RECEIVES A PROPHET BECAUSE HE IS A PROPHET WILL RECEIVE A PROPHET'S REWARD AND THE ONE WHO RECEIVES A RIGHTEOUS PERSON BECAUSE HE IS A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WILL RECEIVE A RIGHTEOUS PERSON'S REWARD

AND WHOEVER GIVES ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES EVEN A CUP OF COLD WATER BECAUSE HE IS A DISCIPLE TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE WILL BY NO MEANS LOSE HIS REWARD

WHEN JESUS HAD FINISHED INSTRUCTING HIS TWELVE DISCIPLES HE WENT ON FROM THERE TO TEACH AND PREACH IN THEIR CITIES

NOW WHEN JOHN HEARD IN PRISON ABOUT THE DEEDS OF THE CHRIST HE SENT WORD BY HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID TO HIM ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS TO COME OR SHALL WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM GO AND TELL JOHN WHAT YOU HEAR AND SEE THE BLIND RECEIVE THEIR SIGHT AND THE LAME WALK LEPERS ARE CLEANSED AND THE DEAF HEAR AND THE DEAD ARE RAISED UP AND THE POOR HAVE GOOD NEWS PREACHED TO THEM

AND BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS NOT OFFENDED BY ME

 AS THEY WENT AWAY JESUS BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THE CROWDS CONCERNING JOHN WHAT DID YOU GO OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO SEE

A REED SHAKEN BY THE WIND

WHAT THEN DID YOU GO OUT TO SEE

A MAN DRESSED IN SOFT CLOTHING

BEHOLD THOSE WHO WEAR SOFT CLOTHING ARE IN KINGS' HOUSES

WHAT THEN DID YOU GO OUT TO SEE

A PROPHET

YES I TELL YOU AND MORE THAN A PROPHET

THIS IS HE OF WHOM IT IS WRITTEN 'BEHOLD I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU

' TRULY I SAY TO YOU AMONG THOSE BORN OF WOMEN THERE HAS ARISEN NO ONE GREATER THAN JOHN THE BAPTIST

YET THE ONE WHO IS LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS GREATER THAN HE

FROM THE DAYS OF JOHN THE BAPTIST UNTIL NOW THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HAS SUFFERED VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE

FOR ALL THE PROPHETS AND THE LAW PROPHESIED UNTIL JOHN AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT HE IS ELIJAH WHO IS TO COME

HE WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR

BUT TO WHAT SHALL I COMPARE THIS GENERATION

IT IS LIKE CHILDREN SITTING IN THE MARKETPLACES AND CALLING TO THEIR PLAYMATES 'WE PLAYED THE FLUTE FOR YOU AND YOU DID NOT DANCE; WE SANG A DIRGE AND YOU DID NOT MOURN

' FOR JOHN CAME NEITHER EATING NOR DRINKING AND THEY SAY 'HE HAS A DEMON

' THE SON OF MAN CAME EATING AND DRINKING AND THEY SAY 'LOOK AT HIM

A GLUTTON AND A DRUNKARD A FRIEND OF TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS

' YET WISDOM IS JUSTIFIED BY HER DEEDS

 THEN HE BEGAN TO DENOUNCE THE CITIES WHERE MOST OF HIS MIGHTY WORKS HAD BEEN DONE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT REPENT

WOE TO YOU CHORAZIN

WOE TO YOU BETHSAIDA

FOR IF THE MIGHTY WORKS DONE IN YOU HAD BEEN DONE IN TYRE AND SIDON THEY WOULD HAVE REPENTED LONG AGO IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES

BUT I TELL YOU IT WILL BE MORE BEARABLE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT FOR TYRE AND SIDON THAN FOR YOU

AND YOU CAPERNAUM WILL YOU BE EXALTED TO HEAVEN

YOU WILL BE BROUGHT DOWN TO HADES

FOR IF THE MIGHTY WORKS DONE IN YOU HAD BEEN DONE IN SODOM IT WOULD HAVE REMAINED UNTIL THIS DAY

BUT I TELL YOU THAT IT WILL BE MORE TOLERABLE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT FOR THE LAND OF SODOM THAN FOR YOU

 AT THAT TIME JESUS DECLARED I THANK YOU FATHER LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND UNDERSTANDING AND REVEALED THEM TO LITTLE CHILDREN; YES FATHER FOR SUCH WAS YOUR GRACIOUS WILL

ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO ME BY MY FATHER AND NO ONE KNOWS THE SON EXCEPT THE FATHER AND NO ONE KNOWS THE FATHER EXCEPT THE SON AND ANYONE TO WHOM THE SON CHOOSES TO REVEAL HIM

COME TO ME ALL WHO LABOR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST

TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU AND LEARN FROM ME FOR I AM GENTLE AND LOWLY IN HEART AND YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS

FOR MY YOKE IS EASY AND MY BURDEN IS LIGHT

AT THAT TIME JESUS WENT THROUGH THE GRAINFIELDS ON THE SABBATH

HIS DISCIPLES WERE HUNGRY AND THEY BEGAN TO PLUCK HEADS OF GRAIN AND TO EAT

BUT WHEN THE PHARISEES SAW IT THEY SAID TO HIM LOOK YOUR DISCIPLES ARE DOING WHAT IS NOT LAWFUL TO DO ON THE SABBATH

 HE SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU NOT READ WHAT DAVID DID WHEN HE WAS HUNGRY AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM HOW HE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF GOD AND ATE THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE WHICH IT WAS NOT LAWFUL FOR HIM TO EAT NOR FOR THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM BUT ONLY FOR THE PRIESTS

OR HAVE YOU NOT READ IN THE LAW HOW ON THE SABBATH THE PRIESTS IN THE TEMPLE PROFANE THE SABBATH AND ARE GUILTLESS

I TELL YOU SOMETHING GREATER THAN THE TEMPLE IS HERE

AND IF YOU HAD KNOWN WHAT THIS MEANS 'I DESIRE MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE' YOU WOULD NOT HAVE CONDEMNED THE GUILTLESS

FOR THE SON OF MAN IS LORD OF THE SABBATH

 HE WENT ON FROM THERE AND ENTERED THEIR SYNAGOGUE

AND A MAN WAS THERE WITH A WITHERED HAND

AND THEY ASKED HIM IS IT LAWFUL TO HEAL ON THE SABBATH

SO THAT THEY MIGHT ACCUSE HIM

HE SAID TO THEM WHICH ONE OF YOU WHO HAS A SHEEP IF IT FALLS INTO A PIT ON THE SABBATH WILL NOT TAKE HOLD OF IT AND LIFT IT OUT

OF HOW MUCH MORE VALUE IS A MAN THAN A SHEEP

SO IT IS LAWFUL TO DO GOOD ON THE SABBATH

 THEN HE SAID TO THE MAN STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND

 AND THE MAN STRETCHED IT OUT AND IT WAS RESTORED HEALTHY LIKE THE OTHER

BUT THE PHARISEES WENT OUT AND CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM HOW TO DESTROY HIM

JESUS AWARE OF THIS WITHDREW FROM THERE

AND MANY FOLLOWED HIM AND HE HEALED THEM ALL AND ORDERED THEM NOT TO MAKE HIM KNOWN

THIS WAS TO FULFILL WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH BEHOLD MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN MY BELOVED WITH WHOM MY SOUL IS WELL PLEASED

I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM AND HE WILL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES

HE WILL NOT QUARREL OR CRY ALOUD NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS; A BRUISED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT QUENCH UNTIL HE BRINGS JUSTICE TO VICTORY; AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE

 THEN A DEMONOPPRESSED MAN WHO WAS BLIND AND MUTE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AND HE HEALED HIM SO THAT THE MAN SPOKE AND SAW

AND ALL THE PEOPLE WERE AMAZED AND SAID CAN THIS BE THE SON OF DAVID

 BUT WHEN THE PHARISEES HEARD IT THEY SAID IT IS ONLY BY BEELZEBUL THE PRINCE OF DEMONS THAT THIS MAN CASTS OUT DEMONS

 KNOWING THEIR THOUGHTS HE SAID TO THEM EVERY KINGDOM DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF IS LAID WASTE AND NO CITY OR HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WILL STAND

AND IF SATAN CASTS OUT SATAN HE IS DIVIDED AGAINST HIMSELF

HOW THEN WILL HIS KINGDOM STAND

AND IF I CAST OUT DEMONS BY BEELZEBUL BY WHOM DO YOUR SONS CAST THEM OUT

THEREFORE THEY WILL BE YOUR JUDGES

BUT IF IT IS BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT I CAST OUT DEMONS THEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD HAS COME UPON YOU

OR HOW CAN SOMEONE ENTER A STRONG MAN'S HOUSE AND PLUNDER HIS GOODS UNLESS HE FIRST BINDS THE STRONG MAN

THEN INDEED HE MAY PLUNDER HIS HOUSE

WHOEVER IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME AND WHOEVER DOES NOT GATHER WITH ME SCATTERS

THEREFORE I TELL YOU EVERY SIN AND BLASPHEMY WILL BE FORGIVEN PEOPLE BUT THE BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE SPIRIT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN

AND WHOEVER SPEAKS A WORD AGAINST THE SON OF MAN WILL BE FORGIVEN BUT WHOEVER SPEAKS AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN EITHER IN THIS AGE OR IN THE AGE TO COME

EITHER MAKE THE TREE GOOD AND ITS FRUIT GOOD OR MAKE THE TREE BAD AND ITS FRUIT BAD FOR THE TREE IS KNOWN BY ITS FRUIT

YOU BROOD OF VIPERS

HOW CAN YOU SPEAK GOOD WHEN YOU ARE EVIL

FOR OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKS

THE GOOD PERSON OUT OF HIS GOOD TREASURE BRINGS FORTH GOOD AND THE EVIL PERSON OUT OF HIS EVIL TREASURE BRINGS FORTH EVIL

I TELL YOU ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT PEOPLE WILL GIVE ACCOUNT FOR EVERY CARELESS WORD THEY SPEAK FOR BY YOUR WORDS YOU WILL BE JUSTIFIED AND BY YOUR WORDS YOU WILL BE CONDEMNED

 THEN SOME OF THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES ANSWERED HIM SAYING TEACHER WE WISH TO SEE A SIGN FROM YOU

 BUT HE ANSWERED THEM AN EVIL AND ADULTEROUS GENERATION SEEKS FOR A SIGN BUT NO SIGN WILL BE GIVEN TO IT EXCEPT THE SIGN OF THE PROPHET JONAH

FOR JUST AS JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE GREAT FISH SO WILL THE SON OF MAN BE THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH

THE MEN OF NINEVEH WILL RISE UP AT THE JUDGMENT WITH THIS GENERATION AND CONDEMN IT FOR THEY REPENTED AT THE PREACHING OF JONAH AND BEHOLD SOMETHING GREATER THAN JONAH IS HERE

THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH WILL RISE UP AT THE JUDGMENT WITH THIS GENERATION AND CONDEMN IT FOR SHE CAME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO HEAR THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON AND BEHOLD SOMETHING GREATER THAN SOLOMON IS HERE

WHEN THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT HAS GONE OUT OF A PERSON IT PASSES THROUGH WATERLESS PLACES SEEKING REST BUT FINDS NONE

THEN IT SAYS 'I WILL RETURN TO MY HOUSE FROM WHICH I CAME

' AND WHEN IT COMES IT FINDS THE HOUSE EMPTY SWEPT AND PUT IN ORDER

THEN IT GOES AND BRINGS WITH IT SEVEN OTHER SPIRITS MORE EVIL THAN ITSELF AND THEY ENTER AND DWELL THERE AND THE LAST STATE OF THAT PERSON IS WORSE THAN THE FIRST

SO ALSO WILL IT BE WITH THIS EVIL GENERATION

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE BEHOLD HIS MOTHER AND HIS BROTHERS STOOD OUTSIDE ASKING TO SPEAK TO HIM

BUT HE REPLIED TO THE MAN WHO TOLD HIM WHO IS MY MOTHER AND WHO ARE MY BROTHERS

 AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TOWARD HIS DISCIPLES HE SAID HERE ARE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS

FOR WHOEVER DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER IN HEAVEN IS MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND MOTHER

THAT SAME DAY JESUS WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SAT BESIDE THE SEA

AND GREAT CROWDS GATHERED ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE GOT INTO A BOAT AND SAT DOWN

AND THE WHOLE CROWD STOOD ON THE BEACH

AND HE TOLD THEM MANY THINGS IN PARABLES SAYING A SOWER WENT OUT TO SOW

AND AS HE SOWED SOME SEEDS FELL ALONG THE PATH AND THE BIRDS CAME AND DEVOURED THEM

OTHER SEEDS FELL ON ROCKY GROUND WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH SOIL AND IMMEDIATELY THEY SPRANG UP SINCE THEY HAD NO DEPTH OF SOIL BUT WHEN THE SUN ROSE THEY WERE SCORCHED

AND SINCE THEY HAD NO ROOT THEY WITHERED AWAY

OTHER SEEDS FELL AMONG THORNS AND THE THORNS GREW UP AND CHOKED THEM

OTHER SEEDS FELL ON GOOD SOIL AND PRODUCED GRAIN SOME A HUNDREDFOLD SOME SIXTY SOME THIRTY

HE WHO HAS EARS LET HIM HEAR

 THEN THE DISCIPLES CAME AND SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU SPEAK TO THEM IN PARABLES

 AND HE ANSWERED THEM TO YOU IT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO KNOW THE SECRETS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BUT TO THEM IT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN

FOR TO THE ONE WHO HAS MORE WILL BE GIVEN AND HE WILL HAVE AN ABUNDANCE BUT FROM THE ONE WHO HAS NOT EVEN WHAT HE HAS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY

THIS IS WHY I SPEAK TO THEM IN PARABLES BECAUSE SEEING THEY DO NOT SEE AND HEARING THEY DO NOT HEAR NOR DO THEY UNDERSTAND

INDEED IN THEIR CASE THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH IS FULFILLED THAT SAYS 'YOU WILL INDEED HEAR BUT NEVER UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL INDEED SEE BUT NEVER PERCEIVE

FOR THIS PEOPLE'S HEART HAS GROWN DULL AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY CAN BARELY HEAR AND THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED LEST THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND TURN AND I WOULD HEAL THEM

' BUT BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES FOR THEY SEE AND YOUR EARS FOR THEY HEAR

TRULY I SAY TO YOU MANY PROPHETS AND RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE LONGED TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AND DID NOT SEE IT AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR AND DID NOT HEAR IT

HEAR THEN THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER WHEN ANYONE HEARS THE WORD OF THE KINGDOM AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND IT THE EVIL ONE COMES AND SNATCHES AWAY WHAT HAS BEEN SOWN IN HIS HEART

THIS IS WHAT WAS SOWN ALONG THE PATH

AS FOR WHAT WAS SOWN ON ROCKY GROUND THIS IS THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORD AND IMMEDIATELY RECEIVES IT WITH JOY YET HE HAS NO ROOT IN HIMSELF BUT ENDURES FOR A WHILE AND WHEN TRIBULATION OR PERSECUTION ARISES ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD IMMEDIATELY HE FALLS AWAY

AS FOR WHAT WAS SOWN AMONG THORNS THIS IS THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORD BUT THE CARES OF THE WORLD AND THE DECEITFULNESS OF RICHES CHOKE THE WORD AND IT PROVES UNFRUITFUL

AS FOR WHAT WAS SOWN ON GOOD SOIL THIS IS THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORD AND UNDERSTANDS IT

HE INDEED BEARS FRUIT AND YIELDS IN ONE CASE A HUNDREDFOLD IN ANOTHER SIXTY AND IN ANOTHER THIRTY

 HE PUT ANOTHER PARABLE BEFORE THEM SAYING THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MAY BE COMPARED TO A MAN WHO SOWED GOOD SEED IN HIS FIELD BUT WHILE HIS MEN WERE SLEEPING HIS ENEMY CAME AND SOWED WEEDS AMONG THE WHEAT AND WENT AWAY

SO WHEN THE PLANTS CAME UP AND BORE GRAIN THEN THE WEEDS APPEARED ALSO

AND THE SERVANTS OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE CAME AND SAID TO HIM 'MASTER DID YOU NOT SOW GOOD SEED IN YOUR FIELD

HOW THEN DOES IT HAVE WEEDS

' HE SAID TO THEM 'AN ENEMY HAS DONE THIS

' SO THE SERVANTS SAID TO HIM 'THEN DO YOU WANT US TO GO AND GATHER THEM

' BUT HE SAID 'NO LEST IN GATHERING THE WEEDS YOU ROOT UP THE WHEAT ALONG WITH THEM

LET BOTH GROW TOGETHER UNTIL THE HARVEST AND AT HARVEST TIME I WILL TELL THE REAPERS GATHER THE WEEDS FIRST AND BIND THEM IN BUNDLES TO BE BURNED BUT GATHER THE WHEAT INTO MY BARN

' HE PUT ANOTHER PARABLE BEFORE THEM SAYING THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED THAT A MAN TOOK AND SOWED IN HIS FIELD

IT IS THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS BUT WHEN IT HAS GROWN IT IS LARGER THAN ALL THE GARDEN PLANTS AND BECOMES A TREE SO THAT THE BIRDS OF THE AIR COME AND MAKE NESTS IN ITS BRANCHES

 HE TOLD THEM ANOTHER PARABLE

THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE LEAVEN THAT A WOMAN TOOK AND HID IN THREE MEASURES OF FLOUR TILL IT WAS ALL LEAVENED

 ALL THESE THINGS JESUS SAID TO THE CROWDS IN PARABLES; INDEED HE SAID NOTHING TO THEM WITHOUT A PARABLE

THIS WAS TO FULFILL WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER WHAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD

 THEN HE LEFT THE CROWDS AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE

AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME TO HIM SAYING EXPLAIN TO US THE PARABLE OF THE WEEDS OF THE FIELD

 HE ANSWERED THE ONE WHO SOWS THE GOOD SEED IS THE SON OF MAN

THE FIELD IS THE WORLD AND THE GOOD SEED IS THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM

THE WEEDS ARE THE SONS OF THE EVIL ONE AND THE ENEMY WHO SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL

THE HARVEST IS THE CLOSE OF THE AGE AND THE REAPERS ARE ANGELS

JUST AS THE WEEDS ARE GATHERED AND BURNED WITH FIRE SO WILL IT BE AT THE CLOSE OF THE AGE

THE SON OF MAN WILL SEND HIS ANGELS AND THEY WILL GATHER OUT OF HIS KINGDOM ALL CAUSES OF SIN AND ALL LAWBREAKERS AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIERY FURNACE

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

THEN THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE LIKE THE SUN IN THE KINGDOM OF THEIR FATHER

HE WHO HAS EARS LET HIM HEAR

THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE TREASURE HIDDEN IN A FIELD WHICH A MAN FOUND AND COVERED UP

THEN IN HIS JOY HE GOES AND SELLS ALL THAT HE HAS AND BUYS THAT FIELD

AGAIN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE A MERCHANT IN SEARCH OF FINE PEARLS WHO ON FINDING ONE PEARL OF GREAT VALUE WENT AND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND BOUGHT IT

AGAIN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE A NET THAT WAS THROWN INTO THE SEA AND GATHERED FISH OF EVERY KIND

WHEN IT WAS FULL MEN DREW IT ASHORE AND SAT DOWN AND SORTED THE GOOD INTO CONTAINERS BUT THREW AWAY THE BAD

SO IT WILL BE AT THE CLOSE OF THE AGE

THE ANGELS WILL COME OUT AND SEPARATE THE EVIL FROM THE RIGHTEOUS AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIERY FURNACE

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD ALL THESE THINGS

 THEY SAID TO HIM YES

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THEREFORE EVERY SCRIBE WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE A MASTER OF A HOUSE WHO BRINGS OUT OF HIS TREASURE WHAT IS NEW AND WHAT IS OLD

 AND WHEN JESUS HAD FINISHED THESE PARABLES HE WENT AWAY FROM THERE AND COMING TO HIS HOMETOWN HE TAUGHT THEM IN THEIR SYNAGOGUE SO THAT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID WHERE DID THIS MAN GET THIS WISDOM AND THESE MIGHTY WORKS

IS NOT THIS THE CARPENTER'S SON

IS NOT HIS MOTHER CALLED MARY

AND ARE NOT HIS BROTHERS JAMES AND JOSEPH AND SIMON AND JUDAS

AND ARE NOT ALL HIS SISTERS WITH US

WHERE THEN DID THIS MAN GET ALL THESE THINGS

 AND THEY TOOK OFFENSE AT HIM

BUT JESUS SAID TO THEM A PROPHET IS NOT WITHOUT HONOR EXCEPT IN HIS HOMETOWN AND IN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD

 AND HE DID NOT DO MANY MIGHTY WORKS THERE BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF

AT THAT TIME HEROD THE TETRARCH HEARD ABOUT THE FAME OF JESUS AND HE SAID TO HIS SERVANTS THIS IS JOHN THE BAPTIST

HE HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD; THAT IS WHY THESE MIRACULOUS POWERS ARE AT WORK IN HIM

 FOR HEROD HAD SEIZED JOHN AND BOUND HIM AND PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR THE SAKE OF HERODIAS HIS BROTHER PHILIP'S WIFE BECAUSE JOHN HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIM IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO HAVE HER

 AND THOUGH HE WANTED TO PUT HIM TO DEATH HE FEARED THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HELD HIM TO BE A PROPHET

BUT WHEN HEROD'S BIRTHDAY CAME THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS DANCED BEFORE THE COMPANY AND PLEASED HEROD SO THAT HE PROMISED WITH AN OATH TO GIVE HER WHATEVER SHE MIGHT ASK

PROMPTED BY HER MOTHER SHE SAID GIVE ME THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST HERE ON A PLATTER

 AND THE KING WAS SORRY BUT BECAUSE OF HIS OATHS AND HIS GUESTS HE COMMANDED IT TO BE GIVEN

HE SENT AND HAD JOHN BEHEADED IN THE PRISON AND HIS HEAD WAS BROUGHT ON A PLATTER AND GIVEN TO THE GIRL AND SHE BROUGHT IT TO HER MOTHER

AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND TOOK THE BODY AND BURIED IT AND THEY WENT AND TOLD JESUS

NOW WHEN JESUS HEARD THIS HE WITHDREW FROM THERE IN A BOAT TO A DESOLATE PLACE BY HIMSELF

BUT WHEN THE CROWDS HEARD IT THEY FOLLOWED HIM ON FOOT FROM THE TOWNS

WHEN HE WENT ASHORE HE SAW A GREAT CROWD AND HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM AND HEALED THEIR SICK

NOW WHEN IT WAS EVENING THE DISCIPLES CAME TO HIM AND SAID THIS IS A DESOLATE PLACE AND THE DAY IS NOW OVER; SEND THE CROWDS AWAY TO GO INTO THE VILLAGES AND BUY FOOD FOR THEMSELVES

 BUT JESUS SAID THEY NEED NOT GO AWAY; YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT

 THEY SAID TO HIM WE HAVE ONLY FIVE LOAVES HERE AND TWO FISH

 AND HE SAID BRING THEM HERE TO ME

 THEN HE ORDERED THE CROWDS TO SIT DOWN ON THE GRASS AND TAKING THE FIVE LOAVES AND THE TWO FISH HE LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND SAID A BLESSING

THEN HE BROKE THE LOAVES AND GAVE THEM TO THE DISCIPLES AND THE DISCIPLES GAVE THEM TO THE CROWDS

AND THEY ALL ATE AND WERE SATISFIED

AND THEY TOOK UP TWELVE BASKETS FULL OF THE BROKEN PIECES LEFT OVER

AND THOSE WHO ATE WERE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MEN BESIDES WOMEN AND CHILDREN

IMMEDIATELY HE MADE THE DISCIPLES GET INTO THE BOAT AND GO BEFORE HIM TO THE OTHER SIDE WHILE HE DISMISSED THE CROWDS

AND AFTER HE HAD DISMISSED THE CROWDS HE WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN BY HIMSELF TO PRAY

WHEN EVENING CAME HE WAS THERE ALONE BUT THE BOAT BY THIS TIME WAS A LONG WAY FROM THE LAND BEATEN BY THE WAVES FOR THE WIND WAS AGAINST THEM

AND IN THE FOURTH WATCH OF THE NIGHT HE CAME TO THEM WALKING ON THE SEA

BUT WHEN THE DISCIPLES SAW HIM WALKING ON THE SEA THEY WERE TERRIFIED AND SAID IT IS A GHOST

 AND THEY CRIED OUT IN FEAR

BUT IMMEDIATELY JESUS SPOKE TO THEM SAYING TAKE HEART; IT IS I

DO NOT BE AFRAID

 AND PETER ANSWERED HIM LORD IF IT IS YOU COMMAND ME TO COME TO YOU ON THE WATER

 HE SAID COME

 SO PETER GOT OUT OF THE BOAT AND WALKED ON THE WATER AND CAME TO JESUS

BUT WHEN HE SAW THE WIND HE WAS AFRAID AND BEGINNING TO SINK HE CRIED OUT LORD SAVE ME

 JESUS IMMEDIATELY REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK HOLD OF HIM SAYING TO HIM O YOU OF LITTLE FAITH WHY DID YOU DOUBT

 AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE BOAT THE WIND CEASED

AND THOSE IN THE BOAT WORSHIPED HIM SAYING TRULY YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD

 AND WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED OVER THEY CAME TO LAND AT GENNESARET

AND WHEN THE MEN OF THAT PLACE RECOGNIZED HIM THEY SENT AROUND TO ALL THAT REGION AND BROUGHT TO HIM ALL WHO WERE SICK AND IMPLORED HIM THAT THEY MIGHT ONLY TOUCH THE FRINGE OF HIS GARMENT

AND AS MANY AS TOUCHED IT WERE MADE WELL

THEN PHARISEES AND SCRIBES CAME TO JESUS FROM JERUSALEM AND SAID WHY DO YOUR DISCIPLES BREAK THE TRADITION OF THE ELDERS

FOR THEY DO NOT WASH THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY EAT

 HE ANSWERED THEM AND WHY DO YOU BREAK THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR TRADITION

FOR GOD COMMANDED 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER' AND 'WHOEVER REVILES FATHER OR MOTHER MUST SURELY DIE

' BUT YOU SAY 'IF ANYONE TELLS HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE GAINED FROM ME IS GIVEN TO GOD HE NEED NOT HONOR HIS FATHER

' SO FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR TRADITION YOU HAVE MADE VOID THE WORD OF GOD

YOU HYPOCRITES

WELL DID ISAIAH PROPHESY OF YOU WHEN HE SAID 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM ME; IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN

' AND HE CALLED THE PEOPLE TO HIM AND SAID TO THEM HEAR AND UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT WHAT GOES INTO THE MOUTH THAT DEFILES A PERSON BUT WHAT COMES OUT OF THE MOUTH; THIS DEFILES A PERSON

 THEN THE DISCIPLES CAME AND SAID TO HIM DO YOU KNOW THAT THE PHARISEES WERE OFFENDED WHEN THEY HEARD THIS SAYING

 HE ANSWERED EVERY PLANT THAT MY HEAVENLY FATHER HAS NOT PLANTED WILL BE ROOTED UP

LET THEM ALONE; THEY ARE BLIND GUIDES

AND IF THE BLIND LEAD THE BLIND BOTH WILL FALL INTO A PIT

 BUT PETER SAID TO HIM EXPLAIN THE PARABLE TO US

 AND HE SAID ARE YOU ALSO STILL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

DO YOU NOT SEE THAT WHATEVER GOES INTO THE MOUTH PASSES INTO THE STOMACH AND IS EXPELLED

BUT WHAT COMES OUT OF THE MOUTH PROCEEDS FROM THE HEART AND THIS DEFILES A PERSON

FOR OUT OF THE HEART COME EVIL THOUGHTS MURDER ADULTERY SEXUAL IMMORALITY THEFT FALSE WITNESS SLANDER

THESE ARE WHAT DEFILE A PERSON

BUT TO EAT WITH UNWASHED HANDS DOES NOT DEFILE ANYONE

 AND JESUS WENT AWAY FROM THERE AND WITHDREW TO THE DISTRICT OF TYRE AND SIDON

AND BEHOLD A CANAANITE WOMAN FROM THAT REGION CAME OUT AND WAS CRYING HAVE MERCY ON ME O LORD SON OF DAVID; MY DAUGHTER IS SEVERELY OPPRESSED BY A DEMON

 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER HER A WORD

AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND BEGGED HIM SAYING SEND HER AWAY FOR SHE IS CRYING OUT AFTER US

 HE ANSWERED I WAS SENT ONLY TO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

 BUT SHE CAME AND KNELT BEFORE HIM SAYING LORD HELP ME

 AND HE ANSWERED IT IS NOT RIGHT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND THROW IT TO THE DOGS

 SHE SAID YES LORD YET EVEN THE DOGS EAT THE CRUMBS THAT FALL FROM THEIR MASTERS' TABLE

 THEN JESUS ANSWERED HER O WOMAN GREAT IS YOUR FAITH

BE IT DONE FOR YOU AS YOU DESIRE

 AND HER DAUGHTER WAS HEALED INSTANTLY

JESUS WENT ON FROM THERE AND WALKED BESIDE THE SEA OF GALILEE

AND HE WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND SAT DOWN THERE

AND GREAT CROWDS CAME TO HIM BRINGING WITH THEM THE LAME THE BLIND THE CRIPPLED THE MUTE AND MANY OTHERS AND THEY PUT THEM AT HIS FEET AND HE HEALED THEM SO THAT THE CROWD WONDERED WHEN THEY SAW THE MUTE SPEAKING THE CRIPPLED HEALTHY THE LAME WALKING AND THE BLIND SEEING

AND THEY GLORIFIED THE GOD OF ISRAEL

THEN JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I HAVE COMPASSION ON THE CROWD BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WITH ME NOW THREE DAYS AND HAVE NOTHING TO EAT

AND I AM UNWILLING TO SEND THEM AWAY HUNGRY LEST THEY FAINT ON THE WAY

 AND THE DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM WHERE ARE WE TO GET ENOUGH BREAD IN SUCH A DESOLATE PLACE TO FEED SO GREAT A CROWD

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM HOW MANY LOAVES DO YOU HAVE

 THEY SAID SEVEN AND A FEW SMALL FISH

 AND DIRECTING THE CROWD TO SIT DOWN ON THE GROUND HE TOOK THE SEVEN LOAVES AND THE FISH AND HAVING GIVEN THANKS HE BROKE THEM AND GAVE THEM TO THE DISCIPLES AND THE DISCIPLES GAVE THEM TO THE CROWDS

AND THEY ALL ATE AND WERE SATISFIED

AND THEY TOOK UP SEVEN BASKETS FULL OF THE BROKEN PIECES LEFT OVER

THOSE WHO ATE WERE FOUR THOUSAND MEN BESIDES WOMEN AND CHILDREN

AND AFTER SENDING AWAY THE CROWDS HE GOT INTO THE BOAT AND WENT TO THE REGION OF MAGADAN

AND THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES CAME AND TO TEST HIM THEY ASKED HIM TO SHOW THEM A SIGN FROM HEAVEN

HE ANSWERED THEM WHEN IT IS EVENING YOU SAY 'IT WILL BE FAIR WEATHER FOR THE SKY IS RED

' AND IN THE MORNING 'IT WILL BE STORMY TODAY FOR THE SKY IS RED AND THREATENING

' YOU KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THE APPEARANCE OF THE SKY BUT YOU CANNOT INTERPRET THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES

AN EVIL AND ADULTEROUS GENERATION SEEKS FOR A SIGN BUT NO SIGN WILL BE GIVEN TO IT EXCEPT THE SIGN OF JONAH

 SO HE LEFT THEM AND DEPARTED

WHEN THE DISCIPLES REACHED THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO BRING ANY BREAD

JESUS SAID TO THEM WATCH AND BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES

 AND THEY BEGAN DISCUSSING IT AMONG THEMSELVES SAYING WE BROUGHT NO BREAD

 BUT JESUS AWARE OF THIS SAID O YOU OF LITTLE FAITH WHY ARE YOU DISCUSSING AMONG YOURSELVES THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NO BREAD

DO YOU NOT YET PERCEIVE

DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THE FIVE LOAVES FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND AND HOW MANY BASKETS YOU GATHERED

OR THE SEVEN LOAVES FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND AND HOW MANY BASKETS YOU GATHERED

HOW IS IT THAT YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THAT I DID NOT SPEAK ABOUT BREAD

BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES

 THEN THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE DID NOT TELL THEM TO BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF BREAD BUT OF THE TEACHING OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES

NOW WHEN JESUS CAME INTO THE DISTRICT OF CAESAREA PHILIPPI HE ASKED HIS DISCIPLES WHO DO PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SON OF MAN IS

 AND THEY SAID SOME SAY JOHN THE BAPTIST OTHERS SAY ELIJAH AND OTHERS JEREMIAH OR ONE OF THE PROPHETS

 HE SAID TO THEM BUT WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM

 SIMON PETER REPLIED YOU ARE THE CHRIST THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD

 AND JESUS ANSWERED HIM BLESSED ARE YOU SIMON BARJONAH

FOR FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU BUT MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

AND I TELL YOU YOU ARE PETER AND ON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT

I WILL GIVE YOU THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH SHALL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN AND WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH SHALL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN

 THEN HE STRICTLY CHARGED THE DISCIPLES TO TELL NO ONE THAT HE WAS THE CHRIST

FROM THAT TIME JESUS BEGAN TO SHOW HIS DISCIPLES THAT HE MUST GO TO JERUSALEM AND SUFFER MANY THINGS FROM THE ELDERS AND CHIEF PRIESTS AND SCRIBES AND BE KILLED AND ON THE THIRD DAY BE RAISED

AND PETER TOOK HIM ASIDE AND BEGAN TO REBUKE HIM SAYING FAR BE IT FROM YOU LORD

THIS SHALL NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU

 BUT HE TURNED AND SAID TO PETER GET BEHIND ME SATAN

YOU ARE A HINDRANCE TO ME

FOR YOU ARE NOT SETTING YOUR MIND ON THE THINGS OF GOD BUT ON THE THINGS OF MAN

 THEN JESUS TOLD HIS DISCIPLES IF ANYONE WOULD COME AFTER ME LET HIM DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME

FOR WHOEVER WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE WILL LOSE IT BUT WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE FOR MY SAKE WILL FIND IT

FOR WHAT WILL IT PROFIT A MAN IF HE GAINS THE WHOLE WORLD AND FORFEITS HIS LIFE

OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN RETURN FOR HIS LIFE

FOR THE SON OF MAN IS GOING TO COME WITH HIS ANGELS IN THE GLORY OF HIS FATHER AND THEN HE WILL REPAY EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAS DONE

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THERE ARE SOME STANDING HERE WHO WILL NOT TASTE DEATH UNTIL THEY SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING IN HIS KINGDOM

AND AFTER SIX DAYS JESUS TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN HIS BROTHER AND LED THEM UP A HIGH MOUNTAIN BY THEMSELVES

AND HE WAS TRANSFIGURED BEFORE THEM AND HIS FACE SHONE LIKE THE SUN AND HIS CLOTHES BECAME WHITE AS LIGHT

AND BEHOLD THERE APPEARED TO THEM MOSES AND ELIJAH TALKING WITH HIM

AND PETER SAID TO JESUS LORD IT IS GOOD THAT WE ARE HERE

IF YOU WISH I WILL MAKE THREE TENTS HERE ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR MOSES AND ONE FOR ELIJAH

 HE WAS STILL SPEAKING WHEN BEHOLD A BRIGHT CLOUD OVERSHADOWED THEM AND A VOICE FROM THE CLOUD SAID THIS IS MY BELOVED SON WITH WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED; LISTEN TO HIM

 WHEN THE DISCIPLES HEARD THIS THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES AND WERE TERRIFIED

BUT JESUS CAME AND TOUCHED THEM SAYING RISE AND HAVE NO FEAR

 AND WHEN THEY LIFTED UP THEIR EYES THEY SAW NO ONE BUT JESUS ONLY

AND AS THEY WERE COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN JESUS COMMANDED THEM TELL NO ONE THE VISION UNTIL THE SON OF MAN IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD

 AND THE DISCIPLES ASKED HIM THEN WHY DO THE SCRIBES SAY THAT FIRST ELIJAH MUST COME

 HE ANSWERED ELIJAH DOES COME AND HE WILL RESTORE ALL THINGS

BUT I TELL YOU THAT ELIJAH HAS ALREADY COME AND THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BUT DID TO HIM WHATEVER THEY PLEASED

SO ALSO THE SON OF MAN WILL CERTAINLY SUFFER AT THEIR HANDS

 THEN THE DISCIPLES UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS SPEAKING TO THEM OF JOHN THE BAPTIST

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE CROWD A MAN CAME UP TO HIM AND KNEELING BEFORE HIM SAID LORD HAVE MERCY ON MY SON FOR HE IS AN EPILEPTIC AND HE SUFFERS TERRIBLY

FOR OFTEN HE FALLS INTO THE FIRE AND OFTEN INTO THE WATER

AND I BROUGHT HIM TO YOUR DISCIPLES AND THEY COULD NOT HEAL HIM

 AND JESUS ANSWERED O FAITHLESS AND TWISTED GENERATION HOW LONG AM I TO BE WITH YOU

HOW LONG AM I TO BEAR WITH YOU

BRING HIM HERE TO ME

 AND JESUS REBUKED HIM AND THE DEMON CAME OUT OF HIM AND THE BOY WAS HEALED INSTANTLY

THEN THE DISCIPLES CAME TO JESUS PRIVATELY AND SAID WHY COULD WE NOT CAST IT OUT

 HE SAID TO THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR LITTLE FAITH

FOR TRULY I SAY TO YOU IF YOU HAVE FAITH LIKE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED YOU WILL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN 'MOVE FROM HERE TO THERE' AND IT WILL MOVE AND NOTHING WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU

 SEE FOOTNOTE AS THEY WERE GATHERING IN GALILEE JESUS SAID TO THEM THE SON OF MAN IS ABOUT TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF MEN AND THEY WILL KILL HIM AND HE WILL BE RAISED ON THE THIRD DAY

 AND THEY WERE GREATLY DISTRESSED

WHEN THEY CAME TO CAPERNAUM THE COLLECTORS OF THE HALFSHEKEL TAX WENT UP TO PETER AND SAID DOES YOUR TEACHER NOT PAY THE TAX

 HE SAID YES

 AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE JESUS SPOKE TO HIM FIRST SAYING WHAT DO YOU THINK SIMON

FROM WHOM DO KINGS OF THE EARTH TAKE TOLL OR TAX

FROM THEIR SONS OR FROM OTHERS

 AND WHEN HE SAID FROM OTHERS JESUS SAID TO HIM THEN THE SONS ARE FREE

HOWEVER NOT TO GIVE OFFENSE TO THEM GO TO THE SEA AND CAST A HOOK AND TAKE THE FIRST FISH THAT COMES UP AND WHEN YOU OPEN ITS MOUTH YOU WILL FIND A SHEKEL

TAKE THAT AND GIVE IT TO THEM FOR ME AND FOR YOURSELF

AT THAT TIME THE DISCIPLES CAME TO JESUS SAYING WHO IS THE GREATEST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

 AND CALLING TO HIM A CHILD HE PUT HIM IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND SAID TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNLESS YOU TURN AND BECOME LIKE CHILDREN YOU WILL NEVER ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

WHOEVER HUMBLES HIMSELF LIKE THIS CHILD IS THE GREATEST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

WHOEVER RECEIVES ONE SUCH CHILD IN MY NAME RECEIVES ME BUT WHOEVER CAUSES ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES WHO BELIEVE IN ME TO SIN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO HAVE A GREAT MILLSTONE FASTENED AROUND HIS NECK AND TO BE DROWNED IN THE DEPTH OF THE SEA

WOE TO THE WORLD FOR TEMPTATIONS TO SIN

FOR IT IS NECESSARY THAT TEMPTATIONS COME BUT WOE TO THE ONE BY WHOM THE TEMPTATION COMES

AND IF YOUR HAND OR YOUR FOOT CAUSES YOU TO SIN CUT IT OFF AND THROW IT AWAY

IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ENTER LIFE CRIPPLED OR LAME THAN WITH TWO HANDS OR TWO FEET TO BE THROWN INTO THE ETERNAL FIRE

AND IF YOUR EYE CAUSES YOU TO SIN TEAR IT OUT AND THROW IT AWAY

IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ENTER LIFE WITH ONE EYE THAN WITH TWO EYES TO BE THROWN INTO THE HELL OF FIRE

SEE THAT YOU DO NOT DESPISE ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES

FOR I TELL YOU THAT IN HEAVEN THEIR ANGELS ALWAYS SEE THE FACE OF MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

SEE FOOTNOTE WHAT DO YOU THINK

IF A MAN HAS A HUNDRED SHEEP AND ONE OF THEM HAS GONE ASTRAY DOES HE NOT LEAVE THE NINETYNINE ON THE MOUNTAINS AND GO IN SEARCH OF THE ONE THAT WENT ASTRAY

AND IF HE FINDS IT TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE REJOICES OVER IT MORE THAN OVER THE NINETYNINE THAT NEVER WENT ASTRAY

SO IT IS NOT THE WILL OF MY FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN THAT ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES SHOULD PERISH

IF YOUR BROTHER SINS AGAINST YOU GO AND TELL HIM HIS FAULT BETWEEN YOU AND HIM ALONE

IF HE LISTENS TO YOU YOU HAVE GAINED YOUR BROTHER

BUT IF HE DOES NOT LISTEN TAKE ONE OR TWO OTHERS ALONG WITH YOU THAT EVERY CHARGE MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES

IF HE REFUSES TO LISTEN TO THEM TELL IT TO THE CHURCH

AND IF HE REFUSES TO LISTEN EVEN TO THE CHURCH LET HIM BE TO YOU AS A GENTILE AND A TAX COLLECTOR

TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH SHALL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN AND WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH SHALL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN

AGAIN I SAY TO YOU IF TWO OF YOU AGREE ON EARTH ABOUT ANYTHING THEY ASK IT WILL BE DONE FOR THEM BY MY FATHER IN HEAVEN

FOR WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED IN MY NAME THERE AM I AMONG THEM

 THEN PETER CAME UP AND SAID TO HIM LORD HOW OFTEN WILL MY BROTHER SIN AGAINST ME AND I FORGIVE HIM

AS MANY AS SEVEN TIMES

 JESUS SAID TO HIM I DO NOT SAY TO YOU SEVEN TIMES BUT SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN

THEREFORE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MAY BE COMPARED TO A KING WHO WISHED TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH HIS SERVANTS

WHEN HE BEGAN TO SETTLE ONE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM WHO OWED HIM TEN THOUSAND TALENTS

AND SINCE HE COULD NOT PAY HIS MASTER ORDERED HIM TO BE SOLD WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND ALL THAT HE HAD AND PAYMENT TO BE MADE

SO THE SERVANT FELL ON HIS KNEES IMPLORING HIM 'HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME AND I WILL PAY YOU EVERYTHING

' AND OUT OF PITY FOR HIM THE MASTER OF THAT SERVANT RELEASED HIM AND FORGAVE HIM THE DEBT

BUT WHEN THAT SAME SERVANT WENT OUT HE FOUND ONE OF HIS FELLOW SERVANTS WHO OWED HIM A HUNDRED DENARII AND SEIZING HIM HE BEGAN TO CHOKE HIM SAYING 'PAY WHAT YOU OWE

' SO HIS FELLOW SERVANT FELL DOWN AND PLEADED WITH HIM 'HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME AND I WILL PAY YOU

' HE REFUSED AND WENT AND PUT HIM IN PRISON UNTIL HE SHOULD PAY THE DEBT

WHEN HIS FELLOW SERVANTS SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THEY WERE GREATLY DISTRESSED AND THEY WENT AND REPORTED TO THEIR MASTER ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE

THEN HIS MASTER SUMMONED HIM AND SAID TO HIM 'YOU WICKED SERVANT

I FORGAVE YOU ALL THAT DEBT BECAUSE YOU PLEADED WITH ME

AND SHOULD NOT YOU HAVE HAD MERCY ON YOUR FELLOW SERVANT AS I HAD MERCY ON YOU

' AND IN ANGER HIS MASTER DELIVERED HIM TO THE JAILERS UNTIL HE SHOULD PAY ALL HIS DEBT

SO ALSO MY HEAVENLY FATHER WILL DO TO EVERY ONE OF YOU IF YOU DO NOT FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER FROM YOUR HEART

NOW WHEN JESUS HAD FINISHED THESE SAYINGS HE WENT AWAY FROM GALILEE AND ENTERED THE REGION OF JUDEA BEYOND THE JORDAN

AND LARGE CROWDS FOLLOWED HIM AND HE HEALED THEM THERE

AND PHARISEES CAME UP TO HIM AND TESTED HIM BY ASKING IS IT LAWFUL TO DIVORCE ONE'S WIFE FOR ANY CAUSE

 HE ANSWERED HAVE YOU NOT READ THAT HE WHO CREATED THEM FROM THE BEGINNING MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE AND SAID 'THEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND HOLD FAST TO HIS WIFE AND THEY SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'

SO THEY ARE NO LONGER TWO BUT ONE FLESH

WHAT THEREFORE GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER LET NOT MAN SEPARATE

 THEY SAID TO HIM WHY THEN DID MOSES COMMAND ONE TO GIVE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND TO SEND HER AWAY

 HE SAID TO THEM BECAUSE OF YOUR HARDNESS OF HEART MOSES ALLOWED YOU TO DIVORCE YOUR WIVES BUT FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS NOT SO

AND I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER DIVORCES HIS WIFE EXCEPT FOR SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND MARRIES ANOTHER COMMITS ADULTERY

 THE DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM IF SUCH IS THE CASE OF A MAN WITH HIS WIFE IT IS BETTER NOT TO MARRY

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM NOT EVERYONE CAN RECEIVE THIS SAYING BUT ONLY THOSE TO WHOM IT IS GIVEN

FOR THERE ARE EUNUCHS WHO HAVE BEEN SO FROM BIRTH AND THERE ARE EUNUCHS WHO HAVE BEEN MADE EUNUCHS BY MEN AND THERE ARE EUNUCHS WHO HAVE MADE THEMSELVES EUNUCHS FOR THE SAKE OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

LET THE ONE WHO IS ABLE TO RECEIVE THIS RECEIVE IT

 THEN CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT LAY HIS HANDS ON THEM AND PRAY

THE DISCIPLES REBUKED THE PEOPLE BUT JESUS SAID LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME TO ME AND DO NOT HINDER THEM FOR TO SUCH BELONGS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

 AND HE LAID HIS HANDS ON THEM AND WENT AWAY

AND BEHOLD A MAN CAME UP TO HIM SAYING TEACHER WHAT GOOD DEED MUST I DO TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE

 AND HE SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU ASK ME ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD

THERE IS ONLY ONE WHO IS GOOD

IF YOU WOULD ENTER LIFE KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS

 HE SAID TO HIM WHICH ONES

 AND JESUS SAID YOU SHALL NOT MURDER YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY YOU SHALL NOT STEAL YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER AND YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

 THE YOUNG MAN SAID TO HIM ALL THESE I HAVE KEPT

WHAT DO I STILL LACK

 JESUS SAID TO HIM IF YOU WOULD BE PERFECT GO SELL WHAT YOU POSSESS AND GIVE TO THE POOR AND YOU WILL HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN; AND COME FOLLOW ME

 WHEN THE YOUNG MAN HEARD THIS HE WENT AWAY SORROWFUL FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS

AND JESUS SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES TRULY I SAY TO YOU ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY WILL A RICH PERSON ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

AGAIN I TELL YOU IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO GO THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN FOR A RICH PERSON TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 WHEN THE DISCIPLES HEARD THIS THEY WERE GREATLY ASTONISHED SAYING WHO THEN CAN BE SAVED

 BUT JESUS LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WITH MAN THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE

 THEN PETER SAID IN REPLY SEE WE HAVE LEFT EVERYTHING AND FOLLOWED YOU

WHAT THEN WILL WE HAVE

 JESUS SAID TO THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU IN THE NEW WORLD WHEN THE SON OF MAN WILL SIT ON HIS GLORIOUS THRONE YOU WHO HAVE FOLLOWED ME WILL ALSO SIT ON TWELVE THRONES JUDGING THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

AND EVERYONE WHO HAS LEFT HOUSES OR BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR FATHER OR MOTHER OR CHILDREN OR LANDS FOR MY NAME'S SAKE WILL RECEIVE A HUNDREDFOLD AND WILL INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE

BUT MANY WHO ARE FIRST WILL BE LAST AND THE LAST FIRST

FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE A MASTER OF A HOUSE WHO WENT OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING TO HIRE LABORERS FOR HIS VINEYARD

AFTER AGREEING WITH THE LABORERS FOR A DENARIUS A DAY HE SENT THEM INTO HIS VINEYARD

AND GOING OUT ABOUT THE THIRD HOUR HE SAW OTHERS STANDING IDLE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND TO THEM HE SAID 'YOU GO INTO THE VINEYARD TOO AND WHATEVER IS RIGHT I WILL GIVE YOU

' SO THEY WENT

GOING OUT AGAIN ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR AND THE NINTH HOUR HE DID THE SAME

AND ABOUT THE ELEVENTH HOUR HE WENT OUT AND FOUND OTHERS STANDING

AND HE SAID TO THEM 'WHY DO YOU STAND HERE IDLE ALL DAY

' THEY SAID TO HIM 'BECAUSE NO ONE HAS HIRED US

' HE SAID TO THEM 'YOU GO INTO THE VINEYARD TOO

' AND WHEN EVENING CAME THE OWNER OF THE VINEYARD SAID TO HIS FOREMAN 'CALL THE LABORERS AND PAY THEM THEIR WAGES BEGINNING WITH THE LAST UP TO THE FIRST

' AND WHEN THOSE HIRED ABOUT THE ELEVENTH HOUR CAME EACH OF THEM RECEIVED A DENARIUS

NOW WHEN THOSE HIRED FIRST CAME THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD RECEIVE MORE BUT EACH OF THEM ALSO RECEIVED A DENARIUS

AND ON RECEIVING IT THEY GRUMBLED AT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAYING 'THESE LAST WORKED ONLY ONE HOUR AND YOU HAVE MADE THEM EQUAL TO US WHO HAVE BORNE THE BURDEN OF THE DAY AND THE SCORCHING HEAT

' BUT HE REPLIED TO ONE OF THEM 'FRIEND I AM DOING YOU NO WRONG

DID YOU NOT AGREE WITH ME FOR A DENARIUS

TAKE WHAT BELONGS TO YOU AND GO

I CHOOSE TO GIVE TO THIS LAST WORKER AS I GIVE TO YOU

AM I NOT ALLOWED TO DO WHAT I CHOOSE WITH WHAT BELONGS TO ME

OR DO YOU BEGRUDGE MY GENEROSITY

' SO THE LAST WILL BE FIRST AND THE FIRST LAST

 AND AS JESUS WAS GOING UP TO JERUSALEM HE TOOK THE TWELVE DISCIPLES ASIDE AND ON THE WAY HE SAID TO THEM SEE WE ARE GOING UP TO JERUSALEM

AND THE SON OF MAN WILL BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND SCRIBES AND THEY WILL CONDEMN HIM TO DEATH AND DELIVER HIM OVER TO THE GENTILES TO BE MOCKED AND FLOGGED AND CRUCIFIED AND HE WILL BE RAISED ON THE THIRD DAY

 THEN THE MOTHER OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE CAME UP TO HIM WITH HER SONS AND KNEELING BEFORE HIM SHE ASKED HIM FOR SOMETHING

AND HE SAID TO HER WHAT DO YOU WANT

 SHE SAID TO HIM SAY THAT THESE TWO SONS OF MINE ARE TO SIT ONE AT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ONE AT YOUR LEFT IN YOUR KINGDOM

 JESUS ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING

ARE YOU ABLE TO DRINK THE CUP THAT I AM TO DRINK

 THEY SAID TO HIM WE ARE ABLE

 HE SAID TO THEM YOU WILL DRINK MY CUP BUT TO SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND AND AT MY LEFT IS NOT MINE TO GRANT BUT IT IS FOR THOSE FOR WHOM IT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY MY FATHER

 AND WHEN THE TEN HEARD IT THEY WERE INDIGNANT AT THE TWO BROTHERS

BUT JESUS CALLED THEM TO HIM AND SAID YOU KNOW THAT THE RULERS OF THE GENTILES LORD IT OVER THEM AND THEIR GREAT ONES EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER THEM

IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU

BUT WHOEVER WOULD BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT AND WHOEVER WOULD BE FIRST AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SLAVE EVEN AS THE SON OF MAN CAME NOT TO BE SERVED BUT TO SERVE AND TO GIVE HIS LIFE AS A RANSOM FOR MANY

 AND AS THEY WENT OUT OF JERICHO A GREAT CROWD FOLLOWED HIM

AND BEHOLD THERE WERE TWO BLIND MEN SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT JESUS WAS PASSING BY THEY CRIED OUT LORD HAVE MERCY ON US SON OF DAVID

 THE CROWD REBUKED THEM TELLING THEM TO BE SILENT BUT THEY CRIED OUT ALL THE MORE LORD HAVE MERCY ON US SON OF DAVID

 AND STOPPING JESUS CALLED THEM AND SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU

 THEY SAID TO HIM LORD LET OUR EYES BE OPENED

 AND JESUS IN PITY TOUCHED THEIR EYES AND IMMEDIATELY THEY RECOVERED THEIR SIGHT AND FOLLOWED HIM

NOW WHEN THEY DREW NEAR TO JERUSALEM AND CAME TO BETHPHAGE TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES THEN JESUS SENT TWO DISCIPLES SAYING TO THEM GO INTO THE VILLAGE IN FRONT OF YOU AND IMMEDIATELY YOU WILL FIND A DONKEY TIED AND A COLT WITH HER

UNTIE THEM AND BRING THEM TO ME

IF ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING TO YOU YOU SHALL SAY 'THE LORD NEEDS THEM' AND HE WILL SEND THEM AT ONCE

 THIS TOOK PLACE TO FULFILL WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET SAYING SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU HUMBLE AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY AND ON A COLT THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN

' THE DISCIPLES WENT AND DID AS JESUS HAD DIRECTED THEM

THEY BROUGHT THE DONKEY AND THE COLT AND PUT ON THEM THEIR CLOAKS AND HE SAT ON THEM

MOST OF THE CROWD SPREAD THEIR CLOAKS ON THE ROAD AND OTHERS CUT BRANCHES FROM THE TREES AND SPREAD THEM ON THE ROAD

AND THE CROWDS THAT WENT BEFORE HIM AND THAT FOLLOWED HIM WERE SHOUTING HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID

BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST

 AND WHEN HE ENTERED JERUSALEM THE WHOLE CITY WAS STIRRED UP SAYING WHO IS THIS

 AND THE CROWDS SAID THIS IS THE PROPHET JESUS FROM NAZARETH OF GALILEE

 AND JESUS ENTERED THE TEMPLE AND DROVE OUT ALL WHO SOLD AND BOUGHT IN THE TEMPLE AND HE OVERTURNED THE TABLES OF THE MONEYCHANGERS AND THE SEATS OF THOSE WHO SOLD PIGEONS

HE SAID TO THEM IT IS WRITTEN 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER' BUT YOU MAKE IT A DEN OF ROBBERS

 AND THE BLIND AND THE LAME CAME TO HIM IN THE TEMPLE AND HE HEALED THEM

BUT WHEN THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES SAW THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HE DID AND THE CHILDREN CRYING OUT IN THE TEMPLE HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID

 THEY WERE INDIGNANT AND THEY SAID TO HIM DO YOU HEAR WHAT THESE ARE SAYING

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM YES; HAVE YOU NEVER READ 'OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE'

 AND LEAVING THEM HE WENT OUT OF THE CITY TO BETHANY AND LODGED THERE

IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS RETURNING TO THE CITY HE BECAME HUNGRY

AND SEEING A FIG TREE BY THE WAYSIDE HE WENT TO IT AND FOUND NOTHING ON IT BUT ONLY LEAVES

AND HE SAID TO IT MAY NO FRUIT EVER COME FROM YOU AGAIN

 AND THE FIG TREE WITHERED AT ONCE

WHEN THE DISCIPLES SAW IT THEY MARVELED SAYING HOW DID THE FIG TREE WITHER AT ONCE

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU IF YOU HAVE FAITH AND DO NOT DOUBT YOU WILL NOT ONLY DO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO THE FIG TREE BUT EVEN IF YOU SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN 'BE TAKEN UP AND THROWN INTO THE SEA' IT WILL HAPPEN

AND WHATEVER YOU ASK IN PRAYER YOU WILL RECEIVE IF YOU HAVE FAITH

 AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE TEMPLE THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE CAME UP TO HIM AS HE WAS TEACHING AND SAID BY WHAT AUTHORITY ARE YOU DOING THESE THINGS AND WHO GAVE YOU THIS AUTHORITY

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM I ALSO WILL ASK YOU ONE QUESTION AND IF YOU TELL ME THE ANSWER THEN I ALSO WILL TELL YOU BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DO THESE THINGS

THE BAPTISM OF JOHN FROM WHERE DID IT COME

FROM HEAVEN OR FROM MAN

 AND THEY DISCUSSED IT AMONG THEMSELVES SAYING IF WE SAY 'FROM HEAVEN' HE WILL SAY TO US 'WHY THEN DID YOU NOT BELIEVE HIM

' BUT IF WE SAY 'FROM MAN' WE ARE AFRAID OF THE CROWD FOR THEY ALL HOLD THAT JOHN WAS A PROPHET

 SO THEY ANSWERED JESUS WE DO NOT KNOW

 AND HE SAID TO THEM NEITHER WILL I TELL YOU BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DO THESE THINGS

WHAT DO YOU THINK

A MAN HAD TWO SONS

AND HE WENT TO THE FIRST AND SAID 'SON GO AND WORK IN THE VINEYARD TODAY

' AND HE ANSWERED 'I WILL NOT' BUT AFTERWARD HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND WENT

AND HE WENT TO THE OTHER SON AND SAID THE SAME

AND HE ANSWERED 'I GO SIR' BUT DID NOT GO

WHICH OF THE TWO DID THE WILL OF HIS FATHER

 THEY SAID THE FIRST

 JESUS SAID TO THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU THE TAX COLLECTORS AND THE PROSTITUTES GO INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD BEFORE YOU

FOR JOHN CAME TO YOU IN THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND YOU DID NOT BELIEVE HIM BUT THE TAX COLLECTORS AND THE PROSTITUTES BELIEVED HIM

AND EVEN WHEN YOU SAW IT YOU DID NOT AFTERWARD CHANGE YOUR MINDS AND BELIEVE HIM

HEAR ANOTHER PARABLE

THERE WAS A MASTER OF A HOUSE WHO PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A FENCE AROUND IT AND DUG A WINEPRESS IN IT AND BUILT A TOWER AND LEASED IT TO TENANTS AND WENT INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY

WHEN THE SEASON FOR FRUIT DREW NEAR HE SENT HIS SERVANTS TO THE TENANTS TO GET HIS FRUIT

AND THE TENANTS TOOK HIS SERVANTS AND BEAT ONE KILLED ANOTHER AND STONED ANOTHER

AGAIN HE SENT OTHER SERVANTS MORE THAN THE FIRST

AND THEY DID THE SAME TO THEM

FINALLY HE SENT HIS SON TO THEM SAYING 'THEY WILL RESPECT MY SON

' BUT WHEN THE TENANTS SAW THE SON THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES 'THIS IS THE HEIR

COME LET US KILL HIM AND HAVE HIS INHERITANCE

' AND THEY TOOK HIM AND THREW HIM OUT OF THE VINEYARD AND KILLED HIM

WHEN THEREFORE THE OWNER OF THE VINEYARD COMES WHAT WILL HE DO TO THOSE TENANTS

 THEY SAID TO HIM HE WILL PUT THOSE WRETCHES TO A MISERABLE DEATH AND LET OUT THE VINEYARD TO OTHER TENANTS WHO WILL GIVE HIM THE FRUITS IN THEIR SEASONS

 JESUS SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU NEVER READ IN THE SCRIPTURES 'THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE; THIS WAS THE LORD'S DOING AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'

THEREFORE I TELL YOU THE KINGDOM OF GOD WILL BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU AND GIVEN TO A PEOPLE PRODUCING ITS FRUITS

AND THE ONE WHO FALLS ON THIS STONE WILL BE BROKEN TO PIECES; AND WHEN IT FALLS ON ANYONE IT WILL CRUSH HIM

 WHEN THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PHARISEES HEARD HIS PARABLES THEY PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THEM

AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEEKING TO ARREST HIM THEY FEARED THE CROWDS BECAUSE THEY HELD HIM TO BE A PROPHET

AND AGAIN JESUS SPOKE TO THEM IN PARABLES SAYING THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MAY BE COMPARED TO A KING WHO GAVE A WEDDING FEAST FOR HIS SON AND SENT HIS SERVANTS TO CALL THOSE WHO WERE INVITED TO THE WEDDING FEAST BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME

AGAIN HE SENT OTHER SERVANTS SAYING 'TELL THOSE WHO ARE INVITED SEE I HAVE PREPARED MY DINNER MY OXEN AND MY FAT CALVES HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED AND EVERYTHING IS READY

COME TO THE WEDDING FEAST

' BUT THEY PAID NO ATTENTION AND WENT OFF ONE TO HIS FARM ANOTHER TO HIS BUSINESS WHILE THE REST SEIZED HIS SERVANTS TREATED THEM SHAMEFULLY AND KILLED THEM

THE KING WAS ANGRY AND HE SENT HIS TROOPS AND DESTROYED THOSE MURDERERS AND BURNED THEIR CITY

THEN HE SAID TO HIS SERVANTS 'THE WEDDING FEAST IS READY BUT THOSE INVITED WERE NOT WORTHY

GO THEREFORE TO THE MAIN ROADS AND INVITE TO THE WEDDING FEAST AS MANY AS YOU FIND

' AND THOSE SERVANTS WENT OUT INTO THE ROADS AND GATHERED ALL WHOM THEY FOUND BOTH BAD AND GOOD

SO THE WEDDING HALL WAS FILLED WITH GUESTS

BUT WHEN THE KING CAME IN TO LOOK AT THE GUESTS HE SAW THERE A MAN WHO HAD NO WEDDING GARMENT

AND HE SAID TO HIM 'FRIEND HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE WITHOUT A WEDDING GARMENT

' AND HE WAS SPEECHLESS

THEN THE KING SAID TO THE ATTENDANTS 'BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND CAST HIM INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

' FOR MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN

 THEN THE PHARISEES WENT AND PLOTTED HOW TO ENTANGLE HIM IN HIS TALK

AND THEY SENT THEIR DISCIPLES TO HIM ALONG WITH THE HERODIANS SAYING TEACHER WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE TRUE AND TEACH THE WAY OF GOD TRUTHFULLY AND YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE'S OPINION FOR YOU ARE NOT SWAYED BY APPEARANCES

TELL US THEN WHAT YOU THINK

IS IT LAWFUL TO PAY TAXES TO CAESAR OR NOT

 BUT JESUS AWARE OF THEIR MALICE SAID WHY PUT ME TO THE TEST YOU HYPOCRITES

SHOW ME THE COIN FOR THE TAX

 AND THEY BROUGHT HIM A DENARIUS

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM WHOSE LIKENESS AND INSCRIPTION IS THIS

 THEY SAID CAESAR'S

 THEN HE SAID TO THEM THEREFORE RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD'S

 WHEN THEY HEARD IT THEY MARVELED

AND THEY LEFT HIM AND WENT AWAY

THE SAME DAY SADDUCEES CAME TO HIM WHO SAY THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION AND THEY ASKED HIM A QUESTION SAYING TEACHER MOSES SAID 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN HIS BROTHER MUST MARRY THE WIDOW AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER

' NOW THERE WERE SEVEN BROTHERS AMONG US

THE FIRST MARRIED AND DIED AND HAVING NO CHILDREN LEFT HIS WIFE TO HIS BROTHER

SO TOO THE SECOND AND THIRD DOWN TO THE SEVENTH

AFTER THEM ALL THE WOMAN DIED

IN THE RESURRECTION THEREFORE OF THE SEVEN WHOSE WIFE WILL SHE BE

FOR THEY ALL HAD HER

 BUT JESUS ANSWERED THEM YOU ARE WRONG BECAUSE YOU KNOW NEITHER THE SCRIPTURES NOR THE POWER OF GOD

FOR IN THE RESURRECTION THEY NEITHER MARRY NOR ARE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE BUT ARE LIKE ANGELS IN HEAVEN

AND AS FOR THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD HAVE YOU NOT READ WHAT WAS SAID TO YOU BY GOD 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB'

HE IS NOT GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING

 AND WHEN THE CROWD HEARD IT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING

BUT WHEN THE PHARISEES HEARD THAT HE HAD SILENCED THE SADDUCEES THEY GATHERED TOGETHER

AND ONE OF THEM A LAWYER ASKED HIM A QUESTION TO TEST HIM

TEACHER WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW

 AND HE SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND

THIS IS THE GREAT AND FIRST COMMANDMENT

AND A SECOND IS LIKE IT YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

ON THESE TWO COMMANDMENTS DEPEND ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS

 NOW WHILE THE PHARISEES WERE GATHERED TOGETHER JESUS ASKED THEM A QUESTION SAYING WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHRIST

WHOSE SON IS HE

 THEY SAID TO HIM THE SON OF DAVID

 HE SAID TO THEM HOW IS IT THEN THAT DAVID IN THE SPIRIT CALLS HIM LORD SAYING 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES UNDER YOUR FEET'

IF THEN DAVID CALLS HIM LORD HOW IS HE HIS SON

 AND NO ONE WAS ABLE TO ANSWER HIM A WORD NOR FROM THAT DAY DID ANYONE DARE TO ASK HIM ANY MORE QUESTIONS

THEN JESUS SAID TO THE CROWDS AND TO HIS DISCIPLES THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES SIT ON MOSES' SEAT SO PRACTICE AND OBSERVE WHATEVER THEY TELL YOUBUT NOT WHAT THEY DO

FOR THEY PREACH BUT DO NOT PRACTICE

THEY TIE UP HEAVY BURDENS HARD TO BEAR AND LAY THEM ON PEOPLE'S SHOULDERS BUT THEY THEMSELVES ARE NOT WILLING TO MOVE THEM WITH THEIR FINGER

THEY DO ALL THEIR DEEDS TO BE SEEN BY OTHERS

FOR THEY MAKE THEIR PHYLACTERIES BROAD AND THEIR FRINGES LONG AND THEY LOVE THE PLACE OF HONOR AT FEASTS AND THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND GREETINGS IN THE MARKETPLACES AND BEING CALLED RABBI BY OTHERS

BUT YOU ARE NOT TO BE CALLED RABBI FOR YOU HAVE ONE TEACHER AND YOU ARE ALL BROTHERS

AND CALL NO MAN YOUR FATHER ON EARTH FOR YOU HAVE ONE FATHER WHO IS IN HEAVEN

NEITHER BE CALLED INSTRUCTORS FOR YOU HAVE ONE INSTRUCTOR THE CHRIST

THE GREATEST AMONG YOU SHALL BE YOUR SERVANT

WHOEVER EXALTS HIMSELF WILL BE HUMBLED AND WHOEVER HUMBLES HIMSELF WILL BE EXALTED

BUT WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU SHUT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IN PEOPLE'S FACES

FOR YOU NEITHER ENTER YOURSELVES NOR ALLOW THOSE WHO WOULD ENTER TO GO IN

SEE FOOTNOTE WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU TRAVEL ACROSS SEA AND LAND TO MAKE A SINGLE PROSELYTE AND WHEN HE BECOMES A PROSELYTE YOU MAKE HIM TWICE AS MUCH A CHILD OF HELL AS YOURSELVES

WOE TO YOU BLIND GUIDES WHO SAY 'IF ANYONE SWEARS BY THE TEMPLE IT IS NOTHING BUT IF ANYONE SWEARS BY THE GOLD OF THE TEMPLE HE IS BOUND BY HIS OATH

' YOU BLIND FOOLS

FOR WHICH IS GREATER THE GOLD OR THE TEMPLE THAT HAS MADE THE GOLD SACRED

AND YOU SAY 'IF ANYONE SWEARS BY THE ALTAR IT IS NOTHING BUT IF ANYONE SWEARS BY THE GIFT THAT IS ON THE ALTAR HE IS BOUND BY HIS OATH

' YOU BLIND MEN

FOR WHICH IS GREATER THE GIFT OR THE ALTAR THAT MAKES THE GIFT SACRED

SO WHOEVER SWEARS BY THE ALTAR SWEARS BY IT AND BY EVERYTHING ON IT

AND WHOEVER SWEARS BY THE TEMPLE SWEARS BY IT AND BY HIM WHO DWELLS IN IT

AND WHOEVER SWEARS BY HEAVEN SWEARS BY THE THRONE OF GOD AND BY HIM WHO SITS UPON IT

WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU TITHE MINT AND DILL AND CUMIN AND HAVE NEGLECTED THE WEIGHTIER MATTERS OF THE LAW JUSTICE AND MERCY AND FAITHFULNESS

THESE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITHOUT NEGLECTING THE OTHERS

YOU BLIND GUIDES STRAINING OUT A GNAT AND SWALLOWING A CAMEL

WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU CLEAN THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND THE PLATE BUT INSIDE THEY ARE FULL OF GREED AND SELFINDULGENCE

YOU BLIND PHARISEE

FIRST CLEAN THE INSIDE OF THE CUP AND THE PLATE THAT THE OUTSIDE ALSO MAY BE CLEAN

WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU ARE LIKE WHITEWASHED TOMBS WHICH OUTWARDLY APPEAR BEAUTIFUL BUT WITHIN ARE FULL OF DEAD PEOPLE'S BONES AND ALL UNCLEANNESS

SO YOU ALSO OUTWARDLY APPEAR RIGHTEOUS TO OTHERS BUT WITHIN YOU ARE FULL OF HYPOCRISY AND LAWLESSNESS

WOE TO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES HYPOCRITES

FOR YOU BUILD THE TOMBS OF THE PROPHETS AND DECORATE THE MONUMENTS OF THE RIGHTEOUS SAYING 'IF WE HAD LIVED IN THE DAYS OF OUR FATHERS WE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PART WITH THEM IN SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF THE PROPHETS

' THUS YOU WITNESS AGAINST YOURSELVES THAT YOU ARE SONS OF THOSE WHO MURDERED THE PROPHETS

FILL UP THEN THE MEASURE OF YOUR FATHERS

YOU SERPENTS YOU BROOD OF VIPERS HOW ARE YOU TO ESCAPE BEING SENTENCED TO HELL

THEREFORE I SEND YOU PROPHETS AND WISE MEN AND SCRIBES SOME OF WHOM YOU WILL KILL AND CRUCIFY AND SOME YOU WILL FLOG IN YOUR SYNAGOGUES AND PERSECUTE FROM TOWN TO TOWN SO THAT ON YOU MAY COME ALL THE RIGHTEOUS BLOOD SHED ON EARTH FROM THE BLOOD OF INNOCENT ABEL TO THE BLOOD OF ZECHARIAH THE SON OF BARACHIAH WHOM YOU MURDERED BETWEEN THE SANCTUARY AND THE ALTAR

TRULY I SAY TO YOU ALL THESE THINGS WILL COME UPON THIS GENERATION

O JERUSALEM JERUSALEM THE CITY THAT KILLS THE PROPHETS AND STONES THOSE WHO ARE SENT TO IT

HOW OFTEN WOULD I HAVE GATHERED YOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER AS A HEN GATHERS HER BROOD UNDER HER WINGS AND YOU WOULD NOT

SEE YOUR HOUSE IS LEFT TO YOU DESOLATE

FOR I TELL YOU YOU WILL NOT SEE ME AGAIN UNTIL YOU SAY 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

'JESUS LEFT THE TEMPLE AND WAS GOING AWAY WHEN HIS DISCIPLES CAME TO POINT OUT TO HIM THE BUILDINGS OF THE TEMPLE

BUT HE ANSWERED THEM YOU SEE ALL THESE DO YOU NOT

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THERE WILL NOT BE LEFT HERE ONE STONE UPON ANOTHER THAT WILL NOT BE THROWN DOWN

 AS HE SAT ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES THE DISCIPLES CAME TO HIM PRIVATELY SAYING TELL US WHEN WILL THESE THINGS BE AND WHAT WILL BE THE SIGN OF YOUR COMING AND OF THE CLOSE OF THE AGE

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM SEE THAT NO ONE LEADS YOU ASTRAY

FOR MANY WILL COME IN MY NAME SAYING 'I AM THE CHRIST' AND THEY WILL LEAD MANY ASTRAY

AND YOU WILL HEAR OF WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS

SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT ALARMED FOR THIS MUST TAKE PLACE BUT THE END IS NOT YET

FOR NATION WILL RISE AGAINST NATION AND KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM AND THERE WILL BE FAMINES AND EARTHQUAKES IN VARIOUS PLACES

ALL THESE ARE BUT THE BEGINNING OF THE BIRTH PAINS

THEN THEY WILL DELIVER YOU UP TO TRIBULATION AND PUT YOU TO DEATH AND YOU WILL BE HATED BY ALL NATIONS FOR MY NAME'S SAKE

AND THEN MANY WILL FALL AWAY AND BETRAY ONE ANOTHER AND HATE ONE ANOTHER

AND MANY FALSE PROPHETS WILL ARISE AND LEAD MANY ASTRAY

AND BECAUSE LAWLESSNESS WILL BE INCREASED THE LOVE OF MANY WILL GROW COLD

BUT THE ONE WHO ENDURES TO THE END WILL BE SAVED

AND THIS GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM WILL BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD AS A TESTIMONY TO ALL NATIONS AND THEN THE END WILL COME

SO WHEN YOU SEE THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHET DANIEL STANDING IN THE HOLY PLACE LET THE READER UNDERSTAND THEN LET THOSE WHO ARE IN JUDEA FLEE TO THE MOUNTAINS

LET THE ONE WHO IS ON THE HOUSETOP NOT GO DOWN TO TAKE WHAT IS IN HIS HOUSE AND LET THE ONE WHO IS IN THE FIELD NOT TURN BACK TO TAKE HIS CLOAK

AND ALAS FOR WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NURSING INFANTS IN THOSE DAYS

PRAY THAT YOUR FLIGHT MAY NOT BE IN WINTER OR ON A SABBATH

FOR THEN THERE WILL BE GREAT TRIBULATION SUCH AS HAS NOT BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD UNTIL NOW NO AND NEVER WILL BE

AND IF THOSE DAYS HAD NOT BEEN CUT SHORT NO HUMAN BEING WOULD BE SAVED

BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ELECT THOSE DAYS WILL BE CUT SHORT

THEN IF ANYONE SAYS TO YOU 'LOOK HERE IS THE CHRIST

' OR 'THERE HE IS

' DO NOT BELIEVE IT

FOR FALSE CHRISTS AND FALSE PROPHETS WILL ARISE AND PERFORM GREAT SIGNS AND WONDERS SO AS TO LEAD ASTRAY IF POSSIBLE EVEN THE ELECT

SEE I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFOREHAND

SO IF THEY SAY TO YOU 'LOOK HE IS IN THE WILDERNESS' DO NOT GO OUT

IF THEY SAY 'LOOK HE IS IN THE INNER ROOMS' DO NOT BELIEVE IT

FOR AS THE LIGHTNING COMES FROM THE EAST AND SHINES AS FAR AS THE WEST SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN

WHEREVER THE CORPSE IS THERE THE VULTURES WILL GATHER

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIBULATION OF THOSE DAYS THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT AND THE STARS WILL FALL FROM HEAVEN AND THE POWERS OF THE HEAVENS WILL BE SHAKEN

THEN WILL APPEAR IN HEAVEN THE SIGN OF THE SON OF MAN AND THEN ALL THE TRIBES OF THE EARTH WILL MOURN AND THEY WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN WITH POWER AND GREAT GLORY

AND HE WILL SEND OUT HIS ANGELS WITH A LOUD TRUMPET CALL AND THEY WILL GATHER HIS ELECT FROM THE FOUR WINDS FROM ONE END OF HEAVEN TO THE OTHER

FROM THE FIG TREE LEARN ITS LESSON AS SOON AS ITS BRANCH BECOMES TENDER AND PUTS OUT ITS LEAVES YOU KNOW THAT SUMMER IS NEAR

SO ALSO WHEN YOU SEE ALL THESE THINGS YOU KNOW THAT HE IS NEAR AT THE VERY GATES

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THIS GENERATION WILL NOT PASS AWAY UNTIL ALL THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE

HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY BUT MY WORDS WILL NOT PASS AWAY

BUT CONCERNING THAT DAY AND HOUR NO ONE KNOWS NOT EVEN THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN NOR THE SON BUT THE FATHER ONLY

AS WERE THE DAYS OF NOAH SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN

FOR AS IN THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE FLOOD THEY WERE EATING AND DRINKING MARRYING AND GIVING IN MARRIAGE UNTIL THE DAY WHEN NOAH ENTERED THE ARK AND THEY WERE UNAWARE UNTIL THE FLOOD CAME AND SWEPT THEM ALL AWAY SO WILL BE THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN

THEN TWO MEN WILL BE IN THE FIELD; ONE WILL BE TAKEN AND ONE LEFT

TWO WOMEN WILL BE GRINDING AT THE MILL; ONE WILL BE TAKEN AND ONE LEFT

THEREFORE STAY AWAKE FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW ON WHAT DAY YOUR LORD IS COMING

BUT KNOW THIS THAT IF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAD KNOWN IN WHAT PART OF THE NIGHT THE THIEF WAS COMING HE WOULD HAVE STAYED AWAKE AND WOULD NOT HAVE LET HIS HOUSE BE BROKEN INTO

THEREFORE YOU ALSO MUST BE READY FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COMING AT AN HOUR YOU DO NOT EXPECT

WHO THEN IS THE FAITHFUL AND WISE SERVANT WHOM HIS MASTER HAS SET OVER HIS HOUSEHOLD TO GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME

BLESSED IS THAT SERVANT WHOM HIS MASTER WILL FIND SO DOING WHEN HE COMES

TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE WILL SET HIM OVER ALL HIS POSSESSIONS

BUT IF THAT WICKED SERVANT SAYS TO HIMSELF 'MY MASTER IS DELAYED' AND BEGINS TO BEAT HIS FELLOW SERVANTS AND EATS AND DRINKS WITH DRUNKARDS THE MASTER OF THAT SERVANT WILL COME ON A DAY WHEN HE DOES NOT EXPECT HIM AND AT AN HOUR HE DOES NOT KNOW AND WILL CUT HIM IN PIECES AND PUT HIM WITH THE HYPOCRITES

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

THEN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN WILL BE LIKE TEN VIRGINS WHO TOOK THEIR LAMPS AND WENT TO MEET THE BRIDEGROOM

FIVE OF THEM WERE FOOLISH AND FIVE WERE WISE

FOR WHEN THE FOOLISH TOOK THEIR LAMPS THEY TOOK NO OIL WITH THEM BUT THE WISE TOOK FLASKS OF OIL WITH THEIR LAMPS

AS THE BRIDEGROOM WAS DELAYED THEY ALL BECAME DROWSY AND SLEPT

BUT AT MIDNIGHT THERE WAS A CRY 'HERE IS THE BRIDEGROOM

COME OUT TO MEET HIM

' THEN ALL THOSE VIRGINS ROSE AND TRIMMED THEIR LAMPS

AND THE FOOLISH SAID TO THE WISE 'GIVE US SOME OF YOUR OIL FOR OUR LAMPS ARE GOING OUT

' BUT THE WISE ANSWERED SAYING 'SINCE THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOR US AND FOR YOU GO RATHER TO THE DEALERS AND BUY FOR YOURSELVES

' AND WHILE THEY WERE GOING TO BUY THE BRIDEGROOM CAME AND THOSE WHO WERE READY WENT IN WITH HIM TO THE MARRIAGE FEAST AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT

AFTERWARD THE OTHER VIRGINS CAME ALSO SAYING 'LORD LORD OPEN TO US

' BUT HE ANSWERED 'TRULY I SAY TO YOU I DO NOT KNOW YOU

' WATCH THEREFORE FOR YOU KNOW NEITHER THE DAY NOR THE HOUR

FOR IT WILL BE LIKE A MAN GOING ON A JOURNEY WHO CALLED HIS SERVANTS AND ENTRUSTED TO THEM HIS PROPERTY

TO ONE HE GAVE FIVE TALENTS TO ANOTHER TWO TO ANOTHER ONE TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY

THEN HE WENT AWAY

HE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE FIVE TALENTS WENT AT ONCE AND TRADED WITH THEM AND HE MADE FIVE TALENTS MORE

SO ALSO HE WHO HAD THE TWO TALENTS MADE TWO TALENTS MORE

BUT HE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE ONE TALENT WENT AND DUG IN THE GROUND AND HID HIS MASTER'S MONEY

NOW AFTER A LONG TIME THE MASTER OF THOSE SERVANTS CAME AND SETTLED ACCOUNTS WITH THEM

AND HE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE FIVE TALENTS CAME FORWARD BRINGING FIVE TALENTS MORE SAYING 'MASTER YOU DELIVERED TO ME FIVE TALENTS; HERE I HAVE MADE FIVE TALENTS MORE

' HIS MASTER SAID TO HIM 'WELL DONE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT

YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL OVER A LITTLE; I WILL SET YOU OVER MUCH

ENTER INTO THE JOY OF YOUR MASTER

' AND HE ALSO WHO HAD THE TWO TALENTS CAME FORWARD SAYING 'MASTER YOU DELIVERED TO ME TWO TALENTS; HERE I HAVE MADE TWO TALENTS MORE

' HIS MASTER SAID TO HIM 'WELL DONE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT

YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL OVER A LITTLE; I WILL SET YOU OVER MUCH

ENTER INTO THE JOY OF YOUR MASTER

' HE ALSO WHO HAD RECEIVED THE ONE TALENT CAME FORWARD SAYING 'MASTER I KNEW YOU TO BE A HARD MAN REAPING WHERE YOU DID NOT SOW AND GATHERING WHERE YOU SCATTERED NO SEED SO I WAS AFRAID AND I WENT AND HID YOUR TALENT IN THE GROUND

HERE YOU HAVE WHAT IS YOURS

' BUT HIS MASTER ANSWERED HIM 'YOU WICKED AND SLOTHFUL SERVANT

YOU KNEW THAT I REAP WHERE I HAVE NOT SOWED AND GATHER WHERE I SCATTERED NO SEED

THEN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE INVESTED MY MONEY WITH THE BANKERS AND AT MY COMING I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED WHAT WAS MY OWN WITH INTEREST

SO TAKE THE TALENT FROM HIM AND GIVE IT TO HIM WHO HAS THE TEN TALENTS

FOR TO EVERYONE WHO HAS WILL MORE BE GIVEN AND HE WILL HAVE AN ABUNDANCE

BUT FROM THE ONE WHO HAS NOT EVEN WHAT HE HAS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY

AND CAST THE WORTHLESS SERVANT INTO THE OUTER DARKNESS

IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH

' WHEN THE SON OF MAN COMES IN HIS GLORY AND ALL THE ANGELS WITH HIM THEN HE WILL SIT ON HIS GLORIOUS THRONE

BEFORE HIM WILL BE GATHERED ALL THE NATIONS AND HE WILL SEPARATE PEOPLE ONE FROM ANOTHER AS A SHEPHERD SEPARATES THE SHEEP FROM THE GOATS

AND HE WILL PLACE THE SHEEP ON HIS RIGHT BUT THE GOATS ON THE LEFT

THEN THE KING WILL SAY TO THOSE ON HIS RIGHT 'COME YOU WHO ARE BLESSED BY MY FATHER INHERIT THE KINGDOM PREPARED FOR YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD

FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU WELCOMED ME I WAS NAKED AND YOU CLOTHED ME I WAS SICK AND YOU VISITED ME I WAS IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO ME

' THEN THE RIGHTEOUS WILL ANSWER HIM SAYING 'LORD WHEN DID WE SEE YOU HUNGRY AND FEED YOU OR THIRSTY AND GIVE YOU DRINK

AND WHEN DID WE SEE YOU A STRANGER AND WELCOME YOU OR NAKED AND CLOTHE YOU

AND WHEN DID WE SEE YOU SICK OR IN PRISON AND VISIT YOU

' AND THE KING WILL ANSWER THEM 'TRULY I SAY TO YOU AS YOU DID IT TO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BROTHERS YOU DID IT TO ME

' THEN HE WILL SAY TO THOSE ON HIS LEFT 'DEPART FROM ME YOU CURSED INTO THE ETERNAL FIRE PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS

FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME NO FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME NO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU DID NOT WELCOME ME NAKED AND YOU DID NOT CLOTHE ME SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU DID NOT VISIT ME

' THEN THEY ALSO WILL ANSWER SAYING 'LORD WHEN DID WE SEE YOU HUNGRY OR THIRSTY OR A STRANGER OR NAKED OR SICK OR IN PRISON AND DID NOT MINISTER TO YOU

' THEN HE WILL ANSWER THEM SAYING 'TRULY I SAY TO YOU AS YOU DID NOT DO IT TO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE YOU DID NOT DO IT TO ME

' AND THESE WILL GO AWAY INTO ETERNAL PUNISHMENT BUT THE RIGHTEOUS INTO ETERNAL LIFE

WHEN JESUS HAD FINISHED ALL THESE SAYINGS HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES YOU KNOW THAT AFTER TWO DAYS THE PASSOVER IS COMING AND THE SON OF MAN WILL BE DELIVERED UP TO BE CRUCIFIED

 THEN THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE GATHERED IN THE PALACE OF THE HIGH PRIEST WHOSE NAME WAS CAIAPHAS AND PLOTTED TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ARREST JESUS BY STEALTH AND KILL HIM

BUT THEY SAID NOT DURING THE FEAST LEST THERE BE AN UPROAR AMONG THE PEOPLE

 NOW WHEN JESUS WAS AT BETHANY IN THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE LEPER A WOMAN CAME UP TO HIM WITH AN ALABASTER FLASK OF VERY EXPENSIVE OINTMENT AND SHE POURED IT ON HIS HEAD AS HE RECLINED AT TABLE

AND WHEN THE DISCIPLES SAW IT THEY WERE INDIGNANT SAYING WHY THIS WASTE

FOR THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR A LARGE SUM AND GIVEN TO THE POOR

 BUT JESUS AWARE OF THIS SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU TROUBLE THE WOMAN

FOR SHE HAS DONE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO ME

FOR YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE POOR WITH YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS HAVE ME

IN POURING THIS OINTMENT ON MY BODY SHE HAS DONE IT TO PREPARE ME FOR BURIAL

TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHEREVER THIS GOSPEL IS PROCLAIMED IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHAT SHE HAS DONE WILL ALSO BE TOLD IN MEMORY OF HER

 THEN ONE OF THE TWELVE WHOSE NAME WAS JUDAS ISCARIOT WENT TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME IF I DELIVER HIM OVER TO YOU

 AND THEY PAID HIM THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER

AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETRAY HIM

NOW ON THE FIRST DAY OF UNLEAVENED BREAD THE DISCIPLES CAME TO JESUS SAYING WHERE WILL YOU HAVE US PREPARE FOR YOU TO EAT THE PASSOVER

 HE SAID GO INTO THE CITY TO A CERTAIN MAN AND SAY TO HIM 'THE TEACHER SAYS MY TIME IS AT HAND

I WILL KEEP THE PASSOVER AT YOUR HOUSE WITH MY DISCIPLES

' AND THE DISCIPLES DID AS JESUS HAD DIRECTED THEM AND THEY PREPARED THE PASSOVER

WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE RECLINED AT TABLE WITH THE TWELVE

AND AS THEY WERE EATING HE SAID TRULY I SAY TO YOU ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME

 AND THEY WERE VERY SORROWFUL AND BEGAN TO SAY TO HIM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IS IT I LORD

 HE ANSWERED HE WHO HAS DIPPED HIS HAND IN THE DISH WITH ME WILL BETRAY ME

THE SON OF MAN GOES AS IT IS WRITTEN OF HIM BUT WOE TO THAT MAN BY WHOM THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THAT MAN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN BORN

 JUDAS WHO WOULD BETRAY HIM ANSWERED IS IT I RABBI

 HE SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE SAID SO

 NOW AS THEY WERE EATING JESUS TOOK BREAD AND AFTER BLESSING IT BROKE IT AND GAVE IT TO THE DISCIPLES AND SAID TAKE EAT; THIS IS MY BODY

 AND HE TOOK A CUP AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE GAVE IT TO THEM SAYING DRINK OF IT ALL OF YOU FOR THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH IS POURED OUT FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

I TELL YOU I WILL NOT DRINK AGAIN OF THIS FRUIT OF THE VINE UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN I DRINK IT NEW WITH YOU IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM

 AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG A HYMN THEY WENT OUT TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES

THEN JESUS SAID TO THEM YOU WILL ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF ME THIS NIGHT

FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'I WILL STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK WILL BE SCATTERED

' BUT AFTER I AM RAISED UP I WILL GO BEFORE YOU TO GALILEE

 PETER ANSWERED HIM THOUGH THEY ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF YOU I WILL NEVER FALL AWAY

 JESUS SAID TO HIM TRULY I TELL YOU THIS VERY NIGHT BEFORE THE ROOSTER CROWS YOU WILL DENY ME THREE TIMES

 PETER SAID TO HIM EVEN IF I MUST DIE WITH YOU I WILL NOT DENY YOU

 AND ALL THE DISCIPLES SAID THE SAME

THEN JESUS WENT WITH THEM TO A PLACE CALLED GETHSEMANE AND HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES SIT HERE WHILE I GO OVER THERE AND PRAY

 AND TAKING WITH HIM PETER AND THE TWO SONS OF ZEBEDEE HE BEGAN TO BE SORROWFUL AND TROUBLED

THEN HE SAID TO THEM MY SOUL IS VERY SORROWFUL EVEN TO DEATH; REMAIN HERE AND WATCH WITH ME

 AND GOING A LITTLE FARTHER HE FELL ON HIS FACE AND PRAYED SAYING MY FATHER IF IT BE POSSIBLE LET THIS CUP PASS FROM ME; NEVERTHELESS NOT AS I WILL BUT AS YOU WILL

 AND HE CAME TO THE DISCIPLES AND FOUND THEM SLEEPING

AND HE SAID TO PETER SO COULD YOU NOT WATCH WITH ME ONE HOUR

WATCH AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY NOT ENTER INTO TEMPTATION

THE SPIRIT INDEED IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK

 AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME HE WENT AWAY AND PRAYED MY FATHER IF THIS CANNOT PASS UNLESS I DRINK IT YOUR WILL BE DONE

 AND AGAIN HE CAME AND FOUND THEM SLEEPING FOR THEIR EYES WERE HEAVY

SO LEAVING THEM AGAIN HE WENT AWAY AND PRAYED FOR THE THIRD TIME SAYING THE SAME WORDS AGAIN

THEN HE CAME TO THE DISCIPLES AND SAID TO THEM SLEEP AND TAKE YOUR REST LATER ON

SEE THE HOUR IS AT HAND AND THE SON OF MAN IS BETRAYED INTO THE HANDS OF SINNERS

RISE LET US BE GOING; SEE MY BETRAYER IS AT HAND

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING JUDAS CAME ONE OF THE TWELVE AND WITH HIM A GREAT CROWD WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE

NOW THE BETRAYER HAD GIVEN THEM A SIGN SAYING THE ONE I WILL KISS IS THE MAN; SEIZE HIM

 AND HE CAME UP TO JESUS AT ONCE AND SAID GREETINGS RABBI

 AND HE KISSED HIM

JESUS SAID TO HIM FRIEND DO WHAT YOU CAME TO DO

 THEN THEY CAME UP AND LAID HANDS ON JESUS AND SEIZED HIM

AND BEHOLD ONE OF THOSE WHO WERE WITH JESUS STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND DREW HIS SWORD AND STRUCK THE SERVANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST AND CUT OFF HIS EAR

THEN JESUS SAID TO HIM PUT YOUR SWORD BACK INTO ITS PLACE

FOR ALL WHO TAKE THE SWORD WILL PERISH BY THE SWORD

DO YOU THINK THAT I CANNOT APPEAL TO MY FATHER AND HE WILL AT ONCE SEND ME MORE THAN TWELVE LEGIONS OF ANGELS

BUT HOW THEN SHOULD THE SCRIPTURES BE FULFILLED THAT IT MUST BE SO

 AT THAT HOUR JESUS SAID TO THE CROWDS HAVE YOU COME OUT AS AGAINST A ROBBER WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS TO CAPTURE ME

DAY AFTER DAY I SAT IN THE TEMPLE TEACHING AND YOU DID NOT SEIZE ME

BUT ALL THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE THAT THE SCRIPTURES OF THE PROPHETS MIGHT BE FULFILLED

 THEN ALL THE DISCIPLES LEFT HIM AND FLED

THEN THOSE WHO HAD SEIZED JESUS LED HIM TO CAIAPHAS THE HIGH PRIEST WHERE THE SCRIBES AND THE ELDERS HAD GATHERED

AND PETER WAS FOLLOWING HIM AT A DISTANCE AS FAR AS THE COURTYARD OF THE HIGH PRIEST AND GOING INSIDE HE SAT WITH THE GUARDS TO SEE THE END

NOW THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE WHOLE COUNCIL WERE SEEKING FALSE TESTIMONY AGAINST JESUS THAT THEY MIGHT PUT HIM TO DEATH BUT THEY FOUND NONE THOUGH MANY FALSE WITNESSES CAME FORWARD

AT LAST TWO CAME FORWARD AND SAID THIS MAN SAID 'I AM ABLE TO DESTROY THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND TO REBUILD IT IN THREE DAYS

' AND THE HIGH PRIEST STOOD UP AND SAID HAVE YOU NO ANSWER TO MAKE

WHAT IS IT THAT THESE MEN TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

 BUT JESUS REMAINED SILENT

AND THE HIGH PRIEST SAID TO HIM I ADJURE YOU BY THE LIVING GOD TELL US IF YOU ARE THE CHRIST THE SON OF GOD

 JESUS SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE SAID SO

BUT I TELL YOU FROM NOW ON YOU WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER AND COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN

 THEN THE HIGH PRIEST TORE HIS ROBES AND SAID HE HAS UTTERED BLASPHEMY

WHAT FURTHER WITNESSES DO WE NEED

YOU HAVE NOW HEARD HIS BLASPHEMY

WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT

 THEY ANSWERED HE DESERVES DEATH

 THEN THEY SPIT IN HIS FACE AND STRUCK HIM

AND SOME SLAPPED HIM SAYING PROPHESY TO US YOU CHRIST

WHO IS IT THAT STRUCK YOU

 NOW PETER WAS SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE COURTYARD

AND A SERVANT GIRL CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID YOU ALSO WERE WITH JESUS THE GALILEAN

 BUT HE DENIED IT BEFORE THEM ALL SAYING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN

 AND WHEN HE WENT OUT TO THE ENTRANCE ANOTHER SERVANT GIRL SAW HIM AND SHE SAID TO THE BYSTANDERS THIS MAN WAS WITH JESUS OF NAZARETH

 AND AGAIN HE DENIED IT WITH AN OATH I DO NOT KNOW THE MAN

 AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE BYSTANDERS CAME UP AND SAID TO PETER CERTAINLY YOU TOO ARE ONE OF THEM FOR YOUR ACCENT BETRAYS YOU

 THEN HE BEGAN TO INVOKE A CURSE ON HIMSELF AND TO SWEAR I DO NOT KNOW THE MAN

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE ROOSTER CROWED

AND PETER REMEMBERED THE SAYING OF JESUS BEFORE THE ROOSTER CROWS YOU WILL DENY ME THREE TIMES

 AND HE WENT OUT AND WEPT BITTERLY

WHEN MORNING CAME ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE TOOK COUNSEL AGAINST JESUS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

AND THEY BOUND HIM AND LED HIM AWAY AND DELIVERED HIM OVER TO PILATE THE GOVERNOR

THEN WHEN JUDAS HIS BETRAYER SAW THAT JESUS WAS CONDEMNED HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND BROUGHT BACK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS SAYING I HAVE SINNED BY BETRAYING INNOCENT BLOOD

 THEY SAID WHAT IS THAT TO US

SEE TO IT YOURSELF

 AND THROWING DOWN THE PIECES OF SILVER INTO THE TEMPLE HE DEPARTED AND HE WENT AND HANGED HIMSELF

BUT THE CHIEF PRIESTS TAKING THE PIECES OF SILVER SAID IT IS NOT LAWFUL TO PUT THEM INTO THE TREASURY SINCE IT IS BLOOD MONEY

 SO THEY TOOK COUNSEL AND BOUGHT WITH THEM THE POTTER'S FIELD AS A BURIAL PLACE FOR STRANGERS

THEREFORE THAT FIELD HAS BEEN CALLED THE FIELD OF BLOOD TO THIS DAY

THEN WAS FULFILLED WHAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET JEREMIAH SAYING AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER THE PRICE OF HIM ON WHOM A PRICE HAD BEEN SET BY SOME OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER'S FIELD AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME

 NOW JESUS STOOD BEFORE THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 JESUS SAID YOU HAVE SAID SO

 BUT WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED BY THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS HE GAVE NO ANSWER

THEN PILATE SAID TO HIM DO YOU NOT HEAR HOW MANY THINGS THEY TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

 BUT HE GAVE HIM NO ANSWER NOT EVEN TO A SINGLE CHARGE SO THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS GREATLY AMAZED

NOW AT THE FEAST THE GOVERNOR WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RELEASE FOR THE CROWD ANY ONE PRISONER WHOM THEY WANTED

AND THEY HAD THEN A NOTORIOUS PRISONER CALLED BARABBAS

SO WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED PILATE SAID TO THEM WHOM DO YOU WANT ME TO RELEASE FOR YOU BARABBAS OR JESUS WHO IS CALLED CHRIST

 FOR HE KNEW THAT IT WAS OUT OF ENVY THAT THEY HAD DELIVERED HIM UP

BESIDES WHILE HE WAS SITTING ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT HIS WIFE SENT WORD TO HIM HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT RIGHTEOUS MAN FOR I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BECAUSE OF HIM TODAY IN A DREAM

 NOW THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS PERSUADED THE CROWD TO ASK FOR BARABBAS AND DESTROY JESUS

THE GOVERNOR AGAIN SAID TO THEM WHICH OF THE TWO DO YOU WANT ME TO RELEASE FOR YOU

 AND THEY SAID BARABBAS

 PILATE SAID TO THEM THEN WHAT SHALL I DO WITH JESUS WHO IS CALLED CHRIST

 THEY ALL SAID LET HIM BE CRUCIFIED

 AND HE SAID WHY WHAT EVIL HAS HE DONE

 BUT THEY SHOUTED ALL THE MORE LET HIM BE CRUCIFIED

 SO WHEN PILATE SAW THAT HE WAS GAINING NOTHING BUT RATHER THAT A RIOT WAS BEGINNING HE TOOK WATER AND WASHED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE CROWD SAYING I AM INNOCENT OF THIS MAN'S BLOOD; SEE TO IT YOURSELVES

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED HIS BLOOD BE ON US AND ON OUR CHILDREN

 THEN HE RELEASED FOR THEM BARABBAS AND HAVING SCOURGED JESUS DELIVERED HIM TO BE CRUCIFIED

THEN THE SOLDIERS OF THE GOVERNOR TOOK JESUS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S HEADQUARTERS AND THEY GATHERED THE WHOLE BATTALION BEFORE HIM

AND THEY STRIPPED HIM AND PUT A SCARLET ROBE ON HIM AND TWISTING TOGETHER A CROWN OF THORNS THEY PUT IT ON HIS HEAD AND PUT A REED IN HIS RIGHT HAND

AND KNEELING BEFORE HIM THEY MOCKED HIM SAYING HAIL KING OF THE JEWS

 AND THEY SPIT ON HIM AND TOOK THE REED AND STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD

AND WHEN THEY HAD MOCKED HIM THEY STRIPPED HIM OF THE ROBE AND PUT HIS OWN CLOTHES ON HIM AND LED HIM AWAY TO CRUCIFY HIM

AS THEY WENT OUT THEY FOUND A MAN OF CYRENE SIMON BY NAME

THEY COMPELLED THIS MAN TO CARRY HIS CROSS

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A PLACE CALLED GOLGOTHA WHICH MEANS PLACE OF A SKULL THEY OFFERED HIM WINE TO DRINK MIXED WITH GALL BUT WHEN HE TASTED IT HE WOULD NOT DRINK IT

AND WHEN THEY HAD CRUCIFIED HIM THEY DIVIDED HIS GARMENTS AMONG THEM BY CASTING LOTS

THEN THEY SAT DOWN AND KEPT WATCH OVER HIM THERE

AND OVER HIS HEAD THEY PUT THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM WHICH READ THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS

 THEN TWO ROBBERS WERE CRUCIFIED WITH HIM ONE ON THE RIGHT AND ONE ON THE LEFT

AND THOSE WHO PASSED BY DERIDED HIM WAGGING THEIR HEADS AND SAYING YOU WHO WOULD DESTROY THE TEMPLE AND REBUILD IT IN THREE DAYS SAVE YOURSELF

IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD COME DOWN FROM THE CROSS

 SO ALSO THE CHIEF PRIESTS WITH THE SCRIBES AND ELDERS MOCKED HIM SAYING HE SAVED OTHERS; HE CANNOT SAVE HIMSELF

HE IS THE KING OF ISRAEL; LET HIM COME DOWN NOW FROM THE CROSS AND WE WILL BELIEVE IN HIM

HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET GOD DELIVER HIM NOW IF HE DESIRES HIM

FOR HE SAID 'I AM THE SON OF GOD

' AND THE ROBBERS WHO WERE CRUCIFIED WITH HIM ALSO REVILED HIM IN THE SAME WAY

NOW FROM THE SIXTH HOUR THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LAND UNTIL THE NINTH HOUR

AND ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR JESUS CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE SAYING ELI ELI LEMA SABACHTHANI

 THAT IS MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME

 AND SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS HEARING IT SAID THIS MAN IS CALLING ELIJAH

 AND ONE OF THEM AT ONCE RAN AND TOOK A SPONGE FILLED IT WITH SOUR WINE AND PUT IT ON A REED AND GAVE IT TO HIM TO DRINK

BUT THE OTHERS SAID WAIT LET US SEE WHETHER ELIJAH WILL COME TO SAVE HIM

 AND JESUS CRIED OUT AGAIN WITH A LOUD VOICE AND YIELDED UP HIS SPIRIT

AND BEHOLD THE CURTAIN OF THE TEMPLE WAS TORN IN TWO FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

AND THE EARTH SHOOK AND THE ROCKS WERE SPLIT

THE TOMBS ALSO WERE OPENED

AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WERE RAISED AND COMING OUT OF THE TOMBS AFTER HIS RESURRECTION THEY WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED TO MANY

WHEN THE CENTURION AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM KEEPING WATCH OVER JESUS SAW THE EARTHQUAKE AND WHAT TOOK PLACE THEY WERE FILLED WITH AWE AND SAID TRULY THIS WAS THE SON OF GOD

 THERE WERE ALSO MANY WOMEN THERE LOOKING ON FROM A DISTANCE WHO HAD FOLLOWED JESUS FROM GALILEE MINISTERING TO HIM AMONG WHOM WERE MARY MAGDALENE AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JAMES AND JOSEPH AND THE MOTHER OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE

WHEN IT WAS EVENING THERE CAME A RICH MAN FROM ARIMATHEA NAMED JOSEPH WHO ALSO WAS A DISCIPLE OF JESUS

HE WENT TO PILATE AND ASKED FOR THE BODY OF JESUS

THEN PILATE ORDERED IT TO BE GIVEN TO HIM

AND JOSEPH TOOK THE BODY AND WRAPPED IT IN A CLEAN LINEN SHROUD AND LAID IT IN HIS OWN NEW TOMB WHICH HE HAD CUT IN THE ROCK

AND HE ROLLED A GREAT STONE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TOMB AND WENT AWAY

MARY MAGDALENE AND THE OTHER MARY WERE THERE SITTING OPPOSITE THE TOMB

NEXT DAY THAT IS AFTER THE DAY OF PREPARATION THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PHARISEES GATHERED BEFORE PILATE AND SAID SIR WE REMEMBER HOW THAT IMPOSTOR SAID WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE 'AFTER THREE DAYS I WILL RISE

' THEREFORE ORDER THE TOMB TO BE MADE SECURE UNTIL THE THIRD DAY LEST HIS DISCIPLES GO AND STEAL HIM AWAY AND TELL THE PEOPLE 'HE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD' AND THE LAST FRAUD WILL BE WORSE THAN THE FIRST

 PILATE SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE A GUARD OF SOLDIERS

GO MAKE IT AS SECURE AS YOU CAN

 SO THEY WENT AND MADE THE TOMB SECURE BY SEALING THE STONE AND SETTING A GUARD

NOW AFTER THE SABBATH TOWARD THE DAWN OF THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK MARY MAGDALENE AND THE OTHER MARY WENT TO SEE THE TOMB

AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE FOR AN ANGEL OF THE LORD DESCENDED FROM HEAVEN AND CAME AND ROLLED BACK THE STONE AND SAT ON IT

HIS APPEARANCE WAS LIKE LIGHTNING AND HIS CLOTHING WHITE AS SNOW

AND FOR FEAR OF HIM THE GUARDS TREMBLED AND BECAME LIKE DEAD MEN

BUT THE ANGEL SAID TO THE WOMEN DO NOT BE AFRAID FOR I KNOW THAT YOU SEEK JESUS WHO WAS CRUCIFIED

HE IS NOT HERE FOR HE HAS RISEN AS HE SAID

COME SEE THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY

THEN GO QUICKLY AND TELL HIS DISCIPLES THAT HE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD AND BEHOLD HE IS GOING BEFORE YOU TO GALILEE; THERE YOU WILL SEE HIM

SEE I HAVE TOLD YOU

 SO THEY DEPARTED QUICKLY FROM THE TOMB WITH FEAR AND GREAT JOY AND RAN TO TELL HIS DISCIPLES

AND BEHOLD JESUS MET THEM AND SAID GREETINGS

 AND THEY CAME UP AND TOOK HOLD OF HIS FEET AND WORSHIPED HIM

THEN JESUS SAID TO THEM DO NOT BE AFRAID; GO AND TELL MY BROTHERS TO GO TO GALILEE AND THERE THEY WILL SEE ME

 WHILE THEY WERE GOING BEHOLD SOME OF THE GUARD WENT INTO THE CITY AND TOLD THE CHIEF PRIESTS ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE

AND WHEN THEY HAD ASSEMBLED WITH THE ELDERS AND TAKEN COUNSEL THEY GAVE A SUFFICIENT SUM OF MONEY TO THE SOLDIERS AND SAID TELL PEOPLE 'HIS DISCIPLES CAME BY NIGHT AND STOLE HIM AWAY WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP

' AND IF THIS COMES TO THE GOVERNOR'S EARS WE WILL SATISFY HIM AND KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE

 SO THEY TOOK THE MONEY AND DID AS THEY WERE DIRECTED

AND THIS STORY HAS BEEN SPREAD AMONG THE JEWS TO THIS DAY

NOW THE ELEVEN DISCIPLES WENT TO GALILEE TO THE MOUNTAIN TO WHICH JESUS HAD DIRECTED THEM

AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM THEY WORSHIPED HIM BUT SOME DOUBTED

AND JESUS CAME AND SAID TO THEM ALL AUTHORITY IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME

GO THEREFORE AND MAKE DISCIPLES OF ALL NATIONS BAPTIZING THEM IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TEACHING THEM TO OBSERVE ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

AND BEHOLD I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS TO THE END OF THE AGE

 THESSALONIANSPAUL SILVANUS AND TIMOTHYTO THE CHURCH OF THE THESSALONIANS IN GOD THE FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRISTGRACE TO YOU AND PEACE

WE GIVE THANKS TO GOD ALWAYS FOR ALL OF YOU CONSTANTLY MENTIONING YOU IN OUR PRAYERS REMEMBERING BEFORE OUR GOD AND FATHER YOUR WORK OF FAITH AND LABOR OF LOVE AND STEADFASTNESS OF HOPE IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

FOR WE KNOW BROTHERS LOVED BY GOD THAT HE HAS CHOSEN YOU BECAUSE OUR GOSPEL CAME TO YOU NOT ONLY IN WORD BUT ALSO IN POWER AND IN THE HOLY SPIRIT AND WITH FULL CONVICTION

YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF MEN WE PROVED TO BE AMONG YOU FOR YOUR SAKE

AND YOU BECAME IMITATORS OF US AND OF THE LORD FOR YOU RECEIVED THE WORD IN MUCH AFFLICTION WITH THE JOY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT SO THAT YOU BECAME AN EXAMPLE TO ALL THE BELIEVERS IN MACEDONIA AND IN ACHAIA

FOR NOT ONLY HAS THE WORD OF THE LORD SOUNDED FORTH FROM YOU IN MACEDONIA AND ACHAIA BUT YOUR FAITH IN GOD HAS GONE FORTH EVERYWHERE SO THAT WE NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING

FOR THEY THEMSELVES REPORT CONCERNING US THE KIND OF RECEPTION WE HAD AMONG YOU AND HOW YOU TURNED TO GOD FROM IDOLS TO SERVE THE LIVING AND TRUE GOD AND TO WAIT FOR HIS SON FROM HEAVEN WHOM HE RAISED FROM THE DEAD JESUS WHO DELIVERS US FROM THE WRATH TO COME

FOR YOU YOURSELVES KNOW BROTHERS THAT OUR COMING TO YOU WAS NOT IN VAIN

BUT THOUGH WE HAD ALREADY SUFFERED AND BEEN SHAMEFULLY TREATED AT PHILIPPI AS YOU KNOW WE HAD BOLDNESS IN OUR GOD TO DECLARE TO YOU THE GOSPEL OF GOD IN THE MIDST OF MUCH CONFLICT

FOR OUR APPEAL DOES NOT SPRING FROM ERROR OR IMPURITY OR ANY ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE BUT JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY GOD TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE GOSPEL SO WE SPEAK NOT TO PLEASE MAN BUT TO PLEASE GOD WHO TESTS OUR HEARTS

FOR WE NEVER CAME WITH WORDS OF FLATTERY AS YOU KNOW NOR WITH A PRETEXT FOR GREEDGOD IS WITNESS

NOR DID WE SEEK GLORY FROM PEOPLE WHETHER FROM YOU OR FROM OTHERS THOUGH WE COULD HAVE MADE DEMANDS AS APOSTLES OF CHRIST

BUT WE WERE GENTLE AMONG YOU LIKE A NURSING MOTHER TAKING CARE OF HER OWN CHILDREN

SO BEING AFFECTIONATELY DESIROUS OF YOU WE WERE READY TO SHARE WITH YOU NOT ONLY THE GOSPEL OF GOD BUT ALSO OUR OWN SELVES BECAUSE YOU HAD BECOME VERY DEAR TO US

FOR YOU REMEMBER BROTHERS OUR LABOR AND TOIL WE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE A BURDEN TO ANY OF YOU WHILE WE PROCLAIMED TO YOU THE GOSPEL OF GOD

YOU ARE WITNESSES AND GOD ALSO HOW HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS AND BLAMELESS WAS OUR CONDUCT TOWARD YOU BELIEVERS

FOR YOU KNOW HOW LIKE A FATHER WITH HIS CHILDREN WE EXHORTED EACH ONE OF YOU AND ENCOURAGED YOU AND CHARGED YOU TO WALK IN A MANNER WORTHY OF GOD WHO CALLS YOU INTO HIS OWN KINGDOM AND GLORY

AND WE ALSO THANK GOD CONSTANTLY FOR THIS THAT WHEN YOU RECEIVED THE WORD OF GOD WHICH YOU HEARD FROM US YOU ACCEPTED IT NOT AS THE WORD OF MEN BUT AS WHAT IT REALLY IS THE WORD OF GOD WHICH IS AT WORK IN YOU BELIEVERS

FOR YOU BROTHERS BECAME IMITATORS OF THE CHURCHES OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS THAT ARE IN JUDEA

FOR YOU SUFFERED THE SAME THINGS FROM YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN AS THEY DID FROM THE JEWS WHO KILLED BOTH THE LORD JESUS AND THE PROPHETS AND DROVE US OUT AND DISPLEASE GOD AND OPPOSE ALL MANKIND BY HINDERING US FROM SPEAKING TO THE GENTILES THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVEDSO AS ALWAYS TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF THEIR SINS

BUT GOD'S WRATH HAS COME UPON THEM AT LAST

BUT SINCE WE WERE TORN AWAY FROM YOU BROTHERS FOR A SHORT TIME IN PERSON NOT IN HEART WE ENDEAVORED THE MORE EAGERLY AND WITH GREAT DESIRE TO SEE YOU FACE TO FACE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO COME TO YOUI PAUL AGAIN AND AGAINBUT SATAN HINDERED US

FOR WHAT IS OUR HOPE OR JOY OR CROWN OF BOASTING BEFORE OUR LORD JESUS AT HIS COMING

IS IT NOT YOU

FOR YOU ARE OUR GLORY AND JOY

THEREFORE WHEN WE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER WE WERE WILLING TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT ATHENS ALONE AND WE SENT TIMOTHY OUR BROTHER AND GOD'S COWORKER IN THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST TO ESTABLISH AND EXHORT YOU IN YOUR FAITH THAT NO ONE BE MOVED BY THESE AFFLICTIONS

FOR YOU YOURSELVES KNOW THAT WE ARE DESTINED FOR THIS

FOR WHEN WE WERE WITH YOU WE KEPT TELLING YOU BEFOREHAND THAT WE WERE TO SUFFER AFFLICTION JUST AS IT HAS COME TO PASS AND JUST AS YOU KNOW

FOR THIS REASON WHEN I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER I SENT TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR FAITH FOR FEAR THAT SOMEHOW THE TEMPTER HAD TEMPTED YOU AND OUR LABOR WOULD BE IN VAIN

BUT NOW THAT TIMOTHY HAS COME TO US FROM YOU AND HAS BROUGHT US THE GOOD NEWS OF YOUR FAITH AND LOVE AND REPORTED THAT YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER US KINDLY AND LONG TO SEE US AS WE LONG TO SEE YOU FOR THIS REASON BROTHERS IN ALL OUR DISTRESS AND AFFLICTION WE HAVE BEEN COMFORTED ABOUT YOU THROUGH YOUR FAITH

FOR NOW WE LIVE IF YOU ARE STANDING FAST IN THE LORD

FOR WHAT THANKSGIVING CAN WE RETURN TO GOD FOR YOU FOR ALL THE JOY THAT WE FEEL FOR YOUR SAKE BEFORE OUR GOD AS WE PRAY MOST EARNESTLY NIGHT AND DAY THAT WE MAY SEE YOU FACE TO FACE AND SUPPLY WHAT IS LACKING IN YOUR FAITH

NOW MAY OUR GOD AND FATHER HIMSELF AND OUR LORD JESUS DIRECT OUR WAY TO YOU AND MAY THE LORD MAKE YOU INCREASE AND ABOUND IN LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND FOR ALL AS WE DO FOR YOU SO THAT HE MAY ESTABLISH YOUR HEARTS BLAMELESS IN HOLINESS BEFORE OUR GOD AND FATHER AT THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS WITH ALL HIS SAINTS

FINALLY THEN BROTHERS WE ASK AND URGE YOU IN THE LORD JESUS THAT AS YOU RECEIVED FROM US HOW YOU OUGHT TO LIVE AND TO PLEASE GOD JUST AS YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU DO SO MORE AND MORE

FOR YOU KNOW WHAT INSTRUCTIONS WE GAVE YOU THROUGH THE LORD JESUS

FOR THIS IS THE WILL OF GOD YOUR SANCTIFICATION THAT YOU ABSTAIN FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY; THAT EACH ONE OF YOU KNOW HOW TO CONTROL HIS OWN BODY IN HOLINESS AND HONOR NOT IN THE PASSION OF LUST LIKE THE GENTILES WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD; THAT NO ONE TRANSGRESS AND WRONG HIS BROTHER IN THIS MATTER BECAUSE THE LORD IS AN AVENGER IN ALL THESE THINGS AS WE TOLD YOU BEFOREHAND AND SOLEMNLY WARNED YOU

FOR GOD HAS NOT CALLED US FOR IMPURITY BUT IN HOLINESS

THEREFORE WHOEVER DISREGARDS THIS DISREGARDS NOT MAN BUT GOD WHO GIVES HIS HOLY SPIRIT TO YOU

NOW CONCERNING BROTHERLY LOVE YOU HAVE NO NEED FOR ANYONE TO WRITE TO YOU FOR YOU YOURSELVES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY GOD TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER FOR THAT INDEED IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO ALL THE BROTHERS THROUGHOUT MACEDONIA

BUT WE URGE YOU BROTHERS TO DO THIS MORE AND MORE AND TO ASPIRE TO LIVE QUIETLY AND TO MIND YOUR OWN AFFAIRS AND TO WORK WITH YOUR HANDS AS WE INSTRUCTED YOU SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE PROPERLY BEFORE OUTSIDERS AND BE DEPENDENT ON NO ONE

BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE UNINFORMED BROTHERS ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ASLEEP THAT YOU MAY NOT GRIEVE AS OTHERS DO WHO HAVE NO HOPE

FOR SINCE WE BELIEVE THAT JESUS DIED AND ROSE AGAIN EVEN SO THROUGH JESUS GOD WILL BRING WITH HIM THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP

FOR THIS WE DECLARE TO YOU BY A WORD FROM THE LORD THAT WE WHO ARE ALIVE WHO ARE LEFT UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD WILL NOT PRECEDE THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP

FOR THE LORD HIMSELF WILL DESCEND FROM HEAVEN WITH A CRY OF COMMAND WITH THE VOICE OF AN ARCHANGEL AND WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET OF GOD

AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST

THEN WE WHO ARE ALIVE WHO ARE LEFT WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM IN THE CLOUDS TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR AND SO WE WILL ALWAYS BE WITH THE LORD

THEREFORE ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER WITH THESE WORDS

NOW CONCERNING THE TIMES AND THE SEASONS BROTHERS YOU HAVE NO NEED TO HAVE ANYTHING WRITTEN TO YOU

FOR YOU YOURSELVES ARE FULLY AWARE THAT THE DAY OF THE LORD WILL COME LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT

WHILE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE IS PEACE AND SECURITY THEN SUDDEN DESTRUCTION WILL COME UPON THEM AS LABOR PAINS COME UPON A PREGNANT WOMAN AND THEY WILL NOT ESCAPE

BUT YOU ARE NOT IN DARKNESS BROTHERS FOR THAT DAY TO SURPRISE YOU LIKE A THIEF

FOR YOU ARE ALL CHILDREN OF LIGHT CHILDREN OF THE DAY

WE ARE NOT OF THE NIGHT OR OF THE DARKNESS

SO THEN LET US NOT SLEEP AS OTHERS DO BUT LET US KEEP AWAKE AND BE SOBER

FOR THOSE WHO SLEEP SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THOSE WHO GET DRUNK ARE DRUNK AT NIGHT

BUT SINCE WE BELONG TO THE DAY LET US BE SOBER HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF FAITH AND LOVE AND FOR A HELMET THE HOPE OF SALVATION

FOR GOD HAS NOT DESTINED US FOR WRATH BUT TO OBTAIN SALVATION THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO DIED FOR US SO THAT WHETHER WE ARE AWAKE OR ASLEEP WE MIGHT LIVE WITH HIM

THEREFORE ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER AND BUILD ONE ANOTHER UP JUST AS YOU ARE DOING

WE ASK YOU BROTHERS TO RESPECT THOSE WHO LABOR AMONG YOU AND ARE OVER YOU IN THE LORD AND ADMONISH YOU AND TO ESTEEM THEM VERY HIGHLY IN LOVE BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK

BE AT PEACE AMONG YOURSELVES

AND WE URGE YOU BROTHERS ADMONISH THE IDLE ENCOURAGE THE FAINTHEARTED HELP THE WEAK BE PATIENT WITH THEM ALL

SEE THAT NO ONE REPAYS ANYONE EVIL FOR EVIL BUT ALWAYS SEEK TO DO GOOD TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO EVERYONE

REJOICE ALWAYS PRAY WITHOUT CEASING GIVE THANKS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES; FOR THIS IS THE WILL OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS FOR YOU

DO NOT QUENCH THE SPIRIT

DO NOT DESPISE PROPHECIES BUT TEST EVERYTHING; HOLD FAST WHAT IS GOOD

ABSTAIN FROM EVERY FORM OF EVIL

NOW MAY THE GOD OF PEACE HIMSELF SANCTIFY YOU COMPLETELY AND MAY YOUR WHOLE SPIRIT AND SOUL AND BODY BE KEPT BLAMELESS AT THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

HE WHO CALLS YOU IS FAITHFUL; HE WILL SURELY DO IT

BROTHERS PRAY FOR US

GREET ALL THE BROTHERS WITH A HOLY KISS

I PUT YOU UNDER OATH BEFORE THE LORD TO HAVE THIS LETTER READ TO ALL THE BROTHERS

THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOU

DANIELIN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE REIGN OF JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME TO JERUSALEM AND BESIEGED IT

AND THE LORD GAVE JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH INTO HIS HAND WITH SOME OF THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD

AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE LAND OF SHINAR TO THE HOUSE OF HIS GOD AND PLACED THE VESSELS IN THE TREASURY OF HIS GOD

THEN THE KING COMMANDED ASHPENAZ HIS CHIEF EUNUCH TO BRING SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BOTH OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND OF THE NOBILITY YOUTHS WITHOUT BLEMISH OF GOOD APPEARANCE AND SKILLFUL IN ALL WISDOM ENDOWED WITH KNOWLEDGE UNDERSTANDING LEARNING AND COMPETENT TO STAND IN THE KING'S PALACE AND TO TEACH THEM THE LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE OF THE CHALDEANS

THE KING ASSIGNED THEM A DAILY PORTION OF THE FOOD THAT THE KING ATE AND OF THE WINE THAT HE DRANK

THEY WERE TO BE EDUCATED FOR THREE YEARS AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME THEY WERE TO STAND BEFORE THE KING

AMONG THESE WERE DANIEL HANANIAH MISHAEL AND AZARIAH OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH

AND THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS GAVE THEM NAMES DANIEL HE CALLED BELTESHAZZAR HANANIAH HE CALLED SHADRACH MISHAEL HE CALLED MESHACH AND AZARIAH HE CALLED ABEDNEGO

BUT DANIEL RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NOT DEFILE HIMSELF WITH THE KING'S FOOD OR WITH THE WINE THAT HE DRANK

THEREFORE HE ASKED THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS TO ALLOW HIM NOT TO DEFILE HIMSELF

AND GOD GAVE DANIEL FAVOR AND COMPASSION IN THE SIGHT OF THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS AND THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS SAID TO DANIEL I FEAR MY LORD THE KING WHO ASSIGNED YOUR FOOD AND YOUR DRINK; FOR WHY SHOULD HE SEE THAT YOU WERE IN WORSE CONDITION THAN THE YOUTHS WHO ARE OF YOUR OWN AGE

SO YOU WOULD ENDANGER MY HEAD WITH THE KING

 THEN DANIEL SAID TO THE STEWARD WHOM THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS HAD ASSIGNED OVER DANIEL HANANIAH MISHAEL AND AZARIAH TEST YOUR SERVANTS FOR TEN DAYS; LET US BE GIVEN VEGETABLES TO EAT AND WATER TO DRINK

THEN LET OUR APPEARANCE AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE YOUTHS WHO EAT THE KING'S FOOD BE OBSERVED BY YOU AND DEAL WITH YOUR SERVANTS ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SEE

 SO HE LISTENED TO THEM IN THIS MATTER AND TESTED THEM FOR TEN DAYS

AT THE END OF TEN DAYS IT WAS SEEN THAT THEY WERE BETTER IN APPEARANCE AND FATTER IN FLESH THAN ALL THE YOUTHS WHO ATE THE KING'S FOOD

SO THE STEWARD TOOK AWAY THEIR FOOD AND THE WINE THEY WERE TO DRINK AND GAVE THEM VEGETABLES

AS FOR THESE FOUR YOUTHS GOD GAVE THEM LEARNING AND SKILL IN ALL LITERATURE AND WISDOM AND DANIEL HAD UNDERSTANDING IN ALL VISIONS AND DREAMS

AT THE END OF THE TIME WHEN THE KING HAD COMMANDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS BROUGHT THEM IN BEFORE NEBUCHADNEZZAR

AND THE KING SPOKE WITH THEM AND AMONG ALL OF THEM NONE WAS FOUND LIKE DANIEL HANANIAH MISHAEL AND AZARIAH

THEREFORE THEY STOOD BEFORE THE KING

AND IN EVERY MATTER OF WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHICH THE KING INQUIRED OF THEM HE FOUND THEM TEN TIMES BETTER THAN ALL THE MAGICIANS AND ENCHANTERS THAT WERE IN ALL HIS KINGDOM

AND DANIEL WAS THERE UNTIL THE FIRST YEAR OF KING CYRUS

IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE REIGN OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD DREAMS; HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED AND HIS SLEEP LEFT HIM

THEN THE KING COMMANDED THAT THE MAGICIANS THE ENCHANTERS THE SORCERERS AND THE CHALDEANS BE SUMMONED TO TELL THE KING HIS DREAMS

SO THEY CAME IN AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING

AND THE KING SAID TO THEM I HAD A DREAM AND MY SPIRIT IS TROUBLED TO KNOW THE DREAM

 THEN THE CHALDEANS SAID TO THE KING IN ARAMAIC O KING LIVE FOREVER

TELL YOUR SERVANTS THE DREAM AND WE WILL SHOW THE INTERPRETATION

 THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID TO THE CHALDEANS THE WORD FROM ME IS FIRM IF YOU DO NOT MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION YOU SHALL BE TORN LIMB FROM LIMB AND YOUR HOUSES SHALL BE LAID IN RUINS

BUT IF YOU SHOW THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION YOU SHALL RECEIVE FROM ME GIFTS AND REWARDS AND GREAT HONOR

THEREFORE SHOW ME THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION

 THEY ANSWERED A SECOND TIME AND SAID LET THE KING TELL HIS SERVANTS THE DREAM AND WE WILL SHOW ITS INTERPRETATION

 THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO GAIN TIME BECAUSE YOU SEE THAT THE WORD FROM ME IS FIRM IF YOU DO NOT MAKE THE DREAM KNOWN TO ME THERE IS BUT ONE SENTENCE FOR YOU

YOU HAVE AGREED TO SPEAK LYING AND CORRUPT WORDS BEFORE ME TILL THE TIMES CHANGE

THEREFORE TELL ME THE DREAM AND I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU CAN SHOW ME ITS INTERPRETATION

 THE CHALDEANS ANSWERED THE KING AND SAID THERE IS NOT A MAN ON EARTH WHO CAN MEET THE KING'S DEMAND FOR NO GREAT AND POWERFUL KING HAS ASKED SUCH A THING OF ANY MAGICIAN OR ENCHANTER OR CHALDEAN

THE THING THAT THE KING ASKS IS DIFFICULT AND NO ONE CAN SHOW IT TO THE KING EXCEPT THE GODS WHOSE DWELLING IS NOT WITH FLESH

 BECAUSE OF THIS THE KING WAS ANGRY AND VERY FURIOUS AND COMMANDED THAT ALL THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON BE DESTROYED

SO THE DECREE WENT OUT AND THE WISE MEN WERE ABOUT TO BE KILLED; AND THEY SOUGHT DANIEL AND HIS COMPANIONS TO KILL THEM

THEN DANIEL REPLIED WITH PRUDENCE AND DISCRETION TO ARIOCH THE CAPTAIN OF THE KING'S GUARD WHO HAD GONE OUT TO KILL THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON

HE DECLARED TO ARIOCH THE KING'S CAPTAIN WHY IS THE DECREE OF THE KING SO URGENT

 THEN ARIOCH MADE THE MATTER KNOWN TO DANIEL

AND DANIEL WENT IN AND REQUESTED THE KING TO APPOINT HIM A TIME THAT HE MIGHT SHOW THE INTERPRETATION TO THE KING

THEN DANIEL WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND MADE THE MATTER KNOWN TO HANANIAH MISHAEL AND AZARIAH HIS COMPANIONS AND TOLD THEM TO SEEK MERCY FROM THE GOD OF HEAVEN CONCERNING THIS MYSTERY SO THAT DANIEL AND HIS COMPANIONS MIGHT NOT BE DESTROYED WITH THE REST OF THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON

THEN THE MYSTERY WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL IN A VISION OF THE NIGHT

THEN DANIEL BLESSED THE GOD OF HEAVEN

DANIEL ANSWERED AND SAID BLESSED BE THE NAME OF GOD FOREVER AND EVER TO WHOM BELONG WISDOM AND MIGHT

HE CHANGES TIMES AND SEASONS; HE REMOVES KINGS AND SETS UP KINGS; HE GIVES WISDOM TO THE WISE AND KNOWLEDGE TO THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERSTANDING; HE REVEALS DEEP AND HIDDEN THINGS; HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM

TO YOU O GOD OF MY FATHERS I GIVE THANKS AND PRAISE FOR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME WISDOM AND MIGHT AND HAVE NOW MADE KNOWN TO ME WHAT WE ASKED OF YOU FOR YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO US THE KING'S MATTER

 THEREFORE DANIEL WENT IN TO ARIOCH WHOM THE KING HAD APPOINTED TO DESTROY THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON

HE WENT AND SAID THUS TO HIM DO NOT DESTROY THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON; BRING ME IN BEFORE THE KING AND I WILL SHOW THE KING THE INTERPRETATION

 THEN ARIOCH BROUGHT IN DANIEL BEFORE THE KING IN HASTE AND SAID THUS TO HIM I HAVE FOUND AMONG THE EXILES FROM JUDAH A MAN WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN TO THE KING THE INTERPRETATION

 THE KING SAID TO DANIEL WHOSE NAME WAS BELTESHAZZAR ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE DREAM THAT I HAVE SEEN AND ITS INTERPRETATION

 DANIEL ANSWERED THE KING AND SAID NO WISE MEN ENCHANTERS MAGICIANS OR ASTROLOGERS CAN SHOW TO THE KING THE MYSTERY THAT THE KING HAS ASKED BUT THERE IS A GOD IN HEAVEN WHO REVEALS MYSTERIES AND HE HAS MADE KNOWN TO KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHAT WILL BE IN THE LATTER DAYS

YOUR DREAM AND THE VISIONS OF YOUR HEAD AS YOU LAY IN BED ARE THESE TO YOU O KING AS YOU LAY IN BED CAME THOUGHTS OF WHAT WOULD BE AFTER THIS AND HE WHO REVEALS MYSTERIES MADE KNOWN TO YOU WHAT IS TO BE

BUT AS FOR ME THIS MYSTERY HAS BEEN REVEALED TO ME NOT BECAUSE OF ANY WISDOM THAT I HAVE MORE THAN ALL THE LIVING BUT IN ORDER THAT THE INTERPRETATION MAY BE MADE KNOWN TO THE KING AND THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE THOUGHTS OF YOUR MIND

YOU SAW O KING AND BEHOLD A GREAT IMAGE

THIS IMAGE MIGHTY AND OF EXCEEDING BRIGHTNESS STOOD BEFORE YOU AND ITS APPEARANCE WAS FRIGHTENING

THE HEAD OF THIS IMAGE WAS OF FINE GOLD ITS CHEST AND ARMS OF SILVER ITS MIDDLE AND THIGHS OF BRONZE ITS LEGS OF IRON ITS FEET PARTLY OF IRON AND PARTLY OF CLAY

AS YOU LOOKED A STONE WAS CUT OUT BY NO HUMAN HAND AND IT STRUCK THE IMAGE ON ITS FEET OF IRON AND CLAY AND BROKE THEM IN PIECES

THEN THE IRON THE CLAY THE BRONZE THE SILVER AND THE GOLD ALL TOGETHER WERE BROKEN IN PIECES AND BECAME LIKE THE CHAFF OF THE SUMMER THRESHING FLOORS; AND THE WIND CARRIED THEM AWAY SO THAT NOT A TRACE OF THEM COULD BE FOUND

BUT THE STONE THAT STRUCK THE IMAGE BECAME A GREAT MOUNTAIN AND FILLED THE WHOLE EARTH

THIS WAS THE DREAM

NOW WE WILL TELL THE KING ITS INTERPRETATION

YOU O KING THE KING OF KINGS TO WHOM THE GOD OF HEAVEN HAS GIVEN THE KINGDOM THE POWER AND THE MIGHT AND THE GLORY AND INTO WHOSE HAND HE HAS GIVEN WHEREVER THEY DWELL THE CHILDREN OF MAN THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS MAKING YOU RULE OVER THEM ALLYOU ARE THE HEAD OF GOLD

ANOTHER KINGDOM INFERIOR TO YOU SHALL ARISE AFTER YOU AND YET A THIRD KINGDOM OF BRONZE WHICH SHALL RULE OVER ALL THE EARTH

AND THERE SHALL BE A FOURTH KINGDOM STRONG AS IRON BECAUSE IRON BREAKS TO PIECES AND SHATTERS ALL THINGS

AND LIKE IRON THAT CRUSHES IT SHALL BREAK AND CRUSH ALL THESE

AND AS YOU SAW THE FEET AND TOES PARTLY OF POTTER'S CLAY AND PARTLY OF IRON IT SHALL BE A DIVIDED KINGDOM BUT SOME OF THE FIRMNESS OF IRON SHALL BE IN IT JUST AS YOU SAW IRON MIXED WITH THE SOFT CLAY

AND AS THE TOES OF THE FEET WERE PARTLY IRON AND PARTLY CLAY SO THE KINGDOM SHALL BE PARTLY STRONG AND PARTLY BRITTLE

AS YOU SAW THE IRON MIXED WITH SOFT CLAY SO THEY WILL MIX WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MARRIAGE BUT THEY WILL NOT HOLD TOGETHER JUST AS IRON DOES NOT MIX WITH CLAY

AND IN THE DAYS OF THOSE KINGS THE GOD OF HEAVEN WILL SET UP A KINGDOM THAT SHALL NEVER BE DESTROYED NOR SHALL THE KINGDOM BE LEFT TO ANOTHER PEOPLE

IT SHALL BREAK IN PIECES ALL THESE KINGDOMS AND BRING THEM TO AN END AND IT SHALL STAND FOREVER JUST AS YOU SAW THAT A STONE WAS CUT FROM A MOUNTAIN BY NO HUMAN HAND AND THAT IT BROKE IN PIECES THE IRON THE BRONZE THE CLAY THE SILVER AND THE GOLD

A GREAT GOD HAS MADE KNOWN TO THE KING WHAT SHALL BE AFTER THIS

THE DREAM IS CERTAIN AND ITS INTERPRETATION SURE

 THEN KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FELL UPON HIS FACE AND PAID HOMAGE TO DANIEL AND COMMANDED THAT AN OFFERING AND INCENSE BE OFFERED UP TO HIM

THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID TO DANIEL TRULY YOUR GOD IS GOD OF GODS AND LORD OF KINGS AND A REVEALER OF MYSTERIES FOR YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REVEAL THIS MYSTERY

 THEN THE KING GAVE DANIEL HIGH HONORS AND MANY GREAT GIFTS AND MADE HIM RULER OVER THE WHOLE PROVINCE OF BABYLON AND CHIEF PREFECT OVER ALL THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON

DANIEL MADE A REQUEST OF THE KING AND HE APPOINTED SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO OVER THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON

BUT DANIEL REMAINED AT THE KING'S COURT

KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR MADE AN IMAGE OF GOLD WHOSE HEIGHT WAS SIXTY CUBITS AND ITS BREADTH SIX CUBITS

HE SET IT UP ON THE PLAIN OF DURA IN THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON

THEN KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SENT TO GATHER THE SATRAPS THE PREFECTS AND THE GOVERNORS THE COUNSELORS THE TREASURERS THE JUSTICES THE MAGISTRATES AND ALL THE OFFICIALS OF THE PROVINCES TO COME TO THE DEDICATION OF THE IMAGE THAT KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD SET UP

THEN THE SATRAPS THE PREFECTS AND THE GOVERNORS THE COUNSELORS THE TREASURERS THE JUSTICES THE MAGISTRATES AND ALL THE OFFICIALS OF THE PROVINCES GATHERED FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE IMAGE THAT KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD SET UP

AND THEY STOOD BEFORE THE IMAGE THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD SET UP

AND THE HERALD PROCLAIMED ALOUD YOU ARE COMMANDED O PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE HORN PIPE LYRE TRIGON HARP BAGPIPE AND EVERY KIND OF MUSIC YOU ARE TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE THAT KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAS SET UP

AND WHOEVER DOES NOT FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP SHALL IMMEDIATELY BE CAST INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE

 THEREFORE AS SOON AS ALL THE PEOPLES HEARD THE SOUND OF THE HORN PIPE LYRE TRIGON HARP BAGPIPE AND EVERY KIND OF MUSIC ALL THE PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPED THE GOLDEN IMAGE THAT KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD SET UP

THEREFORE AT THAT TIME CERTAIN CHALDEANS CAME FORWARD AND MALICIOUSLY ACCUSED THE JEWS

THEY DECLARED TO KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR O KING LIVE FOREVER

YOU O KING HAVE MADE A DECREE THAT EVERY MAN WHO HEARS THE SOUND OF THE HORN PIPE LYRE TRIGON HARP BAGPIPE AND EVERY KIND OF MUSIC SHALL FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE

AND WHOEVER DOES NOT FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP SHALL BE CAST INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE

THERE ARE CERTAIN JEWS WHOM YOU HAVE APPOINTED OVER THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO

THESE MEN O KING PAY NO ATTENTION TO YOU; THEY DO NOT SERVE YOUR GODS OR WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE THAT YOU HAVE SET UP

 THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR IN FURIOUS RAGE COMMANDED THAT SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO BE BROUGHT

SO THEY BROUGHT THESE MEN BEFORE THE KING

NEBUCHADNEZZAR ANSWERED AND SAID TO THEM IS IT TRUE O SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO THAT YOU DO NOT SERVE MY GODS OR WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE THAT I HAVE SET UP

NOW IF YOU ARE READY WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE HORN PIPE LYRE TRIGON HARP BAGPIPE AND EVERY KIND OF MUSIC TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE IMAGE THAT I HAVE MADE WELL AND GOOD

BUT IF YOU DO NOT WORSHIP YOU SHALL IMMEDIATELY BE CAST INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE

AND WHO IS THE GOD WHO WILL DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HANDS

 SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO ANSWERED AND SAID TO THE KING O NEBUCHADNEZZAR WE HAVE NO NEED TO ANSWER YOU IN THIS MATTER

IF THIS BE SO OUR GOD WHOM WE SERVE IS ABLE TO DELIVER US FROM THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE AND HE WILL DELIVER US OUT OF YOUR HAND O KING

BUT IF NOT BE IT KNOWN TO YOU O KING THAT WE WILL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS OR WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE THAT YOU HAVE SET UP

 THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS FILLED WITH FURY AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS CHANGED AGAINST SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO

HE ORDERED THE FURNACE HEATED SEVEN TIMES MORE THAN IT WAS USUALLY HEATED

AND HE ORDERED SOME OF THE MIGHTY MEN OF HIS ARMY TO BIND SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO AND TO CAST THEM INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE

THEN THESE MEN WERE BOUND IN THEIR CLOAKS THEIR TUNICS THEIR HATS AND THEIR OTHER GARMENTS AND THEY WERE THROWN INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE

BECAUSE THE KING'S ORDER WAS URGENT AND THE FURNACE OVERHEATED THE FLAME OF THE FIRE KILLED THOSE MEN WHO TOOK UP SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO

AND THESE THREE MEN SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO FELL BOUND INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE

THEN KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS ASTONISHED AND ROSE UP IN HASTE

HE DECLARED TO HIS COUNSELORS DID WE NOT CAST THREE MEN BOUND INTO THE FIRE

 THEY ANSWERED AND SAID TO THE KING TRUE O KING

 HE ANSWERED AND SAID BUT I SEE FOUR MEN UNBOUND WALKING IN THE MIDST OF THE FIRE AND THEY ARE NOT HURT; AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE FOURTH IS LIKE A SON OF THE GODS

 THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR CAME NEAR TO THE DOOR OF THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE; HE DECLARED SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO SERVANTS OF THE MOST HIGH GOD COME OUT AND COME HERE

 THEN SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO CAME OUT FROM THE FIRE

AND THE SATRAPS THE PREFECTS THE GOVERNORS AND THE KING'S COUNSELORS GATHERED TOGETHER AND SAW THAT THE FIRE HAD NOT HAD ANY POWER OVER THE BODIES OF THOSE MEN

THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS WAS NOT SINGED THEIR CLOAKS WERE NOT HARMED AND NO SMELL OF FIRE HAD COME UPON THEM

NEBUCHADNEZZAR ANSWERED AND SAID BLESSED BE THE GOD OF SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO WHO HAS SENT HIS ANGEL AND DELIVERED HIS SERVANTS WHO TRUSTED IN HIM AND SET ASIDE THE KING'S COMMAND AND YIELDED UP THEIR BODIES RATHER THAN SERVE AND WORSHIP ANY GOD EXCEPT THEIR OWN GOD

THEREFORE I MAKE A DECREE ANY PEOPLE NATION OR LANGUAGE THAT SPEAKS ANYTHING AGAINST THE GOD OF SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO SHALL BE TORN LIMB FROM LIMB AND THEIR HOUSES LAID IN RUINS FOR THERE IS NO OTHER GOD WHO IS ABLE TO RESCUE IN THIS WAY

 THEN THE KING PROMOTED SHADRACH MESHACH AND ABEDNEGO IN THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON

KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR TO ALL PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES THAT DWELL IN ALL THE EARTH PEACE BE MULTIPLIED TO YOU

IT HAS SEEMED GOOD TO ME TO SHOW THE SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT THE MOST HIGH GOD HAS DONE FOR ME

HOW GREAT ARE HIS SIGNS HOW MIGHTY HIS WONDERS

HIS KINGDOM IS AN EVERLASTING KINGDOM AND HIS DOMINION ENDURES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION

I NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS AT EASE IN MY HOUSE AND PROSPERING IN MY PALACE

I SAW A DREAM THAT MADE ME AFRAID

AS I LAY IN BED THE FANCIES AND THE VISIONS OF MY HEAD ALARMED ME

SO I MADE A DECREE THAT ALL THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE ME THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM

THEN THE MAGICIANS THE ENCHANTERS THE CHALDEANS AND THE ASTROLOGERS CAME IN AND I TOLD THEM THE DREAM BUT THEY COULD NOT MAKE KNOWN TO ME ITS INTERPRETATION

AT LAST DANIEL CAME IN BEFORE MEHE WHO WAS NAMED BELTESHAZZAR AFTER THE NAME OF MY GOD AND IN WHOM IS THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GODSAND I TOLD HIM THE DREAM SAYING O BELTESHAZZAR CHIEF OF THE MAGICIANS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GODS IS IN YOU AND THAT NO MYSTERY IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR YOU TELL ME THE VISIONS OF MY DREAM THAT I SAW AND THEIR INTERPRETATION

THE VISIONS OF MY HEAD AS I LAY IN BED WERE THESE I SAW AND BEHOLD A TREE IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH AND ITS HEIGHT WAS GREAT

THE TREE GREW AND BECAME STRONG AND ITS TOP REACHED TO HEAVEN AND IT WAS VISIBLE TO THE END OF THE WHOLE EARTH

ITS LEAVES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND ITS FRUIT ABUNDANT AND IN IT WAS FOOD FOR ALL

THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD FOUND SHADE UNDER IT AND THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS LIVED IN ITS BRANCHES AND ALL FLESH WAS FED FROM IT

I SAW IN THE VISIONS OF MY HEAD AS I LAY IN BED AND BEHOLD A WATCHER A HOLY ONE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN

HE PROCLAIMED ALOUD AND SAID THUS 'CHOP DOWN THE TREE AND LOP OFF ITS BRANCHES STRIP OFF ITS LEAVES AND SCATTER ITS FRUIT

LET THE BEASTS FLEE FROM UNDER IT AND THE BIRDS FROM ITS BRANCHES

BUT LEAVE THE STUMP OF ITS ROOTS IN THE EARTH BOUND WITH A BAND OF IRON AND BRONZE AMID THE TENDER GRASS OF THE FIELD

LET HIM BE WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN

LET HIS PORTION BE WITH THE BEASTS IN THE GRASS OF THE EARTH

LET HIS MIND BE CHANGED FROM A MAN'S AND LET A BEAST'S MIND BE GIVEN TO HIM; AND LET SEVEN PERIODS OF TIME PASS OVER HIM

THE SENTENCE IS BY THE DECREE OF THE WATCHERS THE DECISION BY THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONES TO THE END THAT THE LIVING MAY KNOW THAT THE MOST HIGH RULES THE KINGDOM OF MEN AND GIVES IT TO WHOM HE WILL AND SETS OVER IT THE LOWLIEST OF MEN

' THIS DREAM I KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAW

AND YOU O BELTESHAZZAR TELL ME THE INTERPRETATION BECAUSE ALL THE WISE MEN OF MY KINGDOM ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE INTERPRETATION BUT YOU ARE ABLE FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GODS IS IN YOU

 THEN DANIEL WHOSE NAME WAS BELTESHAZZAR WAS DISMAYED FOR A WHILE AND HIS THOUGHTS ALARMED HIM

THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID BELTESHAZZAR LET NOT THE DREAM OR THE INTERPRETATION ALARM YOU

 BELTESHAZZAR ANSWERED AND SAID MY LORD MAY THE DREAM BE FOR THOSE WHO HATE YOU AND ITS INTERPRETATION FOR YOUR ENEMIES

THE TREE YOU SAW WHICH GREW AND BECAME STRONG SO THAT ITS TOP REACHED TO HEAVEN AND IT WAS VISIBLE TO THE END OF THE WHOLE EARTH WHOSE LEAVES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND ITS FRUIT ABUNDANT AND IN WHICH WAS FOOD FOR ALL UNDER WHICH BEASTS OF THE FIELD FOUND SHADE AND IN WHOSE BRANCHES THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS LIVED IT IS YOU O KING WHO HAVE GROWN AND BECOME STRONG

YOUR GREATNESS HAS GROWN AND REACHES TO HEAVEN AND YOUR DOMINION TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

AND BECAUSE THE KING SAW A WATCHER A HOLY ONE COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND SAYING 'CHOP DOWN THE TREE AND DESTROY IT BUT LEAVE THE STUMP OF ITS ROOTS IN THE EARTH BOUND WITH A BAND OF IRON AND BRONZE IN THE TENDER GRASS OF THE FIELD AND LET HIM BE WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN AND LET HIS PORTION BE WITH THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD TILL SEVEN PERIODS OF TIME PASS OVER HIM' THIS IS THE INTERPRETATION O KING IT IS A DECREE OF THE MOST HIGH WHICH HAS COME UPON MY LORD THE KING THAT YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN FROM AMONG MEN AND YOUR DWELLING SHALL BE WITH THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD

YOU SHALL BE MADE TO EAT GRASS LIKE AN OX AND YOU SHALL BE WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN AND SEVEN PERIODS OF TIME SHALL PASS OVER YOU TILL YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST HIGH RULES THE KINGDOM OF MEN AND GIVES IT TO WHOM HE WILL

AND AS IT WAS COMMANDED TO LEAVE THE STUMP OF THE ROOTS OF THE TREE YOUR KINGDOM SHALL BE CONFIRMED FOR YOU FROM THE TIME THAT YOU KNOW THAT HEAVEN RULES

THEREFORE O KING LET MY COUNSEL BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU BREAK OFF YOUR SINS BY PRACTICING RIGHTEOUSNESS AND YOUR INIQUITIES BY SHOWING MERCY TO THE OPPRESSED THAT THERE MAY PERHAPS BE A LENGTHENING OF YOUR PROSPERITY

 ALL THIS CAME UPON KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR

AT THE END OF TWELVE MONTHS HE WAS WALKING ON THE ROOF OF THE ROYAL PALACE OF BABYLON AND THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID IS NOT THIS GREAT BABYLON WHICH I HAVE BUILT BY MY MIGHTY POWER AS A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND FOR THE GLORY OF MY MAJESTY

 WHILE THE WORDS WERE STILL IN THE KING'S MOUTH THERE FELL A VOICE FROM HEAVEN O KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR TO YOU IT IS SPOKEN THE KINGDOM HAS DEPARTED FROM YOU AND YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN FROM AMONG MEN AND YOUR DWELLING SHALL BE WITH THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD

AND YOU SHALL BE MADE TO EAT GRASS LIKE AN OX AND SEVEN PERIODS OF TIME SHALL PASS OVER YOU UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST HIGH RULES THE KINGDOM OF MEN AND GIVES IT TO WHOM HE WILL

 IMMEDIATELY THE WORD WAS FULFILLED AGAINST NEBUCHADNEZZAR

HE WAS DRIVEN FROM AMONG MEN AND ATE GRASS LIKE AN OX AND HIS BODY WAS WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN TILL HIS HAIR GREW AS LONG AS EAGLES' FEATHERS AND HIS NAILS WERE LIKE BIRDS' CLAWS

AT THE END OF THE DAYS I NEBUCHADNEZZAR LIFTED MY EYES TO HEAVEN AND MY REASON RETURNED TO ME AND I BLESSED THE MOST HIGH AND PRAISED AND HONORED HIM WHO LIVES FOREVER FOR HIS DOMINION IS AN EVERLASTING DOMINION AND HIS KINGDOM ENDURES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION; ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE ACCOUNTED AS NOTHING AND HE DOES ACCORDING TO HIS WILL AMONG THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH; AND NONE CAN STAY HIS HAND OR SAY TO HIM WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

 AT THE SAME TIME MY REASON RETURNED TO ME AND FOR THE GLORY OF MY KINGDOM MY MAJESTY AND SPLENDOR RETURNED TO ME

MY COUNSELORS AND MY LORDS SOUGHT ME AND I WAS ESTABLISHED IN MY KINGDOM AND STILL MORE GREATNESS WAS ADDED TO ME

NOW I NEBUCHADNEZZAR PRAISE AND EXTOL AND HONOR THE KING OF HEAVEN FOR ALL HIS WORKS ARE RIGHT AND HIS WAYS ARE JUST; AND THOSE WHO WALK IN PRIDE HE IS ABLE TO HUMBLE

KING BELSHAZZAR MADE A GREAT FEAST FOR A THOUSAND OF HIS LORDS AND DRANK WINE IN FRONT OF THE THOUSAND

BELSHAZZAR WHEN HE TASTED THE WINE COMMANDED THAT THE VESSELS OF GOLD AND OF SILVER THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN OUT OF THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM BE BROUGHT THAT THE KING AND HIS LORDS HIS WIVES AND HIS CONCUBINES MIGHT DRINK FROM THEM

THEN THEY BROUGHT IN THE GOLDEN VESSELS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE TEMPLE THE HOUSE OF GOD IN JERUSALEM AND THE KING AND HIS LORDS HIS WIVES AND HIS CONCUBINES DRANK FROM THEM

THEY DRANK WINE AND PRAISED THE GODS OF GOLD AND SILVER BRONZE IRON WOOD AND STONE

IMMEDIATELY THE FINGERS OF A HUMAN HAND APPEARED AND WROTE ON THE PLASTER OF THE WALL OF THE KING'S PALACE OPPOSITE THE LAMPSTAND

AND THE KING SAW THE HAND AS IT WROTE

THEN THE KING'S COLOR CHANGED AND HIS THOUGHTS ALARMED HIM; HIS LIMBS GAVE WAY AND HIS KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER

THE KING CALLED LOUDLY TO BRING IN THE ENCHANTERS THE CHALDEANS AND THE ASTROLOGERS

THE KING DECLARED TO THE WISE MEN OF BABYLON WHOEVER READS THIS WRITING AND SHOWS ME ITS INTERPRETATION SHALL BE CLOTHED WITH PURPLE AND HAVE A CHAIN OF GOLD AROUND HIS NECK AND SHALL BE THE THIRD RULER IN THE KINGDOM

 THEN ALL THE KING'S WISE MEN CAME IN BUT THEY COULD NOT READ THE WRITING OR MAKE KNOWN TO THE KING THE INTERPRETATION

THEN KING BELSHAZZAR WAS GREATLY ALARMED AND HIS COLOR CHANGED AND HIS LORDS WERE PERPLEXED

THE QUEEN BECAUSE OF THE WORDS OF THE KING AND HIS LORDS CAME INTO THE BANQUETING HALL AND THE QUEEN DECLARED O KING LIVE FOREVER

LET NOT YOUR THOUGHTS ALARM YOU OR YOUR COLOR CHANGE

THERE IS A MAN IN YOUR KINGDOM IN WHOM IS THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GODS

IN THE DAYS OF YOUR FATHER LIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING AND WISDOM LIKE THE WISDOM OF THE GODS WERE FOUND IN HIM AND KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR YOUR FATHERYOUR FATHER THE KINGMADE HIM CHIEF OF THE MAGICIANS ENCHANTERS CHALDEANS AND ASTROLOGERS BECAUSE AN EXCELLENT SPIRIT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING TO INTERPRET DREAMS EXPLAIN RIDDLES AND SOLVE PROBLEMS WERE FOUND IN THIS DANIEL WHOM THE KING NAMED BELTESHAZZAR

NOW LET DANIEL BE CALLED AND HE WILL SHOW THE INTERPRETATION

 THEN DANIEL WAS BROUGHT IN BEFORE THE KING

THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID TO DANIEL YOU ARE THAT DANIEL ONE OF THE EXILES OF JUDAH WHOM THE KING MY FATHER BROUGHT FROM JUDAH

I HAVE HEARD OF YOU THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE GODS IS IN YOU AND THAT LIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING AND EXCELLENT WISDOM ARE FOUND IN YOU

NOW THE WISE MEN THE ENCHANTERS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BEFORE ME TO READ THIS WRITING AND MAKE KNOWN TO ME ITS INTERPRETATION BUT THEY COULD NOT SHOW THE INTERPRETATION OF THE MATTER

BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU CAN GIVE INTERPRETATIONS AND SOLVE PROBLEMS

NOW IF YOU CAN READ THE WRITING AND MAKE KNOWN TO ME ITS INTERPRETATION YOU SHALL BE CLOTHED WITH PURPLE AND HAVE A CHAIN OF GOLD AROUND YOUR NECK AND SHALL BE THE THIRD RULER IN THE KINGDOM

 THEN DANIEL ANSWERED AND SAID BEFORE THE KING LET YOUR GIFTS BE FOR YOURSELF AND GIVE YOUR REWARDS TO ANOTHER

NEVERTHELESS I WILL READ THE WRITING TO THE KING AND MAKE KNOWN TO HIM THE INTERPRETATION

O KING THE MOST HIGH GOD GAVE NEBUCHADNEZZAR YOUR FATHER KINGSHIP AND GREATNESS AND GLORY AND MAJESTY

AND BECAUSE OF THE GREATNESS THAT HE GAVE HIM ALL PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES TREMBLED AND FEARED BEFORE HIM

WHOM HE WOULD HE KILLED AND WHOM HE WOULD HE KEPT ALIVE; WHOM HE WOULD HE RAISED UP AND WHOM HE WOULD HE HUMBLED

BUT WHEN HIS HEART WAS LIFTED UP AND HIS SPIRIT WAS HARDENED SO THAT HE DEALT PROUDLY HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN FROM HIS KINGLY THRONE AND HIS GLORY WAS TAKEN FROM HIM

HE WAS DRIVEN FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND AND HIS MIND WAS MADE LIKE THAT OF A BEAST AND HIS DWELLING WAS WITH THE WILD DONKEYS

HE WAS FED GRASS LIKE AN OX AND HIS BODY WAS WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN UNTIL HE KNEW THAT THE MOST HIGH GOD RULES THE KINGDOM OF MANKIND AND SETS OVER IT WHOM HE WILL

AND YOU HIS SON BELSHAZZAR HAVE NOT HUMBLED YOUR HEART THOUGH YOU KNEW ALL THIS BUT YOU HAVE LIFTED UP YOURSELF AGAINST THE LORD OF HEAVEN

AND THE VESSELS OF HIS HOUSE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN BEFORE YOU AND YOU AND YOUR LORDS YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CONCUBINES HAVE DRUNK WINE FROM THEM

AND YOU HAVE PRAISED THE GODS OF SILVER AND GOLD OF BRONZE IRON WOOD AND STONE WHICH DO NOT SEE OR HEAR OR KNOW BUT THE GOD IN WHOSE HAND IS YOUR BREATH AND WHOSE ARE ALL YOUR WAYS YOU HAVE NOT HONORED

THEN FROM HIS PRESENCE THE HAND WAS SENT AND THIS WRITING WAS INSCRIBED

AND THIS IS THE WRITING THAT WAS INSCRIBED MENE MENE TEKEL AND PARSIN

THIS IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE MATTER MENE GOD HAS NUMBERED THE DAYS OF YOUR KINGDOM AND BROUGHT IT TO AN END; TEKEL YOU HAVE BEEN WEIGHED IN THE BALANCES AND FOUND WANTING; PERES YOUR KINGDOM IS DIVIDED AND GIVEN TO THE MEDES AND PERSIANS

 THEN BELSHAZZAR GAVE THE COMMAND AND DANIEL WAS CLOTHED WITH PURPLE A CHAIN OF GOLD WAS PUT AROUND HIS NECK AND A PROCLAMATION WAS MADE ABOUT HIM THAT HE SHOULD BE THE THIRD RULER IN THE KINGDOM

THAT VERY NIGHT BELSHAZZAR THE CHALDEAN KING WAS KILLED

AND DARIUS THE MEDE RECEIVED THE KINGDOM BEING ABOUT SIXTYTWO YEARS OLD

IT PLEASED DARIUS TO SET OVER THE KINGDOM  SATRAPS TO BE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM; AND OVER THEM THREE PRESIDENTS OF WHOM DANIEL WAS ONE TO WHOM THESE SATRAPS SHOULD GIVE ACCOUNT SO THAT THE KING MIGHT SUFFER NO LOSS

THEN THIS DANIEL BECAME DISTINGUISHED ABOVE ALL THE OTHER PRESIDENTS AND SATRAPS BECAUSE AN EXCELLENT SPIRIT WAS IN HIM

AND THE KING PLANNED TO SET HIM OVER THE WHOLE KINGDOM

THEN THE PRESIDENTS AND THE SATRAPS SOUGHT TO FIND A GROUND FOR COMPLAINT AGAINST DANIEL WITH REGARD TO THE KINGDOM BUT THEY COULD FIND NO GROUND FOR COMPLAINT OR ANY FAULT BECAUSE HE WAS FAITHFUL AND NO ERROR OR FAULT WAS FOUND IN HIM

THEN THESE MEN SAID WE SHALL NOT FIND ANY GROUND FOR COMPLAINT AGAINST THIS DANIEL UNLESS WE FIND IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF HIS GOD

 THEN THESE PRESIDENTS AND SATRAPS CAME BY AGREEMENT TO THE KING AND SAID TO HIM O KING DARIUS LIVE FOREVER

ALL THE PRESIDENTS OF THE KINGDOM THE PREFECTS AND THE SATRAPS THE COUNSELORS AND THE GOVERNORS ARE AGREED THAT THE KING SHOULD ESTABLISH AN ORDINANCE AND ENFORCE AN INJUNCTION THAT WHOEVER MAKES PETITION TO ANY GOD OR MAN FOR THIRTY DAYS EXCEPT TO YOU O KING SHALL BE CAST INTO THE DEN OF LIONS

NOW O KING ESTABLISH THE INJUNCTION AND SIGN THE DOCUMENT SO THAT IT CANNOT BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE MEDES AND THE PERSIANS WHICH CANNOT BE REVOKED

 THEREFORE KING DARIUS SIGNED THE DOCUMENT AND INJUNCTION

WHEN DANIEL KNEW THAT THE DOCUMENT HAD BEEN SIGNED HE WENT TO HIS HOUSE WHERE HE HAD WINDOWS IN HIS UPPER CHAMBER OPEN TOWARD JERUSALEM

HE GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES THREE TIMES A DAY AND PRAYED AND GAVE THANKS BEFORE HIS GOD AS HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY

THEN THESE MEN CAME BY AGREEMENT AND FOUND DANIEL MAKING PETITION AND PLEA BEFORE HIS GOD

THEN THEY CAME NEAR AND SAID BEFORE THE KING CONCERNING THE INJUNCTION O KING

DID YOU NOT SIGN AN INJUNCTION THAT ANYONE WHO MAKES PETITION TO ANY GOD OR MAN WITHIN THIRTY DAYS EXCEPT TO YOU O KING SHALL BE CAST INTO THE DEN OF LIONS

 THE KING ANSWERED AND SAID THE THING STANDS FAST ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE MEDES AND PERSIANS WHICH CANNOT BE REVOKED

 THEN THEY ANSWERED AND SAID BEFORE THE KING DANIEL WHO IS ONE OF THE EXILES FROM JUDAH PAYS NO ATTENTION TO YOU O KING OR THE INJUNCTION YOU HAVE SIGNED BUT MAKES HIS PETITION THREE TIMES A DAY

 THEN THE KING WHEN HE HEARD THESE WORDS WAS MUCH DISTRESSED AND SET HIS MIND TO DELIVER DANIEL

AND HE LABORED TILL THE SUN WENT DOWN TO RESCUE HIM

THEN THESE MEN CAME BY AGREEMENT TO THE KING AND SAID TO THE KING KNOW O KING THAT IT IS A LAW OF THE MEDES AND PERSIANS THAT NO INJUNCTION OR ORDINANCE THAT THE KING ESTABLISHES CAN BE CHANGED

 THEN THE KING COMMANDED AND DANIEL WAS BROUGHT AND CAST INTO THE DEN OF LIONS

THE KING DECLARED TO DANIEL MAY YOUR GOD WHOM YOU SERVE CONTINUALLY DELIVER YOU

 AND A STONE WAS BROUGHT AND LAID ON THE MOUTH OF THE DEN AND THE KING SEALED IT WITH HIS OWN SIGNET AND WITH THE SIGNET OF HIS LORDS THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE CHANGED CONCERNING DANIEL

THEN THE KING WENT TO HIS PALACE AND SPENT THE NIGHT FASTING; NO DIVERSIONS WERE BROUGHT TO HIM AND SLEEP FLED FROM HIM

THEN AT BREAK OF DAY THE KING AROSE AND WENT IN HASTE TO THE DEN OF LIONS

AS HE CAME NEAR TO THE DEN WHERE DANIEL WAS HE CRIED OUT IN A TONE OF ANGUISH

THE KING DECLARED TO DANIEL O DANIEL SERVANT OF THE LIVING GOD HAS YOUR GOD WHOM YOU SERVE CONTINUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE LIONS

 THEN DANIEL SAID TO THE KING O KING LIVE FOREVER

MY GOD SENT HIS ANGEL AND SHUT THE LIONS' MOUTHS AND THEY HAVE NOT HARMED ME BECAUSE I WAS FOUND BLAMELESS BEFORE HIM; AND ALSO BEFORE YOU O KING I HAVE DONE NO HARM

 THEN THE KING WAS EXCEEDINGLY GLAD AND COMMANDED THAT DANIEL BE TAKEN UP OUT OF THE DEN

SO DANIEL WAS TAKEN UP OUT OF THE DEN AND NO KIND OF HARM WAS FOUND ON HIM BECAUSE HE HAD TRUSTED IN HIS GOD

AND THE KING COMMANDED AND THOSE MEN WHO HAD MALICIOUSLY ACCUSED DANIEL WERE BROUGHT AND CAST INTO THE DEN OF LIONSTHEY THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR WIVES

AND BEFORE THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE DEN THE LIONS OVERPOWERED THEM AND BROKE ALL THEIR BONES IN PIECES

THEN KING DARIUS WROTE TO ALL THE PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES THAT DWELL IN ALL THE EARTH PEACE BE MULTIPLIED TO YOU

I MAKE A DECREE THAT IN ALL MY ROYAL DOMINION PEOPLE ARE TO TREMBLE AND FEAR BEFORE THE GOD OF DANIEL FOR HE IS THE LIVING GOD ENDURING FOREVER; HIS KINGDOM SHALL NEVER BE DESTROYED AND HIS DOMINION SHALL BE TO THE END

HE DELIVERS AND RESCUES; HE WORKS SIGNS AND WONDERS IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH HE WHO HAS SAVED DANIEL FROM THE POWER OF THE LIONS

 SO THIS DANIEL PROSPERED DURING THE REIGN OF DARIUS AND THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE PERSIAN

IN THE FIRST YEAR OF BELSHAZZAR KING OF BABYLON DANIEL SAW A DREAM AND VISIONS OF HIS HEAD AS HE LAY IN HIS BED

THEN HE WROTE DOWN THE DREAM AND TOLD THE SUM OF THE MATTER

DANIEL DECLARED I SAW IN MY VISION BY NIGHT AND BEHOLD THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN WERE STIRRING UP THE GREAT SEA

AND FOUR GREAT BEASTS CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER

THE FIRST WAS LIKE A LION AND HAD EAGLES' WINGS

THEN AS I LOOKED ITS WINGS WERE PLUCKED OFF AND IT WAS LIFTED UP FROM THE GROUND AND MADE TO STAND ON TWO FEET LIKE A MAN AND THE MIND OF A MAN WAS GIVEN TO IT

AND BEHOLD ANOTHER BEAST A SECOND ONE LIKE A BEAR

IT WAS RAISED UP ON ONE SIDE

IT HAD THREE RIBS IN ITS MOUTH BETWEEN ITS TEETH; AND IT WAS TOLD 'ARISE DEVOUR MUCH FLESH

' AFTER THIS I LOOKED AND BEHOLD ANOTHER LIKE A LEOPARD WITH FOUR WINGS OF A BIRD ON ITS BACK

AND THE BEAST HAD FOUR HEADS AND DOMINION WAS GIVEN TO IT

AFTER THIS I SAW IN THE NIGHT VISIONS AND BEHOLD A FOURTH BEAST TERRIFYING AND DREADFUL AND EXCEEDINGLY STRONG

IT HAD GREAT IRON TEETH; IT DEVOURED AND BROKE IN PIECES AND STAMPED WHAT WAS LEFT WITH ITS FEET

IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE BEASTS THAT WERE BEFORE IT AND IT HAD TEN HORNS

I CONSIDERED THE HORNS AND BEHOLD THERE CAME UP AMONG THEM ANOTHER HORN A LITTLE ONE BEFORE WHICH THREE OF THE FIRST HORNS WERE PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS

AND BEHOLD IN THIS HORN WERE EYES LIKE THE EYES OF A MAN AND A MOUTH SPEAKING GREAT THINGS

AS I LOOKED THRONES WERE PLACED AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT; HIS CLOTHING WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD LIKE PURE WOOL; HIS THRONE WAS FIERY FLAMES; ITS WHEELS WERE BURNING FIRE

A STREAM OF FIRE ISSUED AND CAME OUT FROM BEFORE HIM; A THOUSAND THOUSANDS SERVED HIM AND TEN THOUSAND TIMES TEN THOUSAND STOOD BEFORE HIM; THE COURT SAT IN JUDGMENT AND THE BOOKS WERE OPENED

I LOOKED THEN BECAUSE OF THE SOUND OF THE GREAT WORDS THAT THE HORN WAS SPEAKING

AND AS I LOOKED THE BEAST WAS KILLED AND ITS BODY DESTROYED AND GIVEN OVER TO BE BURNED WITH FIRE

AS FOR THE REST OF THE BEASTS THEIR DOMINION WAS TAKEN AWAY BUT THEIR LIVES WERE PROLONGED FOR A SEASON AND A TIME

I SAW IN THE NIGHT VISIONS AND BEHOLD WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN THERE CAME ONE LIKE A SON OF MAN AND HE CAME TO THE ANCIENT OF DAYS AND WAS PRESENTED BEFORE HIM

AND TO HIM WAS GIVEN DOMINION AND GLORY AND A KINGDOM THAT ALL PEOPLES NATIONS AND LANGUAGES SHOULD SERVE HIM; HIS DOMINION IS AN EVERLASTING DOMINION WHICH SHALL NOT PASS AWAY AND HIS KINGDOM ONE THAT SHALL NOT BE DESTROYED

AS FOR ME DANIEL MY SPIRIT WITHIN ME WAS ANXIOUS AND THE VISIONS OF MY HEAD ALARMED ME

I APPROACHED ONE OF THOSE WHO STOOD THERE AND ASKED HIM THE TRUTH CONCERNING ALL THIS

SO HE TOLD ME AND MADE KNOWN TO ME THE INTERPRETATION OF THE THINGS

'THESE FOUR GREAT BEASTS ARE FOUR KINGS WHO SHALL ARISE OUT OF THE EARTH

BUT THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH SHALL RECEIVE THE KINGDOM AND POSSESS THE KINGDOM FOREVER FOREVER AND EVER

' THEN I DESIRED TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FOURTH BEAST WHICH WAS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE REST EXCEEDINGLY TERRIFYING WITH ITS TEETH OF IRON AND CLAWS OF BRONZE AND WHICH DEVOURED AND BROKE IN PIECES AND STAMPED WHAT WAS LEFT WITH ITS FEET AND ABOUT THE TEN HORNS THAT WERE ON ITS HEAD AND THE OTHER HORN THAT CAME UP AND BEFORE WHICH THREE OF THEM FELL THE HORN THAT HAD EYES AND A MOUTH THAT SPOKE GREAT THINGS AND THAT SEEMED GREATER THAN ITS COMPANIONS

AS I LOOKED THIS HORN MADE WAR WITH THE SAINTS AND PREVAILED OVER THEM UNTIL THE ANCIENT OF DAYS CAME AND JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN FOR THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH AND THE TIME CAME WHEN THE SAINTS POSSESSED THE KINGDOM

THUS HE SAID 'AS FOR THE FOURTH BEAST THERE SHALL BE A FOURTH KINGDOM ON EARTH WHICH SHALL BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE KINGDOMS AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE WHOLE EARTH AND TRAMPLE IT DOWN AND BREAK IT TO PIECES

AS FOR THE TEN HORNS OUT OF THIS KINGDOM TEN KINGS SHALL ARISE AND ANOTHER SHALL ARISE AFTER THEM; HE SHALL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER ONES AND SHALL PUT DOWN THREE KINGS

HE SHALL SPEAK WORDS AGAINST THE MOST HIGH AND SHALL WEAR OUT THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH AND SHALL THINK TO CHANGE THE TIMES AND THE LAW; AND THEY SHALL BE GIVEN INTO HIS HAND FOR A TIME TIMES AND HALF A TIME

BUT THE COURT SHALL SIT IN JUDGMENT AND HIS DOMINION SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY TO BE CONSUMED AND DESTROYED TO THE END

AND THE KINGDOM AND THE DOMINION AND THE GREATNESS OF THE KINGDOMS UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH; THEIR KINGDOM SHALL BE AN EVERLASTING KINGDOM AND ALL DOMINIONS SHALL SERVE AND OBEY THEM

' HERE IS THE END OF THE MATTER

AS FOR ME DANIEL MY THOUGHTS GREATLY ALARMED ME AND MY COLOR CHANGED BUT I KEPT THE MATTER IN MY HEART

IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING BELSHAZZAR A VISION APPEARED TO ME DANIEL AFTER THAT WHICH APPEARED TO ME AT THE FIRST

AND I SAW IN THE VISION; AND WHEN I SAW I WAS IN SUSA THE CAPITAL WHICH IS IN THE PROVINCE OF ELAM

AND I SAW IN THE VISION AND I WAS AT THE ULAI CANAL

I RAISED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD A RAM STANDING ON THE BANK OF THE CANAL

IT HAD TWO HORNS AND BOTH HORNS WERE HIGH BUT ONE WAS HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND THE HIGHER ONE CAME UP LAST

I SAW THE RAM CHARGING WESTWARD AND NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD

NO BEAST COULD STAND BEFORE HIM AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD RESCUE FROM HIS POWER

HE DID AS HE PLEASED AND BECAME GREAT

AS I WAS CONSIDERING BEHOLD A MALE GOAT CAME FROM THE WEST ACROSS THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GROUND

AND THE GOAT HAD A CONSPICUOUS HORN BETWEEN HIS EYES

HE CAME TO THE RAM WITH THE TWO HORNS WHICH I HAD SEEN STANDING ON THE BANK OF THE CANAL AND HE RAN AT HIM IN HIS POWERFUL WRATH

I SAW HIM COME CLOSE TO THE RAM AND HE WAS ENRAGED AGAINST HIM AND STRUCK THE RAM AND BROKE HIS TWO HORNS

AND THE RAM HAD NO POWER TO STAND BEFORE HIM BUT HE CAST HIM DOWN TO THE GROUND AND TRAMPLED ON HIM

AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD RESCUE THE RAM FROM HIS POWER

THEN THE GOAT BECAME EXCEEDINGLY GREAT BUT WHEN HE WAS STRONG THE GREAT HORN WAS BROKEN AND INSTEAD OF IT THERE CAME UP FOUR CONSPICUOUS HORNS TOWARD THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN

OUT OF ONE OF THEM CAME A LITTLE HORN WHICH GREW EXCEEDINGLY GREAT TOWARD THE SOUTH TOWARD THE EAST AND TOWARD THE GLORIOUS LAND

IT GREW GREAT EVEN TO THE HOST OF HEAVEN

AND SOME OF THE HOST AND SOME OF THE STARS IT THREW DOWN TO THE GROUND AND TRAMPLED ON THEM

IT BECAME GREAT EVEN AS GREAT AS THE PRINCE OF THE HOST

AND THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND THE PLACE OF HIS SANCTUARY WAS OVERTHROWN

AND A HOST WILL BE GIVEN OVER TO IT TOGETHER WITH THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSION AND IT WILL THROW TRUTH TO THE GROUND AND IT WILL ACT AND PROSPER

THEN I HEARD A HOLY ONE SPEAKING AND ANOTHER HOLY ONE SAID TO THE ONE WHO SPOKE FOR HOW LONG IS THE VISION CONCERNING THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING THE TRANSGRESSION THAT MAKES DESOLATE AND THE GIVING OVER OF THE SANCTUARY AND HOST TO BE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT

 AND HE SAID TO ME FOR  EVENINGS AND MORNINGS

THEN THE SANCTUARY SHALL BE RESTORED TO ITS RIGHTFUL STATE

 WHEN I DANIEL HAD SEEN THE VISION I SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND IT

AND BEHOLD THERE STOOD BEFORE ME ONE HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN

AND I HEARD A MAN'S VOICE BETWEEN THE BANKS OF THE ULAI AND IT CALLED GABRIEL MAKE THIS MAN UNDERSTAND THE VISION

 SO HE CAME NEAR WHERE I STOOD

AND WHEN HE CAME I WAS FRIGHTENED AND FELL ON MY FACE

BUT HE SAID TO ME UNDERSTAND O SON OF MAN THAT THE VISION IS FOR THE TIME OF THE END

 AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME I FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP WITH MY FACE TO THE GROUND

BUT HE TOUCHED ME AND MADE ME STAND UP

HE SAID BEHOLD I WILL MAKE KNOWN TO YOU WHAT SHALL BE AT THE LATTER END OF THE INDIGNATION FOR IT REFERS TO THE APPOINTED TIME OF THE END

AS FOR THE RAM THAT YOU SAW WITH THE TWO HORNS THESE ARE THE KINGS OF MEDIA AND PERSIA

AND THE GOAT IS THE KING OF GREECE

AND THE GREAT HORN BETWEEN HIS EYES IS THE FIRST KING

AS FOR THE HORN THAT WAS BROKEN IN PLACE OF WHICH FOUR OTHERS AROSE FOUR KINGDOMS SHALL ARISE FROM HIS NATION BUT NOT WITH HIS POWER

AND AT THE LATTER END OF THEIR KINGDOM WHEN THE TRANSGRESSORS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMIT A KING OF BOLD FACE ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS RIDDLES SHALL ARISE

HIS POWER SHALL BE GREATBUT NOT BY HIS OWN POWER; AND HE SHALL CAUSE FEARFUL DESTRUCTION AND SHALL SUCCEED IN WHAT HE DOES AND DESTROY MIGHTY MEN AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE SAINTS

BY HIS CUNNING HE SHALL MAKE DECEIT PROSPER UNDER HIS HAND AND IN HIS OWN MIND HE SHALL BECOME GREAT

WITHOUT WARNING HE SHALL DESTROY MANY

AND HE SHALL EVEN RISE UP AGAINST THE PRINCE OF PRINCES AND HE SHALL BE BROKENBUT BY NO HUMAN HAND

THE VISION OF THE EVENINGS AND THE MORNINGS THAT HAS BEEN TOLD IS TRUE BUT SEAL UP THE VISION FOR IT REFERS TO MANY DAYS FROM NOW

 AND I DANIEL WAS OVERCOME AND LAY SICK FOR SOME DAYS

THEN I ROSE AND WENT ABOUT THE KING'S BUSINESS BUT I WAS APPALLED BY THE VISION AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT

IN THE FIRST YEAR OF DARIUS THE SON OF AHASUERUS BY DESCENT A MEDE WHO WAS MADE KING OVER THE REALM OF THE CHALDEANS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN I DANIEL PERCEIVED IN THE BOOKS THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET MUST PASS BEFORE THE END OF THE DESOLATIONS OF JERUSALEM NAMELY SEVENTY YEARS

THEN I TURNED MY FACE TO THE LORD GOD SEEKING HIM BY PRAYER AND PLEAS FOR MERCY WITH FASTING AND SACKCLOTH AND ASHES

I PRAYED TO THE LORD MY GOD AND MADE CONFESSION SAYING O LORD THE GREAT AND AWESOME GOD WHO KEEPS COVENANT AND STEADFAST LOVE WITH THOSE WHO LOVE HIM AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS WE HAVE SINNED AND DONE WRONG AND ACTED WICKEDLY AND REBELLED TURNING ASIDE FROM YOUR COMMANDMENTS AND RULES

WE HAVE NOT LISTENED TO YOUR SERVANTS THE PROPHETS WHO SPOKE IN YOUR NAME TO OUR KINGS OUR PRINCES AND OUR FATHERS AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

TO YOU O LORD BELONGS RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT TO US OPEN SHAME AS AT THIS DAY TO THE MEN OF JUDAH TO THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND TO ALL ISRAEL THOSE WHO ARE NEAR AND THOSE WHO ARE FAR AWAY IN ALL THE LANDS TO WHICH YOU HAVE DRIVEN THEM BECAUSE OF THE TREACHERY THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST YOU

TO US O LORD BELONGS OPEN SHAME TO OUR KINGS TO OUR PRINCES AND TO OUR FATHERS BECAUSE WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

TO THE LORD OUR GOD BELONG MERCY AND FORGIVENESS FOR WE HAVE REBELLED AGAINST HIM AND HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD BY WALKING IN HIS LAWS WHICH HE SET BEFORE US BY HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

ALL ISRAEL HAS TRANSGRESSED YOUR LAW AND TURNED ASIDE REFUSING TO OBEY YOUR VOICE

AND THE CURSE AND OATH THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES THE SERVANT OF GOD HAVE BEEN POURED OUT UPON US BECAUSE WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST HIM

HE HAS CONFIRMED HIS WORDS WHICH HE SPOKE AGAINST US AND AGAINST OUR RULERS WHO RULED US BY BRINGING UPON US A GREAT CALAMITY

FOR UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN THERE HAS NOT BEEN DONE ANYTHING LIKE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE AGAINST JERUSALEM

AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES ALL THIS CALAMITY HAS COME UPON US; YET WE HAVE NOT ENTREATED THE FAVOR OF THE LORD OUR GOD TURNING FROM OUR INIQUITIES AND GAINING INSIGHT BY YOUR TRUTH

THEREFORE THE LORD HAS KEPT READY THE CALAMITY AND HAS BROUGHT IT UPON US FOR THE LORD OUR GOD IS RIGHTEOUS IN ALL THE WORKS THAT HE HAS DONE AND WE HAVE NOT OBEYED HIS VOICE

AND NOW O LORD OUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOUR PEOPLE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND HAVE MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF AS AT THIS DAY WE HAVE SINNED WE HAVE DONE WICKEDLY

O LORD ACCORDING TO ALL YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS LET YOUR ANGER AND YOUR WRATH TURN AWAY FROM YOUR CITY JERUSALEM YOUR HOLY HILL BECAUSE FOR OUR SINS AND FOR THE INIQUITIES OF OUR FATHERS JERUSALEM AND YOUR PEOPLE HAVE BECOME A BYWORD AMONG ALL WHO ARE AROUND US

NOW THEREFORE O OUR GOD LISTEN TO THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANT AND TO HIS PLEAS FOR MERCY AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE O LORD MAKE YOUR FACE TO SHINE UPON YOUR SANCTUARY WHICH IS DESOLATE

O MY GOD INCLINE YOUR EAR AND HEAR

OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE OUR DESOLATIONS AND THE CITY THAT IS CALLED BY YOUR NAME

FOR WE DO NOT PRESENT OUR PLEAS BEFORE YOU BECAUSE OF OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR GREAT MERCY

O LORD HEAR; O LORD FORGIVE

O LORD PAY ATTENTION AND ACT

DELAY NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE O MY GOD BECAUSE YOUR CITY AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE CALLED BY YOUR NAME

 WHILE I WAS SPEAKING AND PRAYING CONFESSING MY SIN AND THE SIN OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND PRESENTING MY PLEA BEFORE THE LORD MY GOD FOR THE HOLY HILL OF MY GOD WHILE I WAS SPEAKING IN PRAYER THE MAN GABRIEL WHOM I HAD SEEN IN THE VISION AT THE FIRST CAME TO ME IN SWIFT FLIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE EVENING SACRIFICE

HE MADE ME UNDERSTAND SPEAKING WITH ME AND SAYING O DANIEL I HAVE NOW COME OUT TO GIVE YOU INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING

AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PLEAS FOR MERCY A WORD WENT OUT AND I HAVE COME TO TELL IT TO YOU FOR YOU ARE GREATLY LOVED

THEREFORE CONSIDER THE WORD AND UNDERSTAND THE VISION

SEVENTY WEEKS ARE DECREED ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HOLY CITY TO FINISH THE TRANSGRESSION TO PUT AN END TO SIN AND TO ATONE FOR INIQUITY TO BRING IN EVERLASTING RIGHTEOUSNESS TO SEAL BOTH VISION AND PROPHET AND TO ANOINT A MOST HOLY PLACE

KNOW THEREFORE AND UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE GOING OUT OF THE WORD TO RESTORE AND BUILD JERUSALEM TO THE COMING OF AN ANOINTED ONE A PRINCE THERE SHALL BE SEVEN WEEKS

THEN FOR SIXTYTWO WEEKS IT SHALL BE BUILT AGAIN WITH SQUARES AND MOAT BUT IN A TROUBLED TIME

AND AFTER THE SIXTYTWO WEEKS AN ANOINTED ONE SHALL BE CUT OFF AND SHALL HAVE NOTHING

AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PRINCE WHO IS TO COME SHALL DESTROY THE CITY AND THE SANCTUARY

ITS END SHALL COME WITH A FLOOD AND TO THE END THERE SHALL BE WAR

DESOLATIONS ARE DECREED

AND HE SHALL MAKE A STRONG COVENANT WITH MANY FOR ONE WEEK AND FOR HALF OF THE WEEK HE SHALL PUT AN END TO SACRIFICE AND OFFERING

AND ON THE WING OF ABOMINATIONS SHALL COME ONE WHO MAKES DESOLATE UNTIL THE DECREED END IS POURED OUT ON THE DESOLATOR

IN THE THIRD YEAR OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA A WORD WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL WHO WAS NAMED BELTESHAZZAR

AND THE WORD WAS TRUE AND IT WAS A GREAT CONFLICT

AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD AND HAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE VISION

IN THOSE DAYS I DANIEL WAS MOURNING FOR THREE WEEKS

I ATE NO DELICACIES NO MEAT OR WINE ENTERED MY MOUTH NOR DID I ANOINT MYSELF AT ALL FOR THE FULL THREE WEEKS

ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH AS I WAS STANDING ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER THAT IS THE TIGRIS I LIFTED UP MY EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD A MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WITH A BELT OF FINE GOLD FROM UPHAZ AROUND HIS WAIST

HIS BODY WAS LIKE BERYL HIS FACE LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF LIGHTNING HIS EYES LIKE FLAMING TORCHES HIS ARMS AND LEGS LIKE THE GLEAM OF BURNISHED BRONZE AND THE SOUND OF HIS WORDS LIKE THE SOUND OF A MULTITUDE

AND I DANIEL ALONE SAW THE VISION FOR THE MEN WHO WERE WITH ME DID NOT SEE THE VISION BUT A GREAT TREMBLING FELL UPON THEM AND THEY FLED TO HIDE THEMSELVES

SO I WAS LEFT ALONE AND SAW THIS GREAT VISION AND NO STRENGTH WAS LEFT IN ME

MY RADIANT APPEARANCE WAS FEARFULLY CHANGED AND I RETAINED NO STRENGTH

THEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS WORDS AND AS I HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS WORDS I FELL ON MY FACE IN DEEP SLEEP WITH MY FACE TO THE GROUND

AND BEHOLD A HAND TOUCHED ME AND SET ME TREMBLING ON MY HANDS AND KNEES

AND HE SAID TO ME O DANIEL MAN GREATLY LOVED UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK TO YOU AND STAND UPRIGHT FOR NOW I HAVE BEEN SENT TO YOU

 AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THIS WORD TO ME I STOOD UP TREMBLING

THEN HE SAID TO ME FEAR NOT DANIEL FOR FROM THE FIRST DAY THAT YOU SET YOUR HEART TO UNDERSTAND AND HUMBLED YOURSELF BEFORE YOUR GOD YOUR WORDS HAVE BEEN HEARD AND I HAVE COME BECAUSE OF YOUR WORDS

THE PRINCE OF THE KINGDOM OF PERSIA WITHSTOOD ME TWENTYONE DAYS BUT MICHAEL ONE OF THE CHIEF PRINCES CAME TO HELP ME FOR I WAS LEFT THERE WITH THE KINGS OF PERSIA AND CAME TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS TO HAPPEN TO YOUR PEOPLE IN THE LATTER DAYS

FOR THE VISION IS FOR DAYS YET TO COME

 WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME ACCORDING TO THESE WORDS I TURNED MY FACE TOWARD THE GROUND AND WAS MUTE

AND BEHOLD ONE IN THE LIKENESS OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN TOUCHED MY LIPS

THEN I OPENED MY MOUTH AND SPOKE

I SAID TO HIM WHO STOOD BEFORE ME O MY LORD BY REASON OF THE VISION PAINS HAVE COME UPON ME AND I RETAIN NO STRENGTH

HOW CAN MY LORD'S SERVANT TALK WITH MY LORD

FOR NOW NO STRENGTH REMAINS IN ME AND NO BREATH IS LEFT IN ME

 AGAIN ONE HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN TOUCHED ME AND STRENGTHENED ME

AND HE SAID O MAN GREATLY LOVED FEAR NOT PEACE BE WITH YOU; BE STRONG AND OF GOOD COURAGE

 AND AS HE SPOKE TO ME I WAS STRENGTHENED AND SAID LET MY LORD SPEAK FOR YOU HAVE STRENGTHENED ME

 THEN HE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHY I HAVE COME TO YOU

BUT NOW I WILL RETURN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE PRINCE OF PERSIA; AND WHEN I GO OUT BEHOLD THE PRINCE OF GREECE WILL COME

BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE BOOK OF TRUTH THERE IS NONE WHO CONTENDS BY MY SIDE AGAINST THESE EXCEPT MICHAEL YOUR PRINCE

AND AS FOR ME IN THE FIRST YEAR OF DARIUS THE MEDE I STOOD UP TO CONFIRM AND STRENGTHEN HIM

AND NOW I WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUTH

BEHOLD THREE MORE KINGS SHALL ARISE IN PERSIA AND A FOURTH SHALL BE FAR RICHER THAN ALL OF THEM

AND WHEN HE HAS BECOME STRONG THROUGH HIS RICHES HE SHALL STIR UP ALL AGAINST THE KINGDOM OF GREECE

THEN A MIGHTY KING SHALL ARISE WHO SHALL RULE WITH GREAT DOMINION AND DO AS HE WILLS

AND AS SOON AS HE HAS ARISEN HIS KINGDOM SHALL BE BROKEN AND DIVIDED TOWARD THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN BUT NOT TO HIS POSTERITY NOR ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITY WITH WHICH HE RULED FOR HIS KINGDOM SHALL BE PLUCKED UP AND GO TO OTHERS BESIDES THESE

THEN THE KING OF THE SOUTH SHALL BE STRONG BUT ONE OF HIS PRINCES SHALL BE STRONGER THAN HE AND SHALL RULE AND HIS AUTHORITY SHALL BE A GREAT AUTHORITY

AFTER SOME YEARS THEY SHALL MAKE AN ALLIANCE AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE SOUTH SHALL COME TO THE KING OF THE NORTH TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT

BUT SHE SHALL NOT RETAIN THE STRENGTH OF HER ARM AND HE AND HIS ARM SHALL NOT ENDURE BUT SHE SHALL BE GIVEN UP AND HER ATTENDANTS HE WHO FATHERED HER AND HE WHO SUPPORTED HER IN THOSE TIMES

AND FROM A BRANCH FROM HER ROOTS ONE SHALL ARISE IN HIS PLACE

HE SHALL COME AGAINST THE ARMY AND ENTER THE FORTRESS OF THE KING OF THE NORTH AND HE SHALL DEAL WITH THEM AND SHALL PREVAIL

HE SHALL ALSO CARRY OFF TO EGYPT THEIR GODS WITH THEIR METAL IMAGES AND THEIR PRECIOUS VESSELS OF SILVER AND GOLD AND FOR SOME YEARS HE SHALL REFRAIN FROM ATTACKING THE KING OF THE NORTH

THEN THE LATTER SHALL COME INTO THE REALM OF THE KING OF THE SOUTH BUT SHALL RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND

HIS SONS SHALL WAGE WAR AND ASSEMBLE A MULTITUDE OF GREAT FORCES WHICH SHALL KEEP COMING AND OVERFLOW AND PASS THROUGH AND AGAIN SHALL CARRY THE WAR AS FAR AS HIS FORTRESS

THEN THE KING OF THE SOUTH MOVED WITH RAGE SHALL COME OUT AND FIGHT WITH THE KING OF THE NORTH

AND HE SHALL RAISE A GREAT MULTITUDE BUT IT SHALL BE GIVEN INTO HIS HAND

AND WHEN THE MULTITUDE IS TAKEN AWAY HIS HEART SHALL BE EXALTED AND HE SHALL CAST DOWN TENS OF THOUSANDS BUT HE SHALL NOT PREVAIL

FOR THE KING OF THE NORTH SHALL AGAIN RAISE A MULTITUDE GREATER THAN THE FIRST

AND AFTER SOME YEARS HE SHALL COME ON WITH A GREAT ARMY AND ABUNDANT SUPPLIES

IN THOSE TIMES MANY SHALL RISE AGAINST THE KING OF THE SOUTH AND THE VIOLENT AMONG YOUR OWN PEOPLE SHALL LIFT THEMSELVES UP IN ORDER TO FULFILL THE VISION BUT THEY SHALL FAIL

THEN THE KING OF THE NORTH SHALL COME AND THROW UP SIEGEWORKS AND TAKE A WELLFORTIFIED CITY

AND THE FORCES OF THE SOUTH SHALL NOT STAND OR EVEN HIS BEST TROOPS FOR THERE SHALL BE NO STRENGTH TO STAND

BUT HE WHO COMES AGAINST HIM SHALL DO AS HE WILLS AND NONE SHALL STAND BEFORE HIM

AND HE SHALL STAND IN THE GLORIOUS LAND WITH DESTRUCTION IN HIS HAND

HE SHALL SET HIS FACE TO COME WITH THE STRENGTH OF HIS WHOLE KINGDOM AND HE SHALL BRING TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT AND PERFORM THEM

HE SHALL GIVE HIM THE DAUGHTER OF WOMEN TO DESTROY THE KINGDOM BUT IT SHALL NOT STAND OR BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE

AFTERWARD HE SHALL TURN HIS FACE TO THE COASTLANDS AND SHALL CAPTURE MANY OF THEM BUT A COMMANDER SHALL PUT AN END TO HIS INSOLENCE

INDEED HE SHALL TURN HIS INSOLENCE BACK UPON HIM

THEN HE SHALL TURN HIS FACE BACK TOWARD THE FORTRESSES OF HIS OWN LAND BUT HE SHALL STUMBLE AND FALL AND SHALL NOT BE FOUND

THEN SHALL ARISE IN HIS PLACE ONE WHO SHALL SEND AN EXACTOR OF TRIBUTE FOR THE GLORY OF THE KINGDOM

BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS HE SHALL BE BROKEN NEITHER IN ANGER NOR IN BATTLE

IN HIS PLACE SHALL ARISE A CONTEMPTIBLE PERSON TO WHOM ROYAL MAJESTY HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN

HE SHALL COME IN WITHOUT WARNING AND OBTAIN THE KINGDOM BY FLATTERIES

ARMIES SHALL BE UTTERLY SWEPT AWAY BEFORE HIM AND BROKEN EVEN THE PRINCE OF THE COVENANT

AND FROM THE TIME THAT AN ALLIANCE IS MADE WITH HIM HE SHALL ACT DECEITFULLY AND HE SHALL BECOME STRONG WITH A SMALL PEOPLE

WITHOUT WARNING HE SHALL COME INTO THE RICHEST PARTS OF THE PROVINCE AND HE SHALL DO WHAT NEITHER HIS FATHERS NOR HIS FATHERS' FATHERS HAVE DONE SCATTERING AMONG THEM PLUNDER SPOIL AND GOODS

HE SHALL DEVISE PLANS AGAINST STRONGHOLDS BUT ONLY FOR A TIME

AND HE SHALL STIR UP HIS POWER AND HIS HEART AGAINST THE KING OF THE SOUTH WITH A GREAT ARMY

AND THE KING OF THE SOUTH SHALL WAGE WAR WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT AND MIGHTY ARMY BUT HE SHALL NOT STAND FOR PLOTS SHALL BE DEVISED AGAINST HIM

EVEN THOSE WHO EAT HIS FOOD SHALL BREAK HIM

HIS ARMY SHALL BE SWEPT AWAY AND MANY SHALL FALL DOWN SLAIN

AND AS FOR THE TWO KINGS THEIR HEARTS SHALL BE BENT ON DOING EVIL

THEY SHALL SPEAK LIES AT THE SAME TABLE BUT TO NO AVAIL FOR THE END IS YET TO BE AT THE TIME APPOINTED

AND HE SHALL RETURN TO HIS LAND WITH GREAT WEALTH BUT HIS HEART SHALL BE SET AGAINST THE HOLY COVENANT

AND HE SHALL WORK HIS WILL AND RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND

AT THE TIME APPOINTED HE SHALL RETURN AND COME INTO THE SOUTH BUT IT SHALL NOT BE THIS TIME AS IT WAS BEFORE

FOR SHIPS OF KITTIM SHALL COME AGAINST HIM AND HE SHALL BE AFRAID AND WITHDRAW AND SHALL TURN BACK AND BE ENRAGED AND TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE HOLY COVENANT

HE SHALL TURN BACK AND PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO FORSAKE THE HOLY COVENANT

FORCES FROM HIM SHALL APPEAR AND PROFANE THE TEMPLE AND FORTRESS AND SHALL TAKE AWAY THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING

AND THEY SHALL SET UP THE ABOMINATION THAT MAKES DESOLATE

HE SHALL SEDUCE WITH FLATTERY THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE COVENANT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL STAND FIRM AND TAKE ACTION

AND THE WISE AMONG THE PEOPLE SHALL MAKE MANY UNDERSTAND THOUGH FOR SOME DAYS THEY SHALL STUMBLE BY SWORD AND FLAME BY CAPTIVITY AND PLUNDER

WHEN THEY STUMBLE THEY SHALL RECEIVE A LITTLE HELP

AND MANY SHALL JOIN THEMSELVES TO THEM WITH FLATTERY AND SOME OF THE WISE SHALL STUMBLE SO THAT THEY MAY BE REFINED PURIFIED AND MADE WHITE UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END FOR IT STILL AWAITS THE APPOINTED TIME

AND THE KING SHALL DO AS HE WILLS

HE SHALL EXALT HIMSELF AND MAGNIFY HIMSELF ABOVE EVERY GOD AND SHALL SPEAK ASTONISHING THINGS AGAINST THE GOD OF GODS

HE SHALL PROSPER TILL THE INDIGNATION IS ACCOMPLISHED; FOR WHAT IS DECREED SHALL BE DONE

HE SHALL PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE GODS OF HIS FATHERS OR TO THE ONE BELOVED BY WOMEN

HE SHALL NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY OTHER GOD FOR HE SHALL MAGNIFY HIMSELF ABOVE ALL

HE SHALL HONOR THE GOD OF FORTRESSES INSTEAD OF THESE

A GOD WHOM HIS FATHERS DID NOT KNOW HE SHALL HONOR WITH GOLD AND SILVER WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND COSTLY GIFTS

HE SHALL DEAL WITH THE STRONGEST FORTRESSES WITH THE HELP OF A FOREIGN GOD

THOSE WHO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HE SHALL LOAD WITH HONOR

HE SHALL MAKE THEM RULERS OVER MANY AND SHALL DIVIDE THE LAND FOR A PRICE

AT THE TIME OF THE END THE KING OF THE SOUTH SHALL ATTACK HIM BUT THE KING OF THE NORTH SHALL RUSH UPON HIM LIKE A WHIRLWIND WITH CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND WITH MANY SHIPS

AND HE SHALL COME INTO COUNTRIES AND SHALL OVERFLOW AND PASS THROUGH

HE SHALL COME INTO THE GLORIOUS LAND

AND TENS OF THOUSANDS SHALL FALL BUT THESE SHALL BE DELIVERED OUT OF HIS HAND EDOM AND MOAB AND THE MAIN PART OF THE AMMONITES

HE SHALL STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE COUNTRIES AND THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL NOT ESCAPE

HE SHALL BECOME RULER OF THE TREASURES OF GOLD AND OF SILVER AND ALL THE PRECIOUS THINGS OF EGYPT AND THE LIBYANS AND THE CUSHITES SHALL FOLLOW IN HIS TRAIN

BUT NEWS FROM THE EAST AND THE NORTH SHALL ALARM HIM AND HE SHALL GO OUT WITH GREAT FURY TO DESTROY AND DEVOTE MANY TO DESTRUCTION

AND HE SHALL PITCH HIS PALATIAL TENTS BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE GLORIOUS HOLY MOUNTAIN

YET HE SHALL COME TO HIS END WITH NONE TO HELP HIM

AT THAT TIME SHALL ARISE MICHAEL THE GREAT PRINCE WHO HAS CHARGE OF YOUR PEOPLE

AND THERE SHALL BE A TIME OF TROUBLE SUCH AS NEVER HAS BEEN SINCE THERE WAS A NATION TILL THAT TIME

BUT AT THAT TIME YOUR PEOPLE SHALL BE DELIVERED EVERYONE WHOSE NAME SHALL BE FOUND WRITTEN IN THE BOOK

AND MANY OF THOSE WHO SLEEP IN THE DUST OF THE EARTH SHALL AWAKE SOME TO EVERLASTING LIFE AND SOME TO SHAME AND EVERLASTING CONTEMPT

AND THOSE WHO ARE WISE SHALL SHINE LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SKY ABOVE; AND THOSE WHO TURN MANY TO RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE THE STARS FOREVER AND EVER

BUT YOU DANIEL SHUT UP THE WORDS AND SEAL THE BOOK UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END

MANY SHALL RUN TO AND FRO AND KNOWLEDGE SHALL INCREASE

 THEN I DANIEL LOOKED AND BEHOLD TWO OTHERS STOOD ONE ON THIS BANK OF THE STREAM AND ONE ON THAT BANK OF THE STREAM

AND SOMEONE SAID TO THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WHO WAS ABOVE THE WATERS OF THE STREAM HOW LONG SHALL IT BE TILL THE END OF THESE WONDERS

 AND I HEARD THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WHO WAS ABOVE THE WATERS OF THE STREAM; HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT HAND TOWARD HEAVEN AND SWORE BY HIM WHO LIVES FOREVER THAT IT WOULD BE FOR A TIME TIMES AND HALF A TIME AND THAT WHEN THE SHATTERING OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY PEOPLE COMES TO AN END ALL THESE THINGS WOULD BE FINISHED

I HEARD BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND

THEN I SAID O MY LORD WHAT SHALL BE THE OUTCOME OF THESE THINGS

 HE SAID GO YOUR WAY DANIEL FOR THE WORDS ARE SHUT UP AND SEALED UNTIL THE TIME OF THE END

MANY SHALL PURIFY THEMSELVES AND MAKE THEMSELVES WHITE AND BE REFINED BUT THE WICKED SHALL ACT WICKEDLY

AND NONE OF THE WICKED SHALL UNDERSTAND BUT THOSE WHO ARE WISE SHALL UNDERSTAND

AND FROM THE TIME THAT THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING IS TAKEN AWAY AND THE ABOMINATION THAT MAKES DESOLATE IS SET UP THERE SHALL BE  DAYS

BLESSED IS HE WHO WAITS AND ARRIVES AT THE  DAYS

BUT GO YOUR WAY TILL THE END

AND YOU SHALL REST AND SHALL STAND IN YOUR ALLOTTED PLACE AT THE END OF THE DAYS

MALACHITHE ORACLE OF THE WORD OF THE LORD TO ISRAEL BY MALACHI

I HAVE LOVED YOU SAYS THE LORD

BUT YOU SAY HOW HAVE YOU LOVED US

IS NOT ESAU JACOB'S BROTHER

 DECLARES THE LORD

YET I HAVE LOVED JACOB BUT ESAU I HAVE HATED

I HAVE LAID WASTE HIS HILL COUNTRY AND LEFT HIS HERITAGE TO JACKALS OF THE DESERT

 IF EDOM SAYS WE ARE SHATTERED BUT WE WILL REBUILD THE RUINS THE LORD OF HOSTS SAYS THEY MAY BUILD BUT I WILL TEAR DOWN AND THEY WILL BE CALLED 'THE WICKED COUNTRY' AND 'THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THE LORD IS ANGRY FOREVER

' YOUR OWN EYES SHALL SEE THIS AND YOU SHALL SAY GREAT IS THE LORD BEYOND THE BORDER OF ISRAEL

 A SON HONORS HIS FATHER AND A SERVANT HIS MASTER

IF THEN I AM A FATHER WHERE IS MY HONOR

AND IF I AM A MASTER WHERE IS MY FEAR

SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS TO YOU O PRIESTS WHO DESPISE MY NAME

BUT YOU SAY 'HOW HAVE WE DESPISED YOUR NAME

' BY OFFERING POLLUTED FOOD UPON MY ALTAR

BUT YOU SAY 'HOW HAVE WE POLLUTED YOU

' BY SAYING THAT THE LORD'S TABLE MAY BE DESPISED

WHEN YOU OFFER BLIND ANIMALS IN SACRIFICE IS THAT NOT EVIL

AND WHEN YOU OFFER THOSE THAT ARE LAME OR SICK IS THAT NOT EVIL

PRESENT THAT TO YOUR GOVERNOR; WILL HE ACCEPT YOU OR SHOW YOU FAVOR

SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND NOW ENTREAT THE FAVOR OF GOD THAT HE MAY BE GRACIOUS TO US

WITH SUCH A GIFT FROM YOUR HAND WILL HE SHOW FAVOR TO ANY OF YOU

SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

OH THAT THERE WERE ONE AMONG YOU WHO WOULD SHUT THE DOORS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT KINDLE FIRE ON MY ALTAR IN VAIN

I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN YOU SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT AN OFFERING FROM YOUR HAND

FOR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING MY NAME WILL BE GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE WILL BE OFFERED TO MY NAME AND A PURE OFFERING

FOR MY NAME WILL BE GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

BUT YOU PROFANE IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE LORD'S TABLE IS POLLUTED AND ITS FRUIT THAT IS ITS FOOD MAY BE DESPISED

BUT YOU SAY 'WHAT A WEARINESS THIS IS' AND YOU SNORT AT IT SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

YOU BRING WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY VIOLENCE OR IS LAME OR SICK AND THIS YOU BRING AS YOUR OFFERING

SHALL I ACCEPT THAT FROM YOUR HAND

SAYS THE LORD

CURSED BE THE CHEAT WHO HAS A MALE IN HIS FLOCK AND VOWS IT AND YET SACRIFICES TO THE LORD WHAT IS BLEMISHED

FOR I AM A GREAT KING SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AND MY NAME WILL BE FEARED AMONG THE NATIONS

AND NOW O PRIESTS THIS COMMAND IS FOR YOU

IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN IF YOU WILL NOT TAKE IT TO HEART TO GIVE HONOR TO MY NAME SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THEN I WILL SEND THE CURSE UPON YOU AND I WILL CURSE YOUR BLESSINGS

INDEED I HAVE ALREADY CURSED THEM BECAUSE YOU DO NOT LAY IT TO HEART

BEHOLD I WILL REBUKE YOUR OFFSPRING AND SPREAD DUNG ON YOUR FACES THE DUNG OF YOUR OFFERINGS AND YOU SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY WITH IT

SO SHALL YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE SENT THIS COMMAND TO YOU THAT MY COVENANT WITH LEVI MAY STAND SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

MY COVENANT WITH HIM WAS ONE OF LIFE AND PEACE AND I GAVE THEM TO HIM

IT WAS A COVENANT OF FEAR AND HE FEARED ME

HE STOOD IN AWE OF MY NAME

TRUE INSTRUCTION WAS IN HIS MOUTH AND NO WRONG WAS FOUND ON HIS LIPS

HE WALKED WITH ME IN PEACE AND UPRIGHTNESS AND HE TURNED MANY FROM INIQUITY

FOR THE LIPS OF A PRIEST SHOULD GUARD KNOWLEDGE AND PEOPLE SHOULD SEEK INSTRUCTION FROM HIS MOUTH FOR HE IS THE MESSENGER OF THE LORD OF HOSTS

BUT YOU HAVE TURNED ASIDE FROM THE WAY

YOU HAVE CAUSED MANY TO STUMBLE BY YOUR INSTRUCTION

YOU HAVE CORRUPTED THE COVENANT OF LEVI SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AND SO I MAKE YOU DESPISED AND ABASED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE INASMUCH AS YOU DO NOT KEEP MY WAYS BUT SHOW PARTIALITY IN YOUR INSTRUCTION

 HAVE WE NOT ALL ONE FATHER

HAS NOT ONE GOD CREATED US

WHY THEN ARE WE FAITHLESS TO ONE ANOTHER PROFANING THE COVENANT OF OUR FATHERS

JUDAH HAS BEEN FAITHLESS AND ABOMINATION HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN ISRAEL AND IN JERUSALEM

FOR JUDAH HAS PROFANED THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD WHICH HE LOVES AND HAS MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A FOREIGN GOD

MAY THE LORD CUT OFF FROM THE TENTS OF JACOB ANY DESCENDANT OF THE MAN WHO DOES THIS WHO BRINGS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND THIS SECOND THING YOU DO

YOU COVER THE LORD'S ALTAR WITH TEARS WITH WEEPING AND GROANING BECAUSE HE NO LONGER REGARDS THE OFFERING OR ACCEPTS IT WITH FAVOR FROM YOUR HAND

BUT YOU SAY WHY DOES HE NOT

 BECAUSE THE LORD WAS WITNESS BETWEEN YOU AND THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH TO WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHLESS THOUGH SHE IS YOUR COMPANION AND YOUR WIFE BY COVENANT

DID HE NOT MAKE THEM ONE WITH A PORTION OF THE SPIRIT IN THEIR UNION

AND WHAT WAS THE ONE GOD SEEKING

GODLY OFFSPRING

SO GUARD YOURSELVES IN YOUR SPIRIT AND LET NONE OF YOU BE FAITHLESS TO THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH

FOR THE MAN WHO HATES AND DIVORCES SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL COVERS HIS GARMENT WITH VIOLENCE SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

SO GUARD YOURSELVES IN YOUR SPIRIT AND DO NOT BE FAITHLESS

 YOU HAVE WEARIED THE LORD WITH YOUR WORDS

BUT YOU SAY HOW HAVE WE WEARIED HIM

 BY SAYING EVERYONE WHO DOES EVIL IS GOOD IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND HE DELIGHTS IN THEM

 OR BY ASKING WHERE IS THE GOD OF JUSTICE

BEHOLD I SEND MY MESSENGER AND HE WILL PREPARE THE WAY BEFORE ME

AND THE LORD WHOM YOU SEEK WILL SUDDENLY COME TO HIS TEMPLE; AND THE MESSENGER OF THE COVENANT IN WHOM YOU DELIGHT BEHOLD HE IS COMING SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

BUT WHO CAN ENDURE THE DAY OF HIS COMING AND WHO CAN STAND WHEN HE APPEARS

FOR HE IS LIKE A REFINER'S FIRE AND LIKE FULLERS' SOAP

HE WILL SIT AS A REFINER AND PURIFIER OF SILVER AND HE WILL PURIFY THE SONS OF LEVI AND REFINE THEM LIKE GOLD AND SILVER AND THEY WILL BRING OFFERINGS IN RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE LORD

THEN THE OFFERING OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM WILL BE PLEASING TO THE LORD AS IN THE DAYS OF OLD AND AS IN FORMER YEARS

THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU FOR JUDGMENT

I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST THE SORCERERS AGAINST THE ADULTERERS AGAINST THOSE WHO SWEAR FALSELY AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPRESS THE HIRED WORKER IN HIS WAGES THE WIDOW AND THE FATHERLESS AGAINST THOSE WHO THRUST ASIDE THE SOJOURNER AND DO NOT FEAR ME SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

FOR I THE LORD DO NOT CHANGE; THEREFORE YOU O CHILDREN OF JACOB ARE NOT CONSUMED

FROM THE DAYS OF YOUR FATHERS YOU HAVE TURNED ASIDE FROM MY STATUTES AND HAVE NOT KEPT THEM

RETURN TO ME AND I WILL RETURN TO YOU SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

BUT YOU SAY 'HOW SHALL WE RETURN

' WILL MAN ROB GOD

YET YOU ARE ROBBING ME

BUT YOU SAY 'HOW HAVE WE ROBBED YOU

' IN YOUR TITHES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

YOU ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE FOR YOU ARE ROBBING ME THE WHOLE NATION OF YOU

BRING THE FULL TITHES INTO THE STOREHOUSE THAT THERE MAY BE FOOD IN MY HOUSE

AND THEREBY PUT ME TO THE TEST SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IF I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN FOR YOU AND POUR DOWN FOR YOU A BLESSING UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE NEED

I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER FOR YOU SO THAT IT WILL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF YOUR SOIL AND YOUR VINE IN THE FIELD SHALL NOT FAIL TO BEAR SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

THEN ALL NATIONS WILL CALL YOU BLESSED FOR YOU WILL BE A LAND OF DELIGHT SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

YOUR WORDS HAVE BEEN HARD AGAINST ME SAYS THE LORD

BUT YOU SAY 'HOW HAVE WE SPOKEN AGAINST YOU

' YOU HAVE SAID 'IT IS VAIN TO SERVE GOD

WHAT IS THE PROFIT OF OUR KEEPING HIS CHARGE OR OF WALKING AS IN MOURNING BEFORE THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND NOW WE CALL THE ARROGANT BLESSED

EVILDOERS NOT ONLY PROSPER BUT THEY PUT GOD TO THE TEST AND THEY ESCAPE

' THEN THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD SPOKE WITH ONE ANOTHER

THE LORD PAID ATTENTION AND HEARD THEM AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE WAS WRITTEN BEFORE HIM OF THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD AND ESTEEMED HIS NAME

THEY SHALL BE MINE SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THE DAY WHEN I MAKE UP MY TREASURED POSSESSION AND I WILL SPARE THEM AS A MAN SPARES HIS SON WHO SERVES HIM

THEN ONCE MORE YOU SHALL SEE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED BETWEEN ONE WHO SERVES GOD AND ONE WHO DOES NOT SERVE HIM

FOR BEHOLD THE DAY IS COMING BURNING LIKE AN OVEN WHEN ALL THE ARROGANT AND ALL EVILDOERS WILL BE STUBBLE

THE DAY THAT IS COMING SHALL SET THEM ABLAZE SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS SO THAT IT WILL LEAVE THEM NEITHER ROOT NOR BRANCH

BUT FOR YOU WHO FEAR MY NAME THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL RISE WITH HEALING IN ITS WINGS

YOU SHALL GO OUT LEAPING LIKE CALVES FROM THE STALL

AND YOU SHALL TREAD DOWN THE WICKED FOR THEY WILL BE ASHES UNDER THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET ON THE DAY WHEN I ACT SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

REMEMBER THE LAW OF MY SERVANT MOSES THE STATUTES AND RULES THAT I COMMANDED HIM AT HOREB FOR ALL ISRAEL

BEHOLD I WILL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD COMES

AND HE WILL TURN THE HEARTS OF FATHERS TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THE HEARTS OF CHILDREN TO THEIR FATHERS LEST I COME AND STRIKE THE LAND WITH A DECREE OF UTTER DESTRUCTION

COLOSSIANSPAUL AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS BY THE WILL OF GOD AND TIMOTHY OUR BROTHER TO THE SAINTS AND FAITHFUL BROTHERS IN CHRIST AT COLOSSAEGRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER

WE ALWAYS THANK GOD THE FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHEN WE PRAY FOR YOU SINCE WE HEARD OF YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS AND OF THE LOVE THAT YOU HAVE FOR ALL THE SAINTS BECAUSE OF THE HOPE LAID UP FOR YOU IN HEAVEN

OF THIS YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE IN THE WORD OF THE TRUTH THE GOSPEL WHICH HAS COME TO YOU AS INDEED IN THE WHOLE WORLD IT IS BEARING FRUIT AND GROWINGAS IT ALSO DOES AMONG YOU SINCE THE DAY YOU HEARD IT AND UNDERSTOOD THE GRACE OF GOD IN TRUTH JUST AS YOU LEARNED IT FROM EPAPHRAS OUR BELOVED FELLOW SERVANT

HE IS A FAITHFUL MINISTER OF CHRIST ON YOUR BEHALF AND HAS MADE KNOWN TO US YOUR LOVE IN THE SPIRIT

AND SO FROM THE DAY WE HEARD WE HAVE NOT CEASED TO PRAY FOR YOU ASKING THAT YOU MAY BE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WILL IN ALL SPIRITUAL WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING SO AS TO WALK IN A MANNER WORTHY OF THE LORD FULLY PLEASING TO HIM BEARING FRUIT IN EVERY GOOD WORK AND INCREASING IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

MAY YOU BE STRENGTHENED WITH ALL POWER ACCORDING TO HIS GLORIOUS MIGHT FOR ALL ENDURANCE AND PATIENCE WITH JOY GIVING THANKS TO THE FATHER WHO HAS QUALIFIED YOU TO SHARE IN THE INHERITANCE OF THE SAINTS IN LIGHT

HE HAS DELIVERED US FROM THE DOMAIN OF DARKNESS AND TRANSFERRED US TO THE KINGDOM OF HIS BELOVED SON IN WHOM WE HAVE REDEMPTION THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

HE IS THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION

FOR BY HIM ALL THINGS WERE CREATED IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WHETHER THRONES OR DOMINIONS OR RULERS OR AUTHORITIESALL THINGS WERE CREATED THROUGH HIM AND FOR HIM

AND HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS AND IN HIM ALL THINGS HOLD TOGETHER

AND HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BODY THE CHURCH

HE IS THE BEGINNING THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD THAT IN EVERYTHING HE MIGHT BE PREEMINENT

FOR IN HIM ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD WAS PLEASED TO DWELL AND THROUGH HIM TO RECONCILE TO HIMSELF ALL THINGS WHETHER ON EARTH OR IN HEAVEN MAKING PEACE BY THE BLOOD OF HIS CROSS

AND YOU WHO ONCE WERE ALIENATED AND HOSTILE IN MIND DOING EVIL DEEDS HE HAS NOW RECONCILED IN HIS BODY OF FLESH BY HIS DEATH IN ORDER TO PRESENT YOU HOLY AND BLAMELESS AND ABOVE REPROACH BEFORE HIM IF INDEED YOU CONTINUE IN THE FAITH STABLE AND STEADFAST NOT SHIFTING FROM THE HOPE OF THE GOSPEL THAT YOU HEARD WHICH HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED IN ALL CREATION UNDER HEAVEN AND OF WHICH I PAUL BECAME A MINISTER

NOW I REJOICE IN MY SUFFERINGS FOR YOUR SAKE AND IN MY FLESH I AM FILLING UP WHAT IS LACKING IN CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS FOR THE SAKE OF HIS BODY THAT IS THE CHURCH OF WHICH I BECAME A MINISTER ACCORDING TO THE STEWARDSHIP FROM GOD THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME FOR YOU TO MAKE THE WORD OF GOD FULLY KNOWN THE MYSTERY HIDDEN FOR AGES AND GENERATIONS BUT NOW REVEALED TO HIS SAINTS

TO THEM GOD CHOSE TO MAKE KNOWN HOW GREAT AMONG THE GENTILES ARE THE RICHES OF THE GLORY OF THIS MYSTERY WHICH IS CHRIST IN YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY

HIM WE PROCLAIM WARNING EVERYONE AND TEACHING EVERYONE WITH ALL WISDOM THAT WE MAY PRESENT EVERYONE MATURE IN CHRIST

FOR THIS I TOIL STRUGGLING WITH ALL HIS ENERGY THAT HE POWERFULLY WORKS WITHIN ME

FOR I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW GREAT A STRUGGLE I HAVE FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE AT LAODICEA AND FOR ALL WHO HAVE NOT SEEN ME FACE TO FACE THAT THEIR HEARTS MAY BE ENCOURAGED BEING KNIT TOGETHER IN LOVE TO REACH ALL THE RICHES OF FULL ASSURANCE OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S MYSTERY WHICH IS CHRIST IN WHOM ARE HIDDEN ALL THE TREASURES OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE

I SAY THIS IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MAY DELUDE YOU WITH PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENTS

FOR THOUGH I AM ABSENT IN BODY YET I AM WITH YOU IN SPIRIT REJOICING TO SEE YOUR GOOD ORDER AND THE FIRMNESS OF YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST

THEREFORE AS YOU RECEIVED CHRIST JESUS THE LORD SO WALK IN HIM ROOTED AND BUILT UP IN HIM AND ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH JUST AS YOU WERE TAUGHT ABOUNDING IN THANKSGIVING

SEE TO IT THAT NO ONE TAKES YOU CAPTIVE BY PHILOSOPHY AND EMPTY DECEIT ACCORDING TO HUMAN TRADITION ACCORDING TO THE ELEMENTAL SPIRITS OF THE WORLD AND NOT ACCORDING TO CHRIST

FOR IN HIM THE WHOLE FULLNESS OF DEITY DWELLS BODILY AND YOU HAVE BEEN FILLED IN HIM WHO IS THE HEAD OF ALL RULE AND AUTHORITY

IN HIM ALSO YOU WERE CIRCUMCISED WITH A CIRCUMCISION MADE WITHOUT HANDS BY PUTTING OFF THE BODY OF THE FLESH BY THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST HAVING BEEN BURIED WITH HIM IN BAPTISM IN WHICH YOU WERE ALSO RAISED WITH HIM THROUGH FAITH IN THE POWERFUL WORKING OF GOD WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD

AND YOU WHO WERE DEAD IN YOUR TRESPASSES AND THE UNCIRCUMCISION OF YOUR FLESH GOD MADE ALIVE TOGETHER WITH HIM HAVING FORGIVEN US ALL OUR TRESPASSES BY CANCELING THE RECORD OF DEBT THAT STOOD AGAINST US WITH ITS LEGAL DEMANDS

THIS HE SET ASIDE NAILING IT TO THE CROSS

HE DISARMED THE RULERS AND AUTHORITIES AND PUT THEM TO OPEN SHAME BY TRIUMPHING OVER THEM IN HIM

THEREFORE LET NO ONE PASS JUDGMENT ON YOU IN QUESTIONS OF FOOD AND DRINK OR WITH REGARD TO A FESTIVAL OR A NEW MOON OR A SABBATH

THESE ARE A SHADOW OF THE THINGS TO COME BUT THE SUBSTANCE BELONGS TO CHRIST

LET NO ONE DISQUALIFY YOU INSISTING ON ASCETICISM AND WORSHIP OF ANGELS GOING ON IN DETAIL ABOUT VISIONS PUFFED UP WITHOUT REASON BY HIS SENSUOUS MIND AND NOT HOLDING FAST TO THE HEAD FROM WHOM THE WHOLE BODY NOURISHED AND KNIT TOGETHER THROUGH ITS JOINTS AND LIGAMENTS GROWS WITH A GROWTH THAT IS FROM GOD

IF WITH CHRIST YOU DIED TO THE ELEMENTAL SPIRITS OF THE WORLD WHY AS IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE IN THE WORLD DO YOU SUBMIT TO REGULATIONS DO NOT HANDLE DO NOT TASTE DO NOT TOUCH REFERRING TO THINGS THAT ALL PERISH AS THEY ARE USEDACCORDING TO HUMAN PRECEPTS AND TEACHINGS

THESE HAVE INDEED AN APPEARANCE OF WISDOM IN PROMOTING SELFMADE RELIGION AND ASCETICISM AND SEVERITY TO THE BODY BUT THEY ARE OF NO VALUE IN STOPPING THE INDULGENCE OF THE FLESH

IF THEN YOU HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH CHRIST SEEK THE THINGS THAT ARE ABOVE WHERE CHRIST IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD

SET YOUR MINDS ON THINGS THAT ARE ABOVE NOT ON THINGS THAT ARE ON EARTH

FOR YOU HAVE DIED AND YOUR LIFE IS HIDDEN WITH CHRIST IN GOD

WHEN CHRIST WHO IS YOUR LIFE APPEARS THEN YOU ALSO WILL APPEAR WITH HIM IN GLORY

PUT TO DEATH THEREFORE WHAT IS EARTHLY IN YOU SEXUAL IMMORALITY IMPURITY PASSION EVIL DESIRE AND COVETOUSNESS WHICH IS IDOLATRY

ON ACCOUNT OF THESE THE WRATH OF GOD IS COMING

IN THESE YOU TOO ONCE WALKED WHEN YOU WERE LIVING IN THEM

BUT NOW YOU MUST PUT THEM ALL AWAY ANGER WRATH MALICE SLANDER AND OBSCENE TALK FROM YOUR MOUTH

DO NOT LIE TO ONE ANOTHER SEEING THAT YOU HAVE PUT OFF THE OLD SELF WITH ITS PRACTICES AND HAVE PUT ON THE NEW SELF WHICH IS BEING RENEWED IN KNOWLEDGE AFTER THE IMAGE OF ITS CREATOR

HERE THERE IS NOT GREEK AND JEW CIRCUMCISED AND UNCIRCUMCISED BARBARIAN SCYTHIAN SLAVE FREE; BUT CHRIST IS ALL AND IN ALL

PUT ON THEN AS GOD'S CHOSEN ONES HOLY AND BELOVED COMPASSION KINDNESS HUMILITY MEEKNESS AND PATIENCE BEARING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IF ONE HAS A COMPLAINT AGAINST ANOTHER FORGIVING EACH OTHER; AS THE LORD HAS FORGIVEN YOU SO YOU ALSO MUST FORGIVE

AND ABOVE ALL THESE PUT ON LOVE WHICH BINDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER IN PERFECT HARMONY

AND LET THE PEACE OF CHRIST RULE IN YOUR HEARTS TO WHICH INDEED YOU WERE CALLED IN ONE BODY

AND BE THANKFUL

LET THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN YOU RICHLY TEACHING AND ADMONISHING ONE ANOTHER IN ALL WISDOM SINGING PSALMS AND HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS WITH THANKFULNESS IN YOUR HEARTS TO GOD

AND WHATEVER YOU DO IN WORD OR DEED DO EVERYTHING IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS GIVING THANKS TO GOD THE FATHER THROUGH HIM

WIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS AS IS FITTING IN THE LORD

HUSBANDS LOVE YOUR WIVES AND DO NOT BE HARSH WITH THEM

CHILDREN OBEY YOUR PARENTS IN EVERYTHING FOR THIS PLEASES THE LORD

FATHERS DO NOT PROVOKE YOUR CHILDREN LEST THEY BECOME DISCOURAGED

SLAVES OBEY IN EVERYTHING THOSE WHO ARE YOUR EARTHLY MASTERS NOT BY WAY OF EYESERVICE AS PEOPLEPLEASERS BUT WITH SINCERITY OF HEART FEARING THE LORD

WHATEVER YOU DO WORK HEARTILY AS FOR THE LORD AND NOT FOR MEN KNOWING THAT FROM THE LORD YOU WILL RECEIVE THE INHERITANCE AS YOUR REWARD

YOU ARE SERVING THE LORD CHRIST

FOR THE WRONGDOER WILL BE PAID BACK FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE AND THERE IS NO PARTIALITY

MASTERS TREAT YOUR SLAVES JUSTLY AND FAIRLY KNOWING THAT YOU ALSO HAVE A MASTER IN HEAVEN

CONTINUE STEADFASTLY IN PRAYER BEING WATCHFUL IN IT WITH THANKSGIVING

AT THE SAME TIME PRAY ALSO FOR US THAT GOD MAY OPEN TO US A DOOR FOR THE WORD TO DECLARE THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH I AM IN PRISON THAT I MAY MAKE IT CLEAR WHICH IS HOW I OUGHT TO SPEAK

CONDUCT YOURSELVES WISELY TOWARD OUTSIDERS MAKING THE BEST USE OF THE TIME

LET YOUR SPEECH ALWAYS BE GRACIOUS SEASONED WITH SALT SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW HOW YOU OUGHT TO ANSWER EACH PERSON

TYCHICUS WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MY ACTIVITIES

HE IS A BELOVED BROTHER AND FAITHFUL MINISTER AND FELLOW SERVANT IN THE LORD

I HAVE SENT HIM TO YOU FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE THAT YOU MAY KNOW HOW WE ARE AND THAT HE MAY ENCOURAGE YOUR HEARTS AND WITH HIM ONESIMUS OUR FAITHFUL AND BELOVED BROTHER WHO IS ONE OF YOU

THEY WILL TELL YOU OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE

ARISTARCHUS MY FELLOW PRISONER GREETS YOU AND MARK THE COUSIN OF BARNABAS CONCERNING WHOM YOU HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONSIF HE COMES TO YOU WELCOME HIM AND JESUS WHO IS CALLED JUSTUS

THESE ARE THE ONLY MEN OF THE CIRCUMCISION AMONG MY FELLOW WORKERS FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND THEY HAVE BEEN A COMFORT TO ME

EPAPHRAS WHO IS ONE OF YOU A SERVANT OF CHRIST JESUS GREETS YOU ALWAYS STRUGGLING ON YOUR BEHALF IN HIS PRAYERS THAT YOU MAY STAND MATURE AND FULLY ASSURED IN ALL THE WILL OF GOD

FOR I BEAR HIM WITNESS THAT HE HAS WORKED HARD FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE IN LAODICEA AND IN HIERAPOLIS

LUKE THE BELOVED PHYSICIAN GREETS YOU AS DOES DEMAS

GIVE MY GREETINGS TO THE BROTHERS AT LAODICEA AND TO NYMPHA AND THE CHURCH IN HER HOUSE

AND WHEN THIS LETTER HAS BEEN READ AMONG YOU HAVE IT ALSO READ IN THE CHURCH OF THE LAODICEANS; AND SEE THAT YOU ALSO READ THE LETTER FROM LAODICEA

AND SAY TO ARCHIPPUS SEE THAT YOU FULFILL THE MINISTRY THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED IN THE LORD

 I PAUL WRITE THIS GREETING WITH MY OWN HAND

REMEMBER MY CHAINS

GRACE BE WITH YOU

RUTHIN THE DAYS WHEN THE JUDGES RULED THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND AND A MAN OF BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH WENT TO SOJOURN IN THE COUNTRY OF MOAB HE AND HIS WIFE AND HIS TWO SONS

THE NAME OF THE MAN WAS ELIMELECH AND THE NAME OF HIS WIFE NAOMI AND THE NAMES OF HIS TWO SONS WERE MAHLON AND CHILION

THEY WERE EPHRATHITES FROM BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH

THEY WENT INTO THE COUNTRY OF MOAB AND REMAINED THERE

BUT ELIMELECH THE HUSBAND OF NAOMI DIED AND SHE WAS LEFT WITH HER TWO SONS

THESE TOOK MOABITE WIVES; THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ORPAH AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER RUTH

THEY LIVED THERE ABOUT TEN YEARS AND BOTH MAHLON AND CHILION DIED SO THAT THE WOMAN WAS LEFT WITHOUT HER TWO SONS AND HER HUSBAND

THEN SHE AROSE WITH HER DAUGHTERSINLAW TO RETURN FROM THE COUNTRY OF MOAB FOR SHE HAD HEARD IN THE FIELDS OF MOAB THAT THE LORD HAD VISITED HIS PEOPLE AND GIVEN THEM FOOD

SO SHE SET OUT FROM THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERSINLAW AND THEY WENT ON THE WAY TO RETURN TO THE LAND OF JUDAH

BUT NAOMI SAID TO HER TWO DAUGHTERSINLAW GO RETURN EACH OF YOU TO HER MOTHER'S HOUSE

MAY THE LORD DEAL KINDLY WITH YOU AS YOU HAVE DEALT WITH THE DEAD AND WITH ME

THE LORD GRANT THAT YOU MAY FIND REST EACH OF YOU IN THE HOUSE OF HER HUSBAND

 THEN SHE KISSED THEM AND THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND WEPT

AND THEY SAID TO HER NO WE WILL RETURN WITH YOU TO YOUR PEOPLE

 BUT NAOMI SAID TURN BACK MY DAUGHTERS; WHY WILL YOU GO WITH ME

HAVE I YET SONS IN MY WOMB THAT THEY MAY BECOME YOUR HUSBANDS

TURN BACK MY DAUGHTERS; GO YOUR WAY FOR I AM TOO OLD TO HAVE A HUSBAND

IF I SHOULD SAY I HAVE HOPE EVEN IF I SHOULD HAVE A HUSBAND THIS NIGHT AND SHOULD BEAR SONS WOULD YOU THEREFORE WAIT TILL THEY WERE GROWN

WOULD YOU THEREFORE REFRAIN FROM MARRYING

NO MY DAUGHTERS FOR IT IS EXCEEDINGLY BITTER TO ME FOR YOUR SAKE THAT THE HAND OF THE LORD HAS GONE OUT AGAINST ME

 THEN THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND WEPT AGAIN

AND ORPAH KISSED HER MOTHERINLAW BUT RUTH CLUNG TO HER

AND SHE SAID SEE YOUR SISTERINLAW HAS GONE BACK TO HER PEOPLE AND TO HER GODS; RETURN AFTER YOUR SISTERINLAW

 BUT RUTH SAID DO NOT URGE ME TO LEAVE YOU OR TO RETURN FROM FOLLOWING YOU

FOR WHERE YOU GO I WILL GO AND WHERE YOU LODGE I WILL LODGE

YOUR PEOPLE SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND YOUR GOD MY GOD

WHERE YOU DIE I WILL DIE AND THERE WILL I BE BURIED

MAY THE LORD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF ANYTHING BUT DEATH PARTS ME FROM YOU

 AND WHEN NAOMI SAW THAT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO GO WITH HER SHE SAID NO MORE

SO THE TWO OF THEM WENT ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO BETHLEHEM

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO BETHLEHEM THE WHOLE TOWN WAS STIRRED BECAUSE OF THEM

AND THE WOMEN SAID IS THIS NAOMI

 SHE SAID TO THEM DO NOT CALL ME NAOMI; CALL ME MARA FOR THE ALMIGHTY HAS DEALT VERY BITTERLY WITH ME

I WENT AWAY FULL AND THE LORD HAS BROUGHT ME BACK EMPTY

WHY CALL ME NAOMI WHEN THE LORD HAS TESTIFIED AGAINST ME AND THE ALMIGHTY HAS BROUGHT CALAMITY UPON ME

 SO NAOMI RETURNED AND RUTH THE MOABITE HER DAUGHTERINLAW WITH HER WHO RETURNED FROM THE COUNTRY OF MOAB

AND THEY CAME TO BETHLEHEM AT THE BEGINNING OF BARLEY HARVEST

NOW NAOMI HAD A RELATIVE OF HER HUSBAND'S A WORTHY MAN OF THE CLAN OF ELIMELECH WHOSE NAME WAS BOAZ

AND RUTH THE MOABITE SAID TO NAOMI LET ME GO TO THE FIELD AND GLEAN AMONG THE EARS OF GRAIN AFTER HIM IN WHOSE SIGHT I SHALL FIND FAVOR

 AND SHE SAID TO HER GO MY DAUGHTER

 SO SHE SET OUT AND WENT AND GLEANED IN THE FIELD AFTER THE REAPERS AND SHE HAPPENED TO COME TO THE PART OF THE FIELD BELONGING TO BOAZ WHO WAS OF THE CLAN OF ELIMELECH

AND BEHOLD BOAZ CAME FROM BETHLEHEM

AND HE SAID TO THE REAPERS THE LORD BE WITH YOU

 AND THEY ANSWERED THE LORD BLESS YOU

 THEN BOAZ SAID TO HIS YOUNG MAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE REAPERS WHOSE YOUNG WOMAN IS THIS

 AND THE SERVANT WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE REAPERS ANSWERED SHE IS THE YOUNG MOABITE WOMAN WHO CAME BACK WITH NAOMI FROM THE COUNTRY OF MOAB

SHE SAID 'PLEASE LET ME GLEAN AND GATHER AMONG THE SHEAVES AFTER THE REAPERS

' SO SHE CAME AND SHE HAS CONTINUED FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL NOW EXCEPT FOR A SHORT REST

 THEN BOAZ SAID TO RUTH NOW LISTEN MY DAUGHTER DO NOT GO TO GLEAN IN ANOTHER FIELD OR LEAVE THIS ONE BUT KEEP CLOSE TO MY YOUNG WOMEN

LET YOUR EYES BE ON THE FIELD THAT THEY ARE REAPING AND GO AFTER THEM

HAVE I NOT CHARGED THE YOUNG MEN NOT TO TOUCH YOU

AND WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY GO TO THE VESSELS AND DRINK WHAT THE YOUNG MEN HAVE DRAWN

 THEN SHE FELL ON HER FACE BOWING TO THE GROUND AND SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE I FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTICE OF ME SINCE I AM A FOREIGNER

 BUT BOAZ ANSWERED HER ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR YOUR MOTHERINLAW SINCE THE DEATH OF YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN FULLY TOLD TO ME AND HOW YOU LEFT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER AND YOUR NATIVE LAND AND CAME TO A PEOPLE THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW BEFORE

THE LORD REPAY YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND A FULL REWARD BE GIVEN YOU BY THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL UNDER WHOSE WINGS YOU HAVE COME TO TAKE REFUGE

 THEN SHE SAID I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES MY LORD FOR YOU HAVE COMFORTED ME AND SPOKEN KINDLY TO YOUR SERVANT THOUGH I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR SERVANTS

 AND AT MEALTIME BOAZ SAID TO HER COME HERE AND EAT SOME BREAD AND DIP YOUR MORSEL IN THE WINE

 SO SHE SAT BESIDE THE REAPERS AND HE PASSED TO HER ROASTED GRAIN

AND SHE ATE UNTIL SHE WAS SATISFIED AND SHE HAD SOME LEFT OVER

WHEN SHE ROSE TO GLEAN BOAZ INSTRUCTED HIS YOUNG MEN SAYING LET HER GLEAN EVEN AMONG THE SHEAVES AND DO NOT REPROACH HER

AND ALSO PULL OUT SOME FROM THE BUNDLES FOR HER AND LEAVE IT FOR HER TO GLEAN AND DO NOT REBUKE HER

 SO SHE GLEANED IN THE FIELD UNTIL EVENING

THEN SHE BEAT OUT WHAT SHE HAD GLEANED AND IT WAS ABOUT AN EPHAH OF BARLEY

AND SHE TOOK IT UP AND WENT INTO THE CITY

HER MOTHERINLAW SAW WHAT SHE HAD GLEANED

SHE ALSO BROUGHT OUT AND GAVE HER WHAT FOOD SHE HAD LEFT OVER AFTER BEING SATISFIED

AND HER MOTHERINLAW SAID TO HER WHERE DID YOU GLEAN TODAY

AND WHERE HAVE YOU WORKED

BLESSED BE THE MAN WHO TOOK NOTICE OF YOU

 SO SHE TOLD HER MOTHERINLAW WITH WHOM SHE HAD WORKED AND SAID THE MAN'S NAME WITH WHOM I WORKED TODAY IS BOAZ

 AND NAOMI SAID TO HER DAUGHTERINLAW MAY HE BE BLESSED BY THE LORD WHOSE KINDNESS HAS NOT FORSAKEN THE LIVING OR THE DEAD

 NAOMI ALSO SAID TO HER THE MAN IS A CLOSE RELATIVE OF OURS ONE OF OUR REDEEMERS

 AND RUTH THE MOABITE SAID BESIDES HE SAID TO ME 'YOU SHALL KEEP CLOSE BY MY YOUNG MEN UNTIL THEY HAVE FINISHED ALL MY HARVEST

' AND NAOMI SAID TO RUTH HER DAUGHTERINLAW IT IS GOOD MY DAUGHTER THAT YOU GO OUT WITH HIS YOUNG WOMEN LEST IN ANOTHER FIELD YOU BE ASSAULTED

 SO SHE KEPT CLOSE TO THE YOUNG WOMEN OF BOAZ GLEANING UNTIL THE END OF THE BARLEY AND WHEAT HARVESTS

AND SHE LIVED WITH HER MOTHERINLAW

THEN NAOMI HER MOTHERINLAW SAID TO HER MY DAUGHTER SHOULD I NOT SEEK REST FOR YOU THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU

IS NOT BOAZ OUR RELATIVE WITH WHOSE YOUNG WOMEN YOU WERE

SEE HE IS WINNOWING BARLEY TONIGHT AT THE THRESHING FLOOR

WASH THEREFORE AND ANOINT YOURSELF AND PUT ON YOUR CLOAK AND GO DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR BUT DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN TO THE MAN UNTIL HE HAS FINISHED EATING AND DRINKING

BUT WHEN HE LIES DOWN OBSERVE THE PLACE WHERE HE LIES

THEN GO AND UNCOVER HIS FEET AND LIE DOWN AND HE WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO

 AND SHE REPLIED ALL THAT YOU SAY I WILL DO

 SO SHE WENT DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR AND DID JUST AS HER MOTHERINLAW HAD COMMANDED HER

AND WHEN BOAZ HAD EATEN AND DRUNK AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY HE WENT TO LIE DOWN AT THE END OF THE HEAP OF GRAIN

THEN SHE CAME SOFTLY AND UNCOVERED HIS FEET AND LAY DOWN

AT MIDNIGHT THE MAN WAS STARTLED AND TURNED OVER AND BEHOLD A WOMAN LAY AT HIS FEET

HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

 AND SHE ANSWERED I AM RUTH YOUR SERVANT

SPREAD YOUR WINGS OVER YOUR SERVANT FOR YOU ARE A REDEEMER

 AND HE SAID MAY YOU BE BLESSED BY THE LORD MY DAUGHTER

YOU HAVE MADE THIS LAST KINDNESS GREATER THAN THE FIRST IN THAT YOU HAVE NOT GONE AFTER YOUNG MEN WHETHER POOR OR RICH

AND NOW MY DAUGHTER DO NOT FEAR

I WILL DO FOR YOU ALL THAT YOU ASK FOR ALL MY FELLOW TOWNSMEN KNOW THAT YOU ARE A WORTHY WOMAN

AND NOW IT IS TRUE THAT I AM A REDEEMER

YET THERE IS A REDEEMER NEARER THAN I

REMAIN TONIGHT AND IN THE MORNING IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU GOOD; LET HIM DO IT

BUT IF HE IS NOT WILLING TO REDEEM YOU THEN AS THE LORD LIVES I WILL REDEEM YOU

LIE DOWN UNTIL THE MORNING

 SO SHE LAY AT HIS FEET UNTIL THE MORNING BUT AROSE BEFORE ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ANOTHER

AND HE SAID LET IT NOT BE KNOWN THAT THE WOMAN CAME TO THE THRESHING FLOOR

 AND HE SAID BRING THE GARMENT YOU ARE WEARING AND HOLD IT OUT

 SO SHE HELD IT AND HE MEASURED OUT SIX MEASURES OF BARLEY AND PUT IT ON HER

THEN SHE WENT INTO THE CITY

AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HER MOTHERINLAW SHE SAID HOW DID YOU FARE MY DAUGHTER

 THEN SHE TOLD HER ALL THAT THE MAN HAD DONE FOR HER SAYING THESE SIX MEASURES OF BARLEY HE GAVE TO ME FOR HE SAID TO ME 'YOU MUST NOT GO BACK EMPTYHANDED TO YOUR MOTHERINLAW

' SHE REPLIED WAIT MY DAUGHTER UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW THE MATTER TURNS OUT FOR THE MAN WILL NOT REST BUT WILL SETTLE THE MATTER TODAY

NOW BOAZ HAD GONE UP TO THE GATE AND SAT DOWN THERE

AND BEHOLD THE REDEEMER OF WHOM BOAZ HAD SPOKEN CAME BY

SO BOAZ SAID TURN ASIDE FRIEND; SIT DOWN HERE

 AND HE TURNED ASIDE AND SAT DOWN

AND HE TOOK TEN MEN OF THE ELDERS OF THE CITY AND SAID SIT DOWN HERE

 SO THEY SAT DOWN

THEN HE SAID TO THE REDEEMER NAOMI WHO HAS COME BACK FROM THE COUNTRY OF MOAB IS SELLING THE PARCEL OF LAND THAT BELONGED TO OUR RELATIVE ELIMELECH

SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU OF IT AND SAY 'BUY IT IN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE SITTING HERE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ELDERS OF MY PEOPLE

' IF YOU WILL REDEEM IT REDEEM IT

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT TELL ME THAT I MAY KNOW FOR THERE IS NO ONE BESIDES YOU TO REDEEM IT AND I COME AFTER YOU

 AND HE SAID I WILL REDEEM IT

 THEN BOAZ SAID THE DAY YOU BUY THE FIELD FROM THE HAND OF NAOMI YOU ALSO ACQUIRE RUTH THE MOABITE THE WIDOW OF THE DEAD IN ORDER TO PERPETUATE THE NAME OF THE DEAD IN HIS INHERITANCE

 THEN THE REDEEMER SAID I CANNOT REDEEM IT FOR MYSELF LEST I IMPAIR MY OWN INHERITANCE

TAKE MY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION YOURSELF FOR I CANNOT REDEEM IT

 NOW THIS WAS THE CUSTOM IN FORMER TIMES IN ISRAEL CONCERNING REDEEMING AND EXCHANGING TO CONFIRM A TRANSACTION THE ONE DREW OFF HIS SANDAL AND GAVE IT TO THE OTHER AND THIS WAS THE MANNER OF ATTESTING IN ISRAEL

SO WHEN THE REDEEMER SAID TO BOAZ BUY IT FOR YOURSELF HE DREW OFF HIS SANDAL

THEN BOAZ SAID TO THE ELDERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WITNESSES THIS DAY THAT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM THE HAND OF NAOMI ALL THAT BELONGED TO ELIMELECH AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO CHILION AND TO MAHLON

ALSO RUTH THE MOABITE THE WIDOW OF MAHLON I HAVE BOUGHT TO BE MY WIFE TO PERPETUATE THE NAME OF THE DEAD IN HIS INHERITANCE THAT THE NAME OF THE DEAD MAY NOT BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG HIS BROTHERS AND FROM THE GATE OF HIS NATIVE PLACE

YOU ARE WITNESSES THIS DAY

 THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE GATE AND THE ELDERS SAID WE ARE WITNESSES

MAY THE LORD MAKE THE WOMAN WHO IS COMING INTO YOUR HOUSE LIKE RACHEL AND LEAH WHO TOGETHER BUILT UP THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

MAY YOU ACT WORTHILY IN EPHRATHAH AND BE RENOWNED IN BETHLEHEM AND MAY YOUR HOUSE BE LIKE THE HOUSE OF PEREZ WHOM TAMAR BORE TO JUDAH BECAUSE OF THE OFFSPRING THAT THE LORD WILL GIVE YOU BY THIS YOUNG WOMAN

 SO BOAZ TOOK RUTH AND SHE BECAME HIS WIFE

AND HE WENT IN TO HER AND THE LORD GAVE HER CONCEPTION AND SHE BORE A SON

THEN THE WOMEN SAID TO NAOMI BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO HAS NOT LEFT YOU THIS DAY WITHOUT A REDEEMER AND MAY HIS NAME BE RENOWNED IN ISRAEL

HE SHALL BE TO YOU A RESTORER OF LIFE AND A NOURISHER OF YOUR OLD AGE FOR YOUR DAUGHTERINLAW WHO LOVES YOU WHO IS MORE TO YOU THAN SEVEN SONS HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO HIM

 THEN NAOMI TOOK THE CHILD AND LAID HIM ON HER LAP AND BECAME HIS NURSE

AND THE WOMEN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD GAVE HIM A NAME SAYING A SON HAS BEEN BORN TO NAOMI

 THEY NAMED HIM OBED

HE WAS THE FATHER OF JESSE THE FATHER OF DAVID

NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF PEREZ PEREZ FATHERED HEZRON HEZRON FATHERED RAM RAM FATHERED AMMINADAB AMMINADAB FATHERED NAHSHON NAHSHON FATHERED SALMON SALMON FATHERED BOAZ BOAZ FATHERED OBED OBED FATHERED JESSE AND JESSE FATHERED DAVID

GENESISIN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH

THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID AND DARKNESS WAS OVER THE FACE OF THE DEEP

AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS

AND GOD SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT

AND GOD SAW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOOD

AND GOD SEPARATED THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS

GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY AND THE DARKNESS HE CALLED NIGHT

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE FIRST DAY

AND GOD SAID LET THERE BE AN EXPANSE IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS AND LET IT SEPARATE THE WATERS FROM THE WATERS

 AND GOD MADE THE EXPANSE AND SEPARATED THE WATERS THAT WERE UNDER THE EXPANSE FROM THE WATERS THAT WERE ABOVE THE EXPANSE

AND IT WAS SO

AND GOD CALLED THE EXPANSE HEAVEN

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE SECOND DAY

AND GOD SAID LET THE WATERS UNDER THE HEAVENS BE GATHERED TOGETHER INTO ONE PLACE AND LET THE DRY LAND APPEAR

 AND IT WAS SO

GOD CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH AND THE WATERS THAT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER HE CALLED SEAS

AND GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD

AND GOD SAID LET THE EARTH SPROUT VEGETATION PLANTS YIELDING SEED AND FRUIT TREES BEARING FRUIT IN WHICH IS THEIR SEED EACH ACCORDING TO ITS KIND ON THE EARTH

 AND IT WAS SO

THE EARTH BROUGHT FORTH VEGETATION PLANTS YIELDING SEED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN KINDS AND TREES BEARING FRUIT IN WHICH IS THEIR SEED EACH ACCORDING TO ITS KIND

AND GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE THIRD DAY

AND GOD SAID LET THERE BE LIGHTS IN THE EXPANSE OF THE HEAVENS TO SEPARATE THE DAY FROM THE NIGHT

AND LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS AND FOR DAYS AND YEARS AND LET THEM BE LIGHTS IN THE EXPANSE OF THE HEAVENS TO GIVE LIGHT UPON THE EARTH

 AND IT WAS SO

AND GOD MADE THE TWO GREAT LIGHTSTHE GREATER LIGHT TO RULE THE DAY AND THE LESSER LIGHT TO RULE THE NIGHTAND THE STARS

AND GOD SET THEM IN THE EXPANSE OF THE HEAVENS TO GIVE LIGHT ON THE EARTH TO RULE OVER THE DAY AND OVER THE NIGHT AND TO SEPARATE THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS

AND GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE FOURTH DAY

AND GOD SAID LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES AND LET BIRDS FLY ABOVE THE EARTH ACROSS THE EXPANSE OF THE HEAVENS

 SO GOD CREATED THE GREAT SEA CREATURES AND EVERY LIVING CREATURE THAT MOVES WITH WHICH THE WATERS SWARM ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS AND EVERY WINGED BIRD ACCORDING TO ITS KIND

AND GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD

AND GOD BLESSED THEM SAYING BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND FILL THE WATERS IN THE SEAS AND LET BIRDS MULTIPLY ON THE EARTH

 AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE FIFTH DAY

AND GOD SAID LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH LIVING CREATURES ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDSLIVESTOCK AND CREEPING THINGS AND BEASTS OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS

 AND IT WAS SO

AND GOD MADE THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS AND THE LIVESTOCK ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS AND EVERYTHING THAT CREEPS ON THE GROUND ACCORDING TO ITS KIND

AND GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD

THEN GOD SAID LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE AFTER OUR LIKENESS

AND LET THEM HAVE DOMINION OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA AND OVER THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND OVER THE LIVESTOCK AND OVER ALL THE EARTH AND OVER EVERY CREEPING THING THAT CREEPS ON THE EARTH

 SO GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD HE CREATED HIM; MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM

AND GOD BLESSED THEM

AND GOD SAID TO THEM BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND FILL THE EARTH AND SUBDUE IT AND HAVE DOMINION OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA AND OVER THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND OVER EVERY LIVING THING THAT MOVES ON THE EARTH

 AND GOD SAID BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOU EVERY PLANT YIELDING SEED THAT IS ON THE FACE OF ALL THE EARTH AND EVERY TREE WITH SEED IN ITS FRUIT

YOU SHALL HAVE THEM FOR FOOD

AND TO EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH AND TO EVERY BIRD OF THE HEAVENS AND TO EVERYTHING THAT CREEPS ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING THAT HAS THE BREATH OF LIFE I HAVE GIVEN EVERY GREEN PLANT FOR FOOD

 AND IT WAS SO

AND GOD SAW EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD MADE AND BEHOLD IT WAS VERY GOOD

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING THE SIXTH DAY

THUS THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WERE FINISHED AND ALL THE HOST OF THEM

AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY GOD FINISHED HIS WORK THAT HE HAD DONE AND HE RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORK THAT HE HAD DONE

SO GOD BLESSED THE SEVENTH DAY AND MADE IT HOLY BECAUSE ON IT GOD RESTED FROM ALL HIS WORK THAT HE HAD DONE IN CREATION

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE THE EARTH AND THE HEAVENS

WHEN NO BUSH OF THE FIELD WAS YET IN THE LAND AND NO SMALL PLANT OF THE FIELD HAD YET SPRUNG UPFOR THE LORD GOD HAD NOT CAUSED IT TO RAIN ON THE LAND AND THERE WAS NO MAN TO WORK THE GROUND AND A MIST WAS GOING UP FROM THE LAND AND WAS WATERING THE WHOLE FACE OF THE GROUND THEN THE LORD GOD FORMED THE MAN OF DUST FROM THE GROUND AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE AND THE MAN BECAME A LIVING CREATURE

AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN IN EDEN IN THE EAST AND THERE HE PUT THE MAN WHOM HE HAD FORMED

AND OUT OF THE GROUND THE LORD GOD MADE TO SPRING UP EVERY TREE THAT IS PLEASANT TO THE SIGHT AND GOOD FOR FOOD

THE TREE OF LIFE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE GARDEN AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL

A RIVER FLOWED OUT OF EDEN TO WATER THE GARDEN AND THERE IT DIVIDED AND BECAME FOUR RIVERS

THE NAME OF THE FIRST IS THE PISHON

IT IS THE ONE THAT FLOWED AROUND THE WHOLE LAND OF HAVILAH WHERE THERE IS GOLD

AND THE GOLD OF THAT LAND IS GOOD; BDELLIUM AND ONYX STONE ARE THERE

THE NAME OF THE SECOND RIVER IS THE GIHON

IT IS THE ONE THAT FLOWED AROUND THE WHOLE LAND OF CUSH

AND THE NAME OF THE THIRD RIVER IS THE TIGRIS WHICH FLOWS EAST OF ASSYRIA

AND THE FOURTH RIVER IS THE EUPHRATES

THE LORD GOD TOOK THE MAN AND PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO WORK IT AND KEEP IT

AND THE LORD GOD COMMANDED THE MAN SAYING YOU MAY SURELY EAT OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN BUT OF THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL YOU SHALL NOT EAT FOR IN THE DAY THAT YOU EAT OF IT YOU SHALL SURELY DIE

 THEN THE LORD GOD SAID IT IS NOT GOOD THAT THE MAN SHOULD BE ALONE; I WILL MAKE HIM A HELPER FIT FOR HIM

 SO OUT OF THE GROUND THE LORD GOD FORMED EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD AND EVERY BIRD OF THE HEAVENS AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE MAN TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD CALL THEM

AND WHATEVER THE MAN CALLED EVERY LIVING CREATURE THAT WAS ITS NAME

THE MAN GAVE NAMES TO ALL LIVESTOCK AND TO THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND TO EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD

BUT FOR ADAM THERE WAS NOT FOUND A HELPER FIT FOR HIM

SO THE LORD GOD CAUSED A DEEP SLEEP TO FALL UPON THE MAN AND WHILE HE SLEPT TOOK ONE OF HIS RIBS AND CLOSED UP ITS PLACE WITH FLESH

AND THE RIB THAT THE LORD GOD HAD TAKEN FROM THE MAN HE MADE INTO A WOMAN AND BROUGHT HER TO THE MAN

THEN THE MAN SAID THIS AT LAST IS BONE OF MY BONES AND FLESH OF MY FLESH; SHE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN

 THEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND HOLD FAST TO HIS WIFE AND THEY SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH

AND THE MAN AND HIS WIFE WERE BOTH NAKED AND WERE NOT ASHAMED

NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE CRAFTY THAN ANY OTHER BEAST OF THE FIELD THAT THE LORD GOD HAD MADE

HE SAID TO THE WOMAN DID GOD ACTUALLY SAY 'YOU SHALL NOT EAT OF ANY TREE IN THE GARDEN'

 AND THE WOMAN SAID TO THE SERPENT WE MAY EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES IN THE GARDEN BUT GOD SAID 'YOU SHALL NOT EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE THAT IS IN THE MIDST OF THE GARDEN NEITHER SHALL YOU TOUCH IT LEST YOU DIE

' BUT THE SERPENT SAID TO THE WOMAN YOU WILL NOT SURELY DIE

FOR GOD KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU EAT OF IT YOUR EYES WILL BE OPENED AND YOU WILL BE LIKE GOD KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL

 SO WHEN THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR FOOD AND THAT IT WAS A DELIGHT TO THE EYES AND THAT THE TREE WAS TO BE DESIRED TO MAKE ONE WISE SHE TOOK OF ITS FRUIT AND ATE AND SHE ALSO GAVE SOME TO HER HUSBAND WHO WAS WITH HER AND HE ATE

THEN THE EYES OF BOTH WERE OPENED AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE NAKED

AND THEY SEWED FIG LEAVES TOGETHER AND MADE THEMSELVES LOINCLOTHS

AND THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE LORD GOD WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN THE COOL OF THE DAY AND THE MAN AND HIS WIFE HID THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD GOD AMONG THE TREES OF THE GARDEN

BUT THE LORD GOD CALLED TO THE MAN AND SAID TO HIM WHERE ARE YOU

 AND HE SAID I HEARD THE SOUND OF YOU IN THE GARDEN AND I WAS AFRAID BECAUSE I WAS NAKED AND I HID MYSELF

 HE SAID WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE NAKED

HAVE YOU EATEN OF THE TREE OF WHICH I COMMANDED YOU NOT TO EAT

 THE MAN SAID THE WOMAN WHOM YOU GAVE TO BE WITH ME SHE GAVE ME FRUIT OF THE TREE AND I ATE

 THEN THE LORD GOD SAID TO THE WOMAN WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE

 THE WOMAN SAID THE SERPENT DECEIVED ME AND I ATE

 THE LORD GOD SAID TO THE SERPENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS CURSED ARE YOU ABOVE ALL LIVESTOCK AND ABOVE ALL BEASTS OF THE FIELD; ON YOUR BELLY YOU SHALL GO AND DUST YOU SHALL EAT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE

I WILL PUT ENMITY BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN AND BETWEEN YOUR OFFSPRING AND HER OFFSPRING; HE SHALL BRUISE YOUR HEAD AND YOU SHALL BRUISE HIS HEEL

 TO THE WOMAN HE SAID I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOUR PAIN IN CHILDBEARING; IN PAIN YOU SHALL BRING FORTH CHILDREN

YOUR DESIRE SHALL BE FOR YOUR HUSBAND AND HE SHALL RULE OVER YOU

 AND TO ADAM HE SAID BECAUSE YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF YOUR WIFE AND HAVE EATEN OF THE TREE OF WHICH I COMMANDED YOU 'YOU SHALL NOT EAT OF IT' CURSED IS THE GROUND BECAUSE OF YOU; IN PAIN YOU SHALL EAT OF IT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE; THORNS AND THISTLES IT SHALL BRING FORTH FOR YOU; AND YOU SHALL EAT THE PLANTS OF THE FIELD

BY THE SWEAT OF YOUR FACE YOU SHALL EAT BREAD TILL YOU RETURN TO THE GROUND FOR OUT OF IT YOU WERE TAKEN; FOR YOU ARE DUST AND TO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN

 THE MAN CALLED HIS WIFE'S NAME EVE BECAUSE SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING

AND THE LORD GOD MADE FOR ADAM AND FOR HIS WIFE GARMENTS OF SKINS AND CLOTHED THEM

THEN THE LORD GOD SAID BEHOLD THE MAN HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US IN KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL

NOW LEST HE REACH OUT HIS HAND AND TAKE ALSO OF THE TREE OF LIFE AND EAT AND LIVE FOREVER THEREFORE THE LORD GOD SENT HIM OUT FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO WORK THE GROUND FROM WHICH HE WAS TAKEN

HE DROVE OUT THE MAN AND AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE PLACED THE CHERUBIM AND A FLAMING SWORD THAT TURNED EVERY WAY TO GUARD THE WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE

NOW ADAM KNEW EVE HIS WIFE AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE CAIN SAYING I HAVE GOTTEN A MAN WITH THE HELP OF THE LORD

 AND AGAIN SHE BORE HIS BROTHER ABEL

NOW ABEL WAS A KEEPER OF SHEEP AND CAIN A WORKER OF THE GROUND

IN THE COURSE OF TIME CAIN BROUGHT TO THE LORD AN OFFERING OF THE FRUIT OF THE GROUND AND ABEL ALSO BROUGHT OF THE FIRSTBORN OF HIS FLOCK AND OF THEIR FAT PORTIONS

AND THE LORD HAD REGARD FOR ABEL AND HIS OFFERING BUT FOR CAIN AND HIS OFFERING HE HAD NO REGARD

SO CAIN WAS VERY ANGRY AND HIS FACE FELL

THE LORD SAID TO CAIN WHY ARE YOU ANGRY AND WHY HAS YOUR FACE FALLEN

IF YOU DO WELL WILL YOU NOT BE ACCEPTED

AND IF YOU DO NOT DO WELL SIN IS CROUCHING AT THE DOOR

ITS DESIRE IS FOR YOU BUT YOU MUST RULE OVER IT

 CAIN SPOKE TO ABEL HIS BROTHER

AND WHEN THEY WERE IN THE FIELD CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST HIS BROTHER ABEL AND KILLED HIM

THEN THE LORD SAID TO CAIN WHERE IS ABEL YOUR BROTHER

 HE SAID I DO NOT KNOW; AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER

 AND THE LORD SAID WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

THE VOICE OF YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD IS CRYING TO ME FROM THE GROUND

AND NOW YOU ARE CURSED FROM THE GROUND WHICH HAS OPENED ITS MOUTH TO RECEIVE YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD FROM YOUR HAND

WHEN YOU WORK THE GROUND IT SHALL NO LONGER YIELD TO YOU ITS STRENGTH

YOU SHALL BE A FUGITIVE AND A WANDERER ON THE EARTH

 CAIN SAID TO THE LORD MY PUNISHMENT IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR

BEHOLD YOU HAVE DRIVEN ME TODAY AWAY FROM THE GROUND AND FROM YOUR FACE I SHALL BE HIDDEN

I SHALL BE A FUGITIVE AND A WANDERER ON THE EARTH AND WHOEVER FINDS ME WILL KILL ME

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO HIM NOT SO

IF ANYONE KILLS CAIN VENGEANCE SHALL BE TAKEN ON HIM SEVENFOLD

 AND THE LORD PUT A MARK ON CAIN LEST ANY WHO FOUND HIM SHOULD ATTACK HIM

THEN CAIN WENT AWAY FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND SETTLED IN THE LAND OF NOD EAST OF EDEN

CAIN KNEW HIS WIFE AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE ENOCH

WHEN HE BUILT A CITY HE CALLED THE NAME OF THE CITY AFTER THE NAME OF HIS SON ENOCH

TO ENOCH WAS BORN IRAD AND IRAD FATHERED MEHUJAEL AND MEHUJAEL FATHERED METHUSHAEL AND METHUSHAEL FATHERED LAMECH

AND LAMECH TOOK TWO WIVES

THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ADAH AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER ZILLAH

ADAH BORE JABAL; HE WAS THE FATHER OF THOSE WHO DWELL IN TENTS AND HAVE LIVESTOCK

HIS BROTHER'S NAME WAS JUBAL; HE WAS THE FATHER OF ALL THOSE WHO PLAY THE LYRE AND PIPE

ZILLAH ALSO BORE TUBALCAIN; HE WAS THE FORGER OF ALL INSTRUMENTS OF BRONZE AND IRON

THE SISTER OF TUBALCAIN WAS NAAMAH

LAMECH SAID TO HIS WIVES ADAH AND ZILLAH HEAR MY VOICE; YOU WIVES OF LAMECH LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY I HAVE KILLED A MAN FOR WOUNDING ME A YOUNG MAN FOR STRIKING ME

IF CAIN'S REVENGE IS SEVENFOLD THEN LAMECH'S IS SEVENTYSEVENFOLD

 AND ADAM KNEW HIS WIFE AGAIN AND SHE BORE A SON AND CALLED HIS NAME SETH FOR SHE SAID GOD HAS APPOINTED FOR ME ANOTHER OFFSPRING INSTEAD OF ABEL FOR CAIN KILLED HIM

 TO SETH ALSO A SON WAS BORN AND HE CALLED HIS NAME ENOSH

AT THAT TIME PEOPLE BEGAN TO CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD

THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM

WHEN GOD CREATED MAN HE MADE HIM IN THE LIKENESS OF GOD

MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM AND HE BLESSED THEM AND NAMED THEM MAN WHEN THEY WERE CREATED

WHEN ADAM HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED A SON IN HIS OWN LIKENESS AFTER HIS IMAGE AND NAMED HIM SETH

THE DAYS OF ADAM AFTER HE FATHERED SETH WERE  YEARS; AND HE HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS THAT ADAM LIVED WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN SETH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED ENOSH

SETH LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED ENOSH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF SETH WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN ENOSH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED KENAN

ENOSH LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED KENAN  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF ENOSH WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN KENAN HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED MAHALALEL

KENAN LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED MAHALALEL  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF KENAN WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN MAHALALEL HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED JARED

MAHALALEL LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED JARED  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF MAHALALEL WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN JARED HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED ENOCH

JARED LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED ENOCH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF JARED WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN ENOCH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED METHUSELAH

ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD AFTER HE FATHERED METHUSELAH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF ENOCH WERE  YEARS

ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD AND HE WAS NOT FOR GOD TOOK HIM

WHEN METHUSELAH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED LAMECH

METHUSELAH LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED LAMECH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF METHUSELAH WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

WHEN LAMECH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED A SON AND CALLED HIS NAME NOAH SAYING OUT OF THE GROUND THAT THE LORD HAS CURSED THIS ONE SHALL BRING US RELIEF FROM OUR WORK AND FROM THE PAINFUL TOIL OF OUR HANDS

 LAMECH LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED NOAH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THUS ALL THE DAYS OF LAMECH WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

AFTER NOAH WAS  YEARS OLD NOAH FATHERED SHEM HAM AND JAPHETH

WHEN MAN BEGAN TO MULTIPLY ON THE FACE OF THE LAND AND DAUGHTERS WERE BORN TO THEM THE SONS OF GOD SAW THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF MAN WERE ATTRACTIVE

AND THEY TOOK AS THEIR WIVES ANY THEY CHOSE

THEN THE LORD SAID MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT ABIDE IN MAN FOREVER FOR HE IS FLESH HIS DAYS SHALL BE  YEARS

 THE NEPHILIM WERE ON THE EARTH IN THOSE DAYS AND ALSO AFTERWARD WHEN THE SONS OF GOD CAME IN TO THE DAUGHTERS OF MAN AND THEY BORE CHILDREN TO THEM

THESE WERE THE MIGHTY MEN WHO WERE OF OLD THE MEN OF RENOWN

THE LORD SAW THAT THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS GREAT IN THE EARTH AND THAT EVERY INTENTION OF THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART WAS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY

AND THE LORD WAS SORRY THAT HE HAD MADE MAN ON THE EARTH AND IT GRIEVED HIM TO HIS HEART

SO THE LORD SAID I WILL BLOT OUT MAN WHOM I HAVE CREATED FROM THE FACE OF THE LAND MAN AND ANIMALS AND CREEPING THINGS AND BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS FOR I AM SORRY THAT I HAVE MADE THEM

 BUT NOAH FOUND FAVOR IN THE EYES OF THE LORD

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH

NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN BLAMELESS IN HIS GENERATION

NOAH WALKED WITH GOD

AND NOAH HAD THREE SONS SHEM HAM AND JAPHETH

NOW THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT IN GOD'S SIGHT AND THE EARTH WAS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE

AND GOD SAW THE EARTH AND BEHOLD IT WAS CORRUPT FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED THEIR WAY ON THE EARTH

AND GOD SAID TO NOAH I HAVE DETERMINED TO MAKE AN END OF ALL FLESH FOR THE EARTH IS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE THROUGH THEM

BEHOLD I WILL DESTROY THEM WITH THE EARTH

MAKE YOURSELF AN ARK OF GOPHER WOOD

MAKE ROOMS IN THE ARK AND COVER IT INSIDE AND OUT WITH PITCH

THIS IS HOW YOU ARE TO MAKE IT THE LENGTH OF THE ARK  CUBITS ITS BREADTH  CUBITS AND ITS HEIGHT  CUBITS

MAKE A ROOF FOR THE ARK AND FINISH IT TO A CUBIT ABOVE AND SET THE DOOR OF THE ARK IN ITS SIDE

MAKE IT WITH LOWER SECOND AND THIRD DECKS

FOR BEHOLD I WILL BRING A FLOOD OF WATERS UPON THE EARTH TO DESTROY ALL FLESH IN WHICH IS THE BREATH OF LIFE UNDER HEAVEN

EVERYTHING THAT IS ON THE EARTH SHALL DIE

BUT I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL COME INTO THE ARK YOU YOUR SONS YOUR WIFE AND YOUR SONS' WIVES WITH YOU

AND OF EVERY LIVING THING OF ALL FLESH YOU SHALL BRING TWO OF EVERY SORT INTO THE ARK TO KEEP THEM ALIVE WITH YOU

THEY SHALL BE MALE AND FEMALE

OF THE BIRDS ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS AND OF THE ANIMALS ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS OF EVERY CREEPING THING OF THE GROUND ACCORDING TO ITS KIND TWO OF EVERY SORT SHALL COME IN TO YOU TO KEEP THEM ALIVE

ALSO TAKE WITH YOU EVERY SORT OF FOOD THAT IS EATEN AND STORE IT UP

IT SHALL SERVE AS FOOD FOR YOU AND FOR THEM

 NOAH DID THIS; HE DID ALL THAT GOD COMMANDED HIM

THEN THE LORD SAID TO NOAH GO INTO THE ARK YOU AND ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD FOR I HAVE SEEN THAT YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS BEFORE ME IN THIS GENERATION

TAKE WITH YOU SEVEN PAIRS OF ALL CLEAN ANIMALS THE MALE AND HIS MATE AND A PAIR OF THE ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT CLEAN THE MALE AND HIS MATE AND SEVEN PAIRS OF THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS ALSO MALE AND FEMALE TO KEEP THEIR OFFSPRING ALIVE ON THE FACE OF ALL THE EARTH

FOR IN SEVEN DAYS I WILL SEND RAIN ON THE EARTH FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS AND EVERY LIVING THING THAT I HAVE MADE I WILL BLOT OUT FROM THE FACE OF THE GROUND

 AND NOAH DID ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED HIM

NOAH WAS SIX HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN THE FLOOD OF WATERS CAME UPON THE EARTH

AND NOAH AND HIS SONS AND HIS WIFE AND HIS SONS' WIVES WITH HIM WENT INTO THE ARK TO ESCAPE THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD

OF CLEAN ANIMALS AND OF ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT CLEAN AND OF BIRDS AND OF EVERYTHING THAT CREEPS ON THE GROUND TWO AND TWO MALE AND FEMALE WENT INTO THE ARK WITH NOAH AS GOD HAD COMMANDED NOAH

AND AFTER SEVEN DAYS THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD CAME UPON THE EARTH

IN THE SIX HUNDREDTH YEAR OF NOAH'S LIFE IN THE SECOND MONTH ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH ON THAT DAY ALL THE FOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT DEEP BURST FORTH AND THE WINDOWS OF THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED

AND RAIN FELL UPON THE EARTH FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS

ON THE VERY SAME DAY NOAH AND HIS SONS SHEM AND HAM AND JAPHETH AND NOAH'S WIFE AND THE THREE WIVES OF HIS SONS WITH THEM ENTERED THE ARK THEY AND EVERY BEAST ACCORDING TO ITS KIND AND ALL THE LIVESTOCK ACCORDING TO THEIR KINDS AND EVERY CREEPING THING THAT CREEPS ON THE EARTH ACCORDING TO ITS KIND AND EVERY BIRD ACCORDING TO ITS KIND EVERY WINGED CREATURE

THEY WENT INTO THE ARK WITH NOAH TWO AND TWO OF ALL FLESH IN WHICH THERE WAS THE BREATH OF LIFE

AND THOSE THAT ENTERED MALE AND FEMALE OF ALL FLESH WENT IN AS GOD HAD COMMANDED HIM

AND THE LORD SHUT HIM IN

THE FLOOD CONTINUED FORTY DAYS ON THE EARTH

THE WATERS INCREASED AND BORE UP THE ARK AND IT ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH

THE WATERS PREVAILED AND INCREASED GREATLY ON THE EARTH AND THE ARK FLOATED ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS

AND THE WATERS PREVAILED SO MIGHTILY ON THE EARTH THAT ALL THE HIGH MOUNTAINS UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN WERE COVERED

THE WATERS PREVAILED ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS COVERING THEM FIFTEEN CUBITS DEEP

AND ALL FLESH DIED THAT MOVED ON THE EARTH BIRDS LIVESTOCK BEASTS ALL SWARMING CREATURES THAT SWARM ON THE EARTH AND ALL MANKIND

EVERYTHING ON THE DRY LAND IN WHOSE NOSTRILS WAS THE BREATH OF LIFE DIED

HE BLOTTED OUT EVERY LIVING THING THAT WAS ON THE FACE OF THE GROUND MAN AND ANIMALS AND CREEPING THINGS AND BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS

THEY WERE BLOTTED OUT FROM THE EARTH

ONLY NOAH WAS LEFT AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM IN THE ARK

AND THE WATERS PREVAILED ON THE EARTH  DAYS

BUT GOD REMEMBERED NOAH AND ALL THE BEASTS AND ALL THE LIVESTOCK THAT WERE WITH HIM IN THE ARK

AND GOD MADE A WIND BLOW OVER THE EARTH AND THE WATERS SUBSIDED

THE FOUNTAINS OF THE DEEP AND THE WINDOWS OF THE HEAVENS WERE CLOSED THE RAIN FROM THE HEAVENS WAS RESTRAINED AND THE WATERS RECEDED FROM THE EARTH CONTINUALLY

AT THE END OF  DAYS THE WATERS HAD ABATED AND IN THE SEVENTH MONTH ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH THE ARK CAME TO REST ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ARARAT

AND THE WATERS CONTINUED TO ABATE UNTIL THE TENTH MONTH; IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE SEEN

AT THE END OF FORTY DAYS NOAH OPENED THE WINDOW OF THE ARK THAT HE HAD MADE AND SENT FORTH A RAVEN

IT WENT TO AND FRO UNTIL THE WATERS WERE DRIED UP FROM THE EARTH

THEN HE SENT FORTH A DOVE FROM HIM TO SEE IF THE WATERS HAD SUBSIDED FROM THE FACE OF THE GROUND

BUT THE DOVE FOUND NO PLACE TO SET HER FOOT AND SHE RETURNED TO HIM TO THE ARK FOR THE WATERS WERE STILL ON THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH

SO HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK HER AND BROUGHT HER INTO THE ARK WITH HIM

HE WAITED ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS AND AGAIN HE SENT FORTH THE DOVE OUT OF THE ARK

AND THE DOVE CAME BACK TO HIM IN THE EVENING AND BEHOLD IN HER MOUTH WAS A FRESHLY PLUCKED OLIVE LEAF

SO NOAH KNEW THAT THE WATERS HAD SUBSIDED FROM THE EARTH

THEN HE WAITED ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS AND SENT FORTH THE DOVE AND SHE DID NOT RETURN TO HIM ANYMORE

IN THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIRST YEAR IN THE FIRST MONTH THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE WATERS WERE DRIED FROM OFF THE EARTH

AND NOAH REMOVED THE COVERING OF THE ARK AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE FACE OF THE GROUND WAS DRY

IN THE SECOND MONTH ON THE TWENTYSEVENTH DAY OF THE MONTH THE EARTH HAD DRIED OUT

THEN GOD SAID TO NOAH GO OUT FROM THE ARK YOU AND YOUR WIFE AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR SONS' WIVES WITH YOU

BRING OUT WITH YOU EVERY LIVING THING THAT IS WITH YOU OF ALL FLESHBIRDS AND ANIMALS AND EVERY CREEPING THING THAT CREEPS ON THE EARTHTHAT THEY MAY SWARM ON THE EARTH AND BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY ON THE EARTH

 SO NOAH WENT OUT AND HIS SONS AND HIS WIFE AND HIS SONS' WIVES WITH HIM

EVERY BEAST EVERY CREEPING THING AND EVERY BIRD EVERYTHING THAT MOVES ON THE EARTH WENT OUT BY FAMILIES FROM THE ARK

THEN NOAH BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD AND TOOK SOME OF EVERY CLEAN ANIMAL AND SOME OF EVERY CLEAN BIRD AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS ON THE ALTAR

AND WHEN THE LORD SMELLED THE PLEASING AROMA THE LORD SAID IN HIS HEART I WILL NEVER AGAIN CURSE THE GROUND BECAUSE OF MAN FOR THE INTENTION OF MAN'S HEART IS EVIL FROM HIS YOUTH

NEITHER WILL I EVER AGAIN STRIKE DOWN EVERY LIVING CREATURE AS I HAVE DONE

WHILE THE EARTH REMAINS SEEDTIME AND HARVEST COLD AND HEAT SUMMER AND WINTER DAY AND NIGHT SHALL NOT CEASE

AND GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS SONS AND SAID TO THEM BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND FILL THE EARTH

THE FEAR OF YOU AND THE DREAD OF YOU SHALL BE UPON EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH AND UPON EVERY BIRD OF THE HEAVENS UPON EVERYTHING THAT CREEPS ON THE GROUND AND ALL THE FISH OF THE SEA

INTO YOUR HAND THEY ARE DELIVERED

EVERY MOVING THING THAT LIVES SHALL BE FOOD FOR YOU

AND AS I GAVE YOU THE GREEN PLANTS I GIVE YOU EVERYTHING

BUT YOU SHALL NOT EAT FLESH WITH ITS LIFE THAT IS ITS BLOOD

AND FOR YOUR LIFEBLOOD I WILL REQUIRE A RECKONING FROM EVERY BEAST I WILL REQUIRE IT AND FROM MAN

FROM HIS FELLOW MAN I WILL REQUIRE A RECKONING FOR THE LIFE OF MAN

WHOEVER SHEDS THE BLOOD OF MAN BY MAN SHALL HIS BLOOD BE SHED FOR GOD MADE MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE

AND YOU BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY TEEM ON THE EARTH AND MULTIPLY IN IT

 THEN GOD SAID TO NOAH AND TO HIS SONS WITH HIM BEHOLD I ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU AND WITH EVERY LIVING CREATURE THAT IS WITH YOU THE BIRDS THE LIVESTOCK AND EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH WITH YOU AS MANY AS CAME OUT OF THE ARK; IT IS FOR EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH

I ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL ALL FLESH BE CUT OFF BY THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD AND NEVER AGAIN SHALL THERE BE A FLOOD TO DESTROY THE EARTH

 AND GOD SAID THIS IS THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT THAT I MAKE BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND EVERY LIVING CREATURE THAT IS WITH YOU FOR ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS I HAVE SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUD AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN OF THE COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND THE EARTH

WHEN I BRING CLOUDS OVER THE EARTH AND THE BOW IS SEEN IN THE CLOUDS I WILL REMEMBER MY COVENANT THAT IS BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND EVERY LIVING CREATURE OF ALL FLESH

AND THE WATERS SHALL NEVER AGAIN BECOME A FLOOD TO DESTROY ALL FLESH

WHEN THE BOW IS IN THE CLOUDS I WILL SEE IT AND REMEMBER THE EVERLASTING COVENANT BETWEEN GOD AND EVERY LIVING CREATURE OF ALL FLESH THAT IS ON THE EARTH

 GOD SAID TO NOAH THIS IS THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT THAT I HAVE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN ME AND ALL FLESH THAT IS ON THE EARTH

 THE SONS OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE SHEM HAM AND JAPHETH

HAM WAS THE FATHER OF CANAAN

 THESE THREE WERE THE SONS OF NOAH AND FROM THESE THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE EARTH WERE DISPERSED

NOAH BEGAN TO BE A MAN OF THE SOIL AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD

HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK AND LAY UNCOVERED IN HIS TENT

AND HAM THE FATHER OF CANAAN SAW THE NAKEDNESS OF HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIS TWO BROTHERS OUTSIDE

THEN SHEM AND JAPHETH TOOK A GARMENT LAID IT ON BOTH THEIR SHOULDERS AND WALKED BACKWARD AND COVERED THE NAKEDNESS OF THEIR FATHER

THEIR FACES WERE TURNED BACKWARD AND THEY DID NOT SEE THEIR FATHER'S NAKEDNESS

WHEN NOAH AWOKE FROM HIS WINE AND KNEW WHAT HIS YOUNGEST SON HAD DONE TO HIM HE SAID CURSED BE CANAAN; A SERVANT OF SERVANTS SHALL HE BE TO HIS BROTHERS

 HE ALSO SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF SHEM; AND LET CANAAN BE HIS SERVANT

MAY GOD ENLARGE JAPHETH AND LET HIM DWELL IN THE TENTS OF SHEM AND LET CANAAN BE HIS SERVANT

 AFTER THE FLOOD NOAH LIVED  YEARS

ALL THE DAYS OF NOAH WERE  YEARS AND HE DIED

CUSH FATHERED NIMROD; HE WAS THE FIRST ON EARTH TO BE A MIGHTY MAN

HE WAS A MIGHTY HUNTER BEFORE THE LORD

THEREFORE IT IS SAID LIKE NIMROD A MIGHTY HUNTER BEFORE THE LORD

 THE BEGINNING OF HIS KINGDOM WAS BABEL ERECH ACCAD AND CALNEH IN THE LAND OF SHINAR

FROM THAT LAND HE WENT INTO ASSYRIA AND BUILT NINEVEH REHOBOTHIR CALAH AND RESEN BETWEEN NINEVEH AND CALAH; THAT IS THE GREAT CITY

EGYPT FATHERED LUDIM ANAMIM LEHABIM NAPHTUHIM PATHRUSIM CASLUHIM FROM WHOM THE PHILISTINES CAME AND CAPHTORIM

CANAAN FATHERED SIDON HIS FIRSTBORN AND HETH AND THE JEBUSITES THE AMORITES THE GIRGASHITES THE HIVITES THE ARKITES THE SINITES THE ARVADITES THE ZEMARITES AND THE HAMATHITES

AFTERWARD THE CLANS OF THE CANAANITES DISPERSED

AND THE TERRITORY OF THE CANAANITES EXTENDED FROM SIDON IN THE DIRECTION OF GERAR AS FAR AS GAZA AND IN THE DIRECTION OF SODOM GOMORRAH ADMAH AND ZEBOIIM AS FAR AS LASHA

THESE ARE THE SONS OF HAM BY THEIR CLANS THEIR LANGUAGES THEIR LANDS AND THEIR NATIONS

TO SHEM ALSO THE FATHER OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF EBER THE ELDER BROTHER OF JAPHETH CHILDREN WERE BORN

THE SONS OF SHEM ELAM ASSHUR ARPACHSHAD LUD AND ARAM

THE SONS OF ARAM UZ HUL GETHER AND MASH

ARPACHSHAD FATHERED SHELAH; AND SHELAH FATHERED EBER

TO EBER WERE BORN TWO SONS THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS PELEG FOR IN HIS DAYS THE EARTH WAS DIVIDED AND HIS BROTHER'S NAME WAS JOKTAN

JOKTAN FATHERED ALMODAD SHELEPH HAZARMAVETH JERAH HADORAM UZAL DIKLAH OBAL ABIMAEL SHEBA OPHIR HAVILAH AND JOBAB; ALL THESE WERE THE SONS OF JOKTAN

THE TERRITORY IN WHICH THEY LIVED EXTENDED FROM MESHA IN THE DIRECTION OF SEPHAR TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE EAST

THESE ARE THE SONS OF SHEM BY THEIR CLANS THEIR LANGUAGES THEIR LANDS AND THEIR NATIONS

THESE ARE THE CLANS OF THE SONS OF NOAH ACCORDING TO THEIR GENEALOGIES IN THEIR NATIONS AND FROM THESE THE NATIONS SPREAD ABROAD ON THE EARTH AFTER THE FLOOD

NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS

AND AS PEOPLE MIGRATED FROM THE EAST THEY FOUND A PLAIN IN THE LAND OF SHINAR AND SETTLED THERE

AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER COME LET US MAKE BRICKS AND BURN THEM THOROUGHLY

 AND THEY HAD BRICK FOR STONE AND BITUMEN FOR MORTAR

THEN THEY SAID COME LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY AND A TOWER WITH ITS TOP IN THE HEAVENS AND LET US MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELVES LEST WE BE DISPERSED OVER THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH

 AND THE LORD CAME DOWN TO SEE THE CITY AND THE TOWER WHICH THE CHILDREN OF MAN HAD BUILT

AND THE LORD SAID BEHOLD THEY ARE ONE PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE ALL ONE LANGUAGE AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THEY WILL DO

AND NOTHING THAT THEY PROPOSE TO DO WILL NOW BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM

COME LET US GO DOWN AND THERE CONFUSE THEIR LANGUAGE SO THAT THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER'S SPEECH

 SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM FROM THERE OVER THE FACE OF ALL THE EARTH AND THEY LEFT OFF BUILDING THE CITY

THEREFORE ITS NAME WAS CALLED BABEL BECAUSE THERE THE LORD CONFUSED THE LANGUAGE OF ALL THE EARTH

AND FROM THERE THE LORD DISPERSED THEM OVER THE FACE OF ALL THE EARTH

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF SHEM

WHEN SHEM WAS  YEARS OLD HE FATHERED ARPACHSHAD TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD

AND SHEM LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED ARPACHSHAD  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN ARPACHSHAD HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED SHELAH

AND ARPACHSHAD LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED SHELAH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN SHELAH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED EBER

AND SHELAH LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED EBER  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN EBER HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED PELEG

AND EBER LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED PELEG  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN PELEG HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED REU

AND PELEG LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED REU  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN REU HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED SERUG

AND REU LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED SERUG  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN SERUG HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED NAHOR

AND SERUG LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED NAHOR  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN NAHOR HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED TERAH

AND NAHOR LIVED AFTER HE FATHERED TERAH  YEARS AND HAD OTHER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

WHEN TERAH HAD LIVED  YEARS HE FATHERED ABRAM NAHOR AND HARAN

NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF TERAH

TERAH FATHERED ABRAM NAHOR AND HARAN; AND HARAN FATHERED LOT

HARAN DIED IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FATHER TERAH IN THE LAND OF HIS KINDRED IN UR OF THE CHALDEANS

AND ABRAM AND NAHOR TOOK WIVES

THE NAME OF ABRAM'S WIFE WAS SARAI AND THE NAME OF NAHOR'S WIFE MILCAH THE DAUGHTER OF HARAN THE FATHER OF MILCAH AND ISCAH

NOW SARAI WAS BARREN; SHE HAD NO CHILD

TERAH TOOK ABRAM HIS SON AND LOT THE SON OF HARAN HIS GRANDSON AND SARAI HIS DAUGHTERINLAW HIS SON ABRAM'S WIFE AND THEY WENT FORTH TOGETHER FROM UR OF THE CHALDEANS TO GO INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO HARAN THEY SETTLED THERE

THE DAYS OF TERAH WERE  YEARS AND TERAH DIED IN HARAN

NOW THE LORD SAID TO ABRAM GO FROM YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR KINDRED AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE TO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU

AND I WILL MAKE OF YOU A GREAT NATION AND I WILL BLESS YOU AND MAKE YOUR NAME GREAT SO THAT YOU WILL BE A BLESSING

I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU AND HIM WHO DISHONORS YOU I WILL CURSE AND IN YOU ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED

 SO ABRAM WENT AS THE LORD HAD TOLD HIM AND LOT WENT WITH HIM

ABRAM WAS SEVENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE DEPARTED FROM HARAN

AND ABRAM TOOK SARAI HIS WIFE AND LOT HIS BROTHER'S SON AND ALL THEIR POSSESSIONS THAT THEY HAD GATHERED AND THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD ACQUIRED IN HARAN AND THEY SET OUT TO GO TO THE LAND OF CANAAN

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE LAND OF CANAAN ABRAM PASSED THROUGH THE LAND TO THE PLACE AT SHECHEM TO THE OAK OF MOREH

AT THAT TIME THE CANAANITES WERE IN THE LAND

THEN THE LORD APPEARED TO ABRAM AND SAID TO YOUR OFFSPRING I WILL GIVE THIS LAND

 SO HE BUILT THERE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD WHO HAD APPEARED TO HIM

FROM THERE HE MOVED TO THE HILL COUNTRY ON THE EAST OF BETHEL AND PITCHED HIS TENT WITH BETHEL ON THE WEST AND AI ON THE EAST

AND THERE HE BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD AND CALLED UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND ABRAM JOURNEYED ON STILL GOING TOWARD THE NEGEB

NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND

SO ABRAM WENT DOWN TO EGYPT TO SOJOURN THERE FOR THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN THE LAND

WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO ENTER EGYPT HE SAID TO SARAI HIS WIFE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL IN APPEARANCE AND WHEN THE EGYPTIANS SEE YOU THEY WILL SAY 'THIS IS HIS WIFE

' THEN THEY WILL KILL ME BUT THEY WILL LET YOU LIVE

SAY YOU ARE MY SISTER THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU AND THAT MY LIFE MAY BE SPARED FOR YOUR SAKE

 WHEN ABRAM ENTERED EGYPT THE EGYPTIANS SAW THAT THE WOMAN WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL

AND WHEN THE PRINCES OF PHARAOH SAW HER THEY PRAISED HER TO PHARAOH

AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN INTO PHARAOH'S HOUSE

AND FOR HER SAKE HE DEALT WELL WITH ABRAM; AND HE HAD SHEEP OXEN MALE DONKEYS MALE SERVANTS FEMALE SERVANTS FEMALE DONKEYS AND CAMELS

BUT THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH AND HIS HOUSE WITH GREAT PLAGUES BECAUSE OF SARAI ABRAM'S WIFE

SO PHARAOH CALLED ABRAM AND SAID WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE TO ME

WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT SHE WAS YOUR WIFE

WHY DID YOU SAY 'SHE IS MY SISTER' SO THAT I TOOK HER FOR MY WIFE

NOW THEN HERE IS YOUR WIFE; TAKE HER AND GO

 AND PHARAOH GAVE MEN ORDERS CONCERNING HIM AND THEY SENT HIM AWAY WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL THAT HE HAD

SO ABRAM WENT UP FROM EGYPT HE AND HIS WIFE AND ALL THAT HE HAD AND LOT WITH HIM INTO THE NEGEB

NOW ABRAM WAS VERY RICH IN LIVESTOCK IN SILVER AND IN GOLD

AND HE JOURNEYED ON FROM THE NEGEB AS FAR AS BETHEL TO THE PLACE WHERE HIS TENT HAD BEEN AT THE BEGINNING BETWEEN BETHEL AND AI TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD MADE AN ALTAR AT THE FIRST

AND THERE ABRAM CALLED UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND LOT WHO WENT WITH ABRAM ALSO HAD FLOCKS AND HERDS AND TENTS SO THAT THE LAND COULD NOT SUPPORT BOTH OF THEM DWELLING TOGETHER; FOR THEIR POSSESSIONS WERE SO GREAT THAT THEY COULD NOT DWELL TOGETHER AND THERE WAS STRIFE BETWEEN THE HERDSMEN OF ABRAM'S LIVESTOCK AND THE HERDSMEN OF LOT'S LIVESTOCK

AT THAT TIME THE CANAANITES AND THE PERIZZITES WERE DWELLING IN THE LAND

THEN ABRAM SAID TO LOT LET THERE BE NO STRIFE BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND BETWEEN YOUR HERDSMEN AND MY HERDSMEN FOR WE ARE KINSMEN

IS NOT THE WHOLE LAND BEFORE YOU

SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM ME

IF YOU TAKE THE LEFT HAND THEN I WILL GO TO THE RIGHT OR IF YOU TAKE THE RIGHT HAND THEN I WILL GO TO THE LEFT

 AND LOT LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW THAT THE JORDAN VALLEY WAS WELL WATERED EVERYWHERE LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD LIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE DIRECTION OF ZOAR

THIS WAS BEFORE THE LORD DESTROYED SODOM AND GOMORRAH

 SO LOT CHOSE FOR HIMSELF ALL THE JORDAN VALLEY AND LOT JOURNEYED EAST

THUS THEY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER

ABRAM SETTLED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN WHILE LOT SETTLED AMONG THE CITIES OF THE VALLEY AND MOVED HIS TENT AS FAR AS SODOM

NOW THE MEN OF SODOM WERE WICKED GREAT SINNERS AGAINST THE LORD

THE LORD SAID TO ABRAM AFTER LOT HAD SEPARATED FROM HIM LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND LOOK FROM THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD AND WESTWARD FOR ALL THE LAND THAT YOU SEE I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING FOREVER

I WILL MAKE YOUR OFFSPRING AS THE DUST OF THE EARTH SO THAT IF ONE CAN COUNT THE DUST OF THE EARTH YOUR OFFSPRING ALSO CAN BE COUNTED

ARISE WALK THROUGH THE LENGTH AND THE BREADTH OF THE LAND FOR I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU

 SO ABRAM MOVED HIS TENT AND CAME AND SETTLED BY THE OAKS OF MAMRE WHICH ARE AT HEBRON AND THERE HE BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD

IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL KING OF SHINAR ARIOCH KING OF ELLASAR CHEDORLAOMER KING OF ELAM AND TIDAL KING OF GOIIM THESE KINGS MADE WAR WITH BERA KING OF SODOM BIRSHA KING OF GOMORRAH SHINAB KING OF ADMAH SHEMEBER KING OF ZEBOIIM AND THE KING OF BELA THAT IS ZOAR

AND ALL THESE JOINED FORCES IN THE VALLEY OF SIDDIM THAT IS THE SALT SEA

TWELVE YEARS THEY HAD SERVED CHEDORLAOMER BUT IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR THEY REBELLED

IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR CHEDORLAOMER AND THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM CAME AND DEFEATED THE REPHAIM IN ASHTEROTHKARNAIM THE ZUZIM IN HAM THE EMIM IN SHAVEHKIRIATHAIM AND THE HORITES IN THEIR HILL COUNTRY OF SEIR AS FAR AS ELPARAN ON THE BORDER OF THE WILDERNESS

THEN THEY TURNED BACK AND CAME TO ENMISHPAT THAT IS KADESH AND DEFEATED ALL THE COUNTRY OF THE AMALEKITES AND ALSO THE AMORITES WHO WERE DWELLING IN HAZAZONTAMAR

THEN THE KING OF SODOM THE KING OF GOMORRAH THE KING OF ADMAH THE KING OF ZEBOIIM AND THE KING OF BELA THAT IS ZOAR WENT OUT AND THEY JOINED BATTLE IN THE VALLEY OF SIDDIM WITH CHEDORLAOMER KING OF ELAM TIDAL KING OF GOIIM AMRAPHEL KING OF SHINAR AND ARIOCH KING OF ELLASAR FOUR KINGS AGAINST FIVE

NOW THE VALLEY OF SIDDIM WAS FULL OF BITUMEN PITS AND AS THE KINGS OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH FLED SOME FELL INTO THEM AND THE REST FLED TO THE HILL COUNTRY

SO THE ENEMY TOOK ALL THE POSSESSIONS OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND ALL THEIR PROVISIONS AND WENT THEIR WAY

THEY ALSO TOOK LOT THE SON OF ABRAM'S BROTHER WHO WAS DWELLING IN SODOM AND HIS POSSESSIONS AND WENT THEIR WAY

THEN ONE WHO HAD ESCAPED CAME AND TOLD ABRAM THE HEBREW WHO WAS LIVING BY THE OAKS OF MAMRE THE AMORITE BROTHER OF ESHCOL AND OF ANER

THESE WERE ALLIES OF ABRAM

WHEN ABRAM HEARD THAT HIS KINSMAN HAD BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE HE LED FORTH HIS TRAINED MEN BORN IN HIS HOUSE  OF THEM AND WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS DAN

AND HE DIVIDED HIS FORCES AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT HE AND HIS SERVANTS AND DEFEATED THEM AND PURSUED THEM TO HOBAH NORTH OF DAMASCUS

THEN HE BROUGHT BACK ALL THE POSSESSIONS AND ALSO BROUGHT BACK HIS KINSMAN LOT WITH HIS POSSESSIONS AND THE WOMEN AND THE PEOPLE

AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE DEFEAT OF CHEDORLAOMER AND THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM THE KING OF SODOM WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AT THE VALLEY OF SHAVEH THAT IS THE KING'S VALLEY

AND MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM BROUGHT OUT BREAD AND WINE

HE WAS PRIEST OF GOD MOST HIGH

 AND HE BLESSED HIM AND SAID BLESSED BE ABRAM BY GOD MOST HIGH POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH; AND BLESSED BE GOD MOST HIGH WHO HAS DELIVERED YOUR ENEMIES INTO YOUR HAND

AND ABRAM GAVE HIM A TENTH OF EVERYTHING

AND THE KING OF SODOM SAID TO ABRAM GIVE ME THE PERSONS BUT TAKE THE GOODS FOR YOURSELF

 BUT ABRAM SAID TO THE KING OF SODOM I HAVE LIFTED MY HAND TO THE LORD GOD MOST HIGH POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT I WOULD NOT TAKE A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP OR ANYTHING THAT IS YOURS LEST YOU SHOULD SAY 'I HAVE MADE ABRAM RICH

' I WILL TAKE NOTHING BUT WHAT THE YOUNG MEN HAVE EATEN AND THE SHARE OF THE MEN WHO WENT WITH ME

LET ANER ESHCOL AND MAMRE TAKE THEIR SHARE

AFTER THESE THINGS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ABRAM IN A VISION FEAR NOT ABRAM I AM YOUR SHIELD; YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT

 BUT ABRAM SAID O LORD GOD WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR I CONTINUE CHILDLESS AND THE HEIR OF MY HOUSE IS ELIEZER OF DAMASCUS

 AND ABRAM SAID BEHOLD YOU HAVE GIVEN ME NO OFFSPRING AND A MEMBER OF MY HOUSEHOLD WILL BE MY HEIR

 AND BEHOLD THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO HIM THIS MAN SHALL NOT BE YOUR HEIR; YOUR VERY OWN SON SHALL BE YOUR HEIR

 AND HE BROUGHT HIM OUTSIDE AND SAID LOOK TOWARD HEAVEN AND NUMBER THE STARS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO NUMBER THEM

 THEN HE SAID TO HIM SO SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING BE

 AND HE BELIEVED THE LORD AND HE COUNTED IT TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS

AND HE SAID TO HIM I AM THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM UR OF THE CHALDEANS TO GIVE YOU THIS LAND TO POSSESS

 BUT HE SAID O LORD GOD HOW AM I TO KNOW THAT I SHALL POSSESS IT

 HE SAID TO HIM BRING ME A HEIFER THREE YEARS OLD A FEMALE GOAT THREE YEARS OLD A RAM THREE YEARS OLD A TURTLEDOVE AND A YOUNG PIGEON

 AND HE BROUGHT HIM ALL THESE CUT THEM IN HALF AND LAID EACH HALF OVER AGAINST THE OTHER

BUT HE DID NOT CUT THE BIRDS IN HALF

AND WHEN BIRDS OF PREY CAME DOWN ON THE CARCASSES ABRAM DROVE THEM AWAY

AS THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN A DEEP SLEEP FELL ON ABRAM

AND BEHOLD DREADFUL AND GREAT DARKNESS FELL UPON HIM

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ABRAM KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOUR OFFSPRING WILL BE SOJOURNERS IN A LAND THAT IS NOT THEIRS AND WILL BE SERVANTS THERE AND THEY WILL BE AFFLICTED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS

BUT I WILL BRING JUDGMENT ON THE NATION THAT THEY SERVE AND AFTERWARD THEY SHALL COME OUT WITH GREAT POSSESSIONS

AS FOR YOURSELF YOU SHALL GO TO YOUR FATHERS IN PEACE; YOU SHALL BE BURIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE

AND THEY SHALL COME BACK HERE IN THE FOURTH GENERATION FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE AMORITES IS NOT YET COMPLETE

 WHEN THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN AND IT WAS DARK BEHOLD A SMOKING FIRE POT AND A FLAMING TORCH PASSED BETWEEN THESE PIECES

ON THAT DAY THE LORD MADE A COVENANT WITH ABRAM SAYING TO YOUR OFFSPRING I GIVE THIS LAND FROM THE RIVER OF EGYPT TO THE GREAT RIVER THE RIVER EUPHRATES THE LAND OF THE KENITES THE KENIZZITES THE KADMONITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES THE REPHAIM THE AMORITES THE CANAANITES THE GIRGASHITES AND THE JEBUSITES

NOW SARAI ABRAM'S WIFE HAD BORNE HIM NO CHILDREN

SHE HAD A FEMALE EGYPTIAN SERVANT WHOSE NAME WAS HAGAR

AND SARAI SAID TO ABRAM BEHOLD NOW THE LORD HAS PREVENTED ME FROM BEARING CHILDREN

GO IN TO MY SERVANT; IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL OBTAIN CHILDREN BY HER

 AND ABRAM LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF SARAI

SO AFTER ABRAM HAD LIVED TEN YEARS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN SARAI ABRAM'S WIFE TOOK HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN HER SERVANT AND GAVE HER TO ABRAM HER HUSBAND AS A WIFE

AND HE WENT IN TO HAGAR AND SHE CONCEIVED

AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD CONCEIVED SHE LOOKED WITH CONTEMPT ON HER MISTRESS

AND SARAI SAID TO ABRAM MAY THE WRONG DONE TO ME BE ON YOU

I GAVE MY SERVANT TO YOUR EMBRACE AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD CONCEIVED SHE LOOKED ON ME WITH CONTEMPT

MAY THE LORD JUDGE BETWEEN YOU AND ME

 BUT ABRAM SAID TO SARAI BEHOLD YOUR SERVANT IS IN YOUR POWER; DO TO HER AS YOU PLEASE

 THEN SARAI DEALT HARSHLY WITH HER AND SHE FLED FROM HER

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD FOUND HER BY A SPRING OF WATER IN THE WILDERNESS THE SPRING ON THE WAY TO SHUR

AND HE SAID HAGAR SERVANT OF SARAI WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING

 SHE SAID I AM FLEEING FROM MY MISTRESS SARAI

 THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO HER RETURN TO YOUR MISTRESS AND SUBMIT TO HER

 THE ANGEL OF THE LORD ALSO SAID TO HER I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOUR OFFSPRING SO THAT THEY CANNOT BE NUMBERED FOR MULTITUDE

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO HER BEHOLD YOU ARE PREGNANT AND SHALL BEAR A SON

YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISHMAEL BECAUSE THE LORD HAS LISTENED TO YOUR AFFLICTION

HE SHALL BE A WILD DONKEY OF A MAN HIS HAND AGAINST EVERYONE AND EVERYONE'S HAND AGAINST HIM AND HE SHALL DWELL OVER AGAINST ALL HIS KINSMEN

 SO SHE CALLED THE NAME OF THE LORD WHO SPOKE TO HER YOU ARE A GOD OF SEEING FOR SHE SAID TRULY HERE I HAVE SEEN HIM WHO LOOKS AFTER ME

 THEREFORE THE WELL WAS CALLED BEERLAHAIROI; IT LIES BETWEEN KADESH AND BERED

AND HAGAR BORE ABRAM A SON AND ABRAM CALLED THE NAME OF HIS SON WHOM HAGAR BORE ISHMAEL

ABRAM WAS EIGHTYSIX YEARS OLD WHEN HAGAR BORE ISHMAEL TO ABRAM

WHEN ABRAM WAS NINETYNINE YEARS OLD THE LORD APPEARED TO ABRAM AND SAID TO HIM I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; WALK BEFORE ME AND BE BLAMELESS THAT I MAY MAKE MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND MAY MULTIPLY YOU GREATLY

 THEN ABRAM FELL ON HIS FACE

AND GOD SAID TO HIM BEHOLD MY COVENANT IS WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL BE THE FATHER OF A MULTITUDE OF NATIONS

NO LONGER SHALL YOUR NAME BE CALLED ABRAM BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ABRAHAM FOR I HAVE MADE YOU THE FATHER OF A MULTITUDE OF NATIONS

I WILL MAKE YOU EXCEEDINGLY FRUITFUL AND I WILL MAKE YOU INTO NATIONS AND KINGS SHALL COME FROM YOU

AND I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS FOR AN EVERLASTING COVENANT TO BE GOD TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU

AND I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU THE LAND OF YOUR SOJOURNINGS ALL THE LAND OF CANAAN FOR AN EVERLASTING POSSESSION AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD

 AND GOD SAID TO ABRAHAM AS FOR YOU YOU SHALL KEEP MY COVENANT YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS

THIS IS MY COVENANT WHICH YOU SHALL KEEP BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU EVERY MALE AMONG YOU SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED

YOU SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED IN THE FLESH OF YOUR FORESKINS AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN OF THE COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU

HE WHO IS EIGHT DAYS OLD AMONG YOU SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED

EVERY MALE THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS WHETHER BORN IN YOUR HOUSE OR BOUGHT WITH YOUR MONEY FROM ANY FOREIGNER WHO IS NOT OF YOUR OFFSPRING BOTH HE WHO IS BORN IN YOUR HOUSE AND HE WHO IS BOUGHT WITH YOUR MONEY SHALL SURELY BE CIRCUMCISED

SO SHALL MY COVENANT BE IN YOUR FLESH AN EVERLASTING COVENANT

ANY UNCIRCUMCISED MALE WHO IS NOT CIRCUMCISED IN THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE; HE HAS BROKEN MY COVENANT

 AND GOD SAID TO ABRAHAM AS FOR SARAI YOUR WIFE YOU SHALL NOT CALL HER NAME SARAI BUT SARAH SHALL BE HER NAME

I WILL BLESS HER AND MOREOVER I WILL GIVE YOU A SON BY HER

I WILL BLESS HER AND SHE SHALL BECOME NATIONS; KINGS OF PEOPLES SHALL COME FROM HER

 THEN ABRAHAM FELL ON HIS FACE AND LAUGHED AND SAID TO HIMSELF SHALL A CHILD BE BORN TO A MAN WHO IS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD

SHALL SARAH WHO IS NINETY YEARS OLD BEAR A CHILD

 AND ABRAHAM SAID TO GOD OH THAT ISHMAEL MIGHT LIVE BEFORE YOU

 GOD SAID NO BUT SARAH YOUR WIFE SHALL BEAR YOU A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME ISAAC

I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH HIM AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT FOR HIS OFFSPRING AFTER HIM

AS FOR ISHMAEL I HAVE HEARD YOU; BEHOLD I HAVE BLESSED HIM AND WILL MAKE HIM FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY HIM GREATLY

HE SHALL FATHER TWELVE PRINCES AND I WILL MAKE HIM INTO A GREAT NATION

BUT I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH ISAAC WHOM SARAH SHALL BEAR TO YOU AT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR

 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED TALKING WITH HIM GOD WENT UP FROM ABRAHAM

THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ISHMAEL HIS SON AND ALL THOSE BORN IN HIS HOUSE OR BOUGHT WITH HIS MONEY EVERY MALE AMONG THE MEN OF ABRAHAM'S HOUSE AND HE CIRCUMCISED THE FLESH OF THEIR FORESKINS THAT VERY DAY AS GOD HAD SAID TO HIM

ABRAHAM WAS NINETYNINE YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS CIRCUMCISED IN THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN

AND ISHMAEL HIS SON WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS CIRCUMCISED IN THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN

THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM AND HIS SON ISHMAEL WERE CIRCUMCISED

AND ALL THE MEN OF HIS HOUSE THOSE BORN IN THE HOUSE AND THOSE BOUGHT WITH MONEY FROM A FOREIGNER WERE CIRCUMCISED WITH HIM

AND THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM BY THE OAKS OF MAMRE AS HE SAT AT THE DOOR OF HIS TENT IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY

HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD THREE MEN WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM

WHEN HE SAW THEM HE RAN FROM THE TENT DOOR TO MEET THEM AND BOWED HIMSELF TO THE EARTH AND SAID O LORD IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT DO NOT PASS BY YOUR SERVANT

LET A LITTLE WATER BE BROUGHT AND WASH YOUR FEET AND REST YOURSELVES UNDER THE TREE WHILE I BRING A MORSEL OF BREAD THAT YOU MAY REFRESH YOURSELVES AND AFTER THAT YOU MAY PASS ONSINCE YOU HAVE COME TO YOUR SERVANT

 SO THEY SAID DO AS YOU HAVE SAID

 AND ABRAHAM WENT QUICKLY INTO THE TENT TO SARAH AND SAID QUICK

THREE SEAHS OF FINE FLOUR

KNEAD IT AND MAKE CAKES

 AND ABRAHAM RAN TO THE HERD AND TOOK A CALF TENDER AND GOOD AND GAVE IT TO A YOUNG MAN WHO PREPARED IT QUICKLY

THEN HE TOOK CURDS AND MILK AND THE CALF THAT HE HAD PREPARED AND SET IT BEFORE THEM

AND HE STOOD BY THEM UNDER THE TREE WHILE THEY ATE

THEY SAID TO HIM WHERE IS SARAH YOUR WIFE

 AND HE SAID SHE IS IN THE TENT

 THE LORD SAID I WILL SURELY RETURN TO YOU ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR AND SARAH YOUR WIFE SHALL HAVE A SON

 AND SARAH WAS LISTENING AT THE TENT DOOR BEHIND HIM

NOW ABRAHAM AND SARAH WERE OLD ADVANCED IN YEARS

THE WAY OF WOMEN HAD CEASED TO BE WITH SARAH

SO SARAH LAUGHED TO HERSELF SAYING AFTER I AM WORN OUT AND MY LORD IS OLD SHALL I HAVE PLEASURE

 THE LORD SAID TO ABRAHAM WHY DID SARAH LAUGH AND SAY 'SHALL I INDEED BEAR A CHILD NOW THAT I AM OLD

' IS ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR THE LORD

AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WILL RETURN TO YOU ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON

 BUT SARAH DENIED IT SAYING I DID NOT LAUGH FOR SHE WAS AFRAID

HE SAID NO BUT YOU DID LAUGH

 THEN THE MEN SET OUT FROM THERE AND THEY LOOKED DOWN TOWARD SODOM

AND ABRAHAM WENT WITH THEM TO SET THEM ON THEIR WAY

THE LORD SAID SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO SEEING THAT ABRAHAM SHALL SURELY BECOME A GREAT AND MIGHTY NATION AND ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED IN HIM

FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM THAT HE MAY COMMAND HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD BY DOING RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE SO THAT THE LORD MAY BRING TO ABRAHAM WHAT HE HAS PROMISED HIM

 THEN THE LORD SAID BECAUSE THE OUTCRY AGAINST SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS GREAT AND THEIR SIN IS VERY GRAVE I WILL GO DOWN TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE OUTCRY THAT HAS COME TO ME

AND IF NOT I WILL KNOW

 SO THE MEN TURNED FROM THERE AND WENT TOWARD SODOM BUT ABRAHAM STILL STOOD BEFORE THE LORD

THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID WILL YOU INDEED SWEEP AWAY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED

SUPPOSE THERE ARE FIFTY RIGHTEOUS WITHIN THE CITY

WILL YOU THEN SWEEP AWAY THE PLACE AND NOT SPARE IT FOR THE FIFTY RIGHTEOUS WHO ARE IN IT

FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING TO PUT THE RIGHTEOUS TO DEATH WITH THE WICKED SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS FARE AS THE WICKED

FAR BE THAT FROM YOU

SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH DO WHAT IS JUST

 AND THE LORD SAID IF I FIND AT SODOM FIFTY RIGHTEOUS IN THE CITY I WILL SPARE THE WHOLE PLACE FOR THEIR SAKE

 ABRAHAM ANSWERED AND SAID BEHOLD I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO SPEAK TO THE LORD I WHO AM BUT DUST AND ASHES

SUPPOSE FIVE OF THE FIFTY RIGHTEOUS ARE LACKING

WILL YOU DESTROY THE WHOLE CITY FOR LACK OF FIVE

 AND HE SAID I WILL NOT DESTROY IT IF I FIND FORTYFIVE THERE

 AGAIN HE SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID SUPPOSE FORTY ARE FOUND THERE

 HE ANSWERED FOR THE SAKE OF FORTY I WILL NOT DO IT

 THEN HE SAID OH LET NOT THE LORD BE ANGRY AND I WILL SPEAK

SUPPOSE THIRTY ARE FOUND THERE

 HE ANSWERED I WILL NOT DO IT IF I FIND THIRTY THERE

 HE SAID BEHOLD I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO SPEAK TO THE LORD

SUPPOSE TWENTY ARE FOUND THERE

 HE ANSWERED FOR THE SAKE OF TWENTY I WILL NOT DESTROY IT

 THEN HE SAID OH LET NOT THE LORD BE ANGRY AND I WILL SPEAK AGAIN BUT THIS ONCE

SUPPOSE TEN ARE FOUND THERE

 HE ANSWERED FOR THE SAKE OF TEN I WILL NOT DESTROY IT

 AND THE LORD WENT HIS WAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING TO ABRAHAM AND ABRAHAM RETURNED TO HIS PLACE

THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING AND LOT WAS SITTING IN THE GATE OF SODOM

WHEN LOT SAW THEM HE ROSE TO MEET THEM AND BOWED HIMSELF WITH HIS FACE TO THE EARTH AND SAID MY LORDS PLEASE TURN ASIDE TO YOUR SERVANT'S HOUSE AND SPEND THE NIGHT AND WASH YOUR FEET

THEN YOU MAY RISE UP EARLY AND GO ON YOUR WAY

 THEY SAID NO; WE WILL SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE TOWN SQUARE

 BUT HE PRESSED THEM STRONGLY; SO THEY TURNED ASIDE TO HIM AND ENTERED HIS HOUSE

AND HE MADE THEM A FEAST AND BAKED UNLEAVENED BREAD AND THEY ATE

BUT BEFORE THEY LAY DOWN THE MEN OF THE CITY THE MEN OF SODOM BOTH YOUNG AND OLD ALL THE PEOPLE TO THE LAST MAN SURROUNDED THE HOUSE

AND THEY CALLED TO LOT WHERE ARE THE MEN WHO CAME TO YOU TONIGHT

BRING THEM OUT TO US THAT WE MAY KNOW THEM

 LOT WENT OUT TO THE MEN AT THE ENTRANCE SHUT THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND SAID I BEG YOU MY BROTHERS DO NOT ACT SO WICKEDLY

BEHOLD I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN ANY MAN

LET ME BRING THEM OUT TO YOU AND DO TO THEM AS YOU PLEASE

ONLY DO NOTHING TO THESE MEN FOR THEY HAVE COME UNDER THE SHELTER OF MY ROOF

 BUT THEY SAID STAND BACK

 AND THEY SAID THIS FELLOW CAME TO SOJOURN AND HE HAS BECOME THE JUDGE

NOW WE WILL DEAL WORSE WITH YOU THAN WITH THEM

 THEN THEY PRESSED HARD AGAINST THE MAN LOT AND DREW NEAR TO BREAK THE DOOR DOWN

BUT THE MEN REACHED OUT THEIR HANDS AND BROUGHT LOT INTO THE HOUSE WITH THEM AND SHUT THE DOOR

AND THEY STRUCK WITH BLINDNESS THE MEN WHO WERE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOUSE BOTH SMALL AND GREAT SO THAT THEY WORE THEMSELVES OUT GROPING FOR THE DOOR

THEN THE MEN SAID TO LOT HAVE YOU ANYONE ELSE HERE

SONSINLAW SONS DAUGHTERS OR ANYONE YOU HAVE IN THE CITY BRING THEM OUT OF THE PLACE

FOR WE ARE ABOUT TO DESTROY THIS PLACE BECAUSE THE OUTCRY AGAINST ITS PEOPLE HAS BECOME GREAT BEFORE THE LORD AND THE LORD HAS SENT US TO DESTROY IT

 SO LOT WENT OUT AND SAID TO HIS SONSINLAW WHO WERE TO MARRY HIS DAUGHTERS UP

GET OUT OF THIS PLACE FOR THE LORD IS ABOUT TO DESTROY THE CITY

 BUT HE SEEMED TO HIS SONSINLAW TO BE JESTING

AS MORNING DAWNED THE ANGELS URGED LOT SAYING UP

TAKE YOUR WIFE AND YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS WHO ARE HERE LEST YOU BE SWEPT AWAY IN THE PUNISHMENT OF THE CITY

 BUT HE LINGERED

SO THE MEN SEIZED HIM AND HIS WIFE AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS BY THE HAND THE LORD BEING MERCIFUL TO HIM AND THEY BROUGHT HIM OUT AND SET HIM OUTSIDE THE CITY

AND AS THEY BROUGHT THEM OUT ONE SAID ESCAPE FOR YOUR LIFE

DO NOT LOOK BACK OR STOP ANYWHERE IN THE VALLEY

ESCAPE TO THE HILLS LEST YOU BE SWEPT AWAY

 AND LOT SAID TO THEM OH NO MY LORDS

BEHOLD YOUR SERVANT HAS FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT AND YOU HAVE SHOWN ME GREAT KINDNESS IN SAVING MY LIFE

BUT I CANNOT ESCAPE TO THE HILLS LEST THE DISASTER OVERTAKE ME AND I DIE

BEHOLD THIS CITY IS NEAR ENOUGH TO FLEE TO AND IT IS A LITTLE ONE

LET ME ESCAPE THEREIS IT NOT A LITTLE ONE

AND MY LIFE WILL BE SAVED

 HE SAID TO HIM BEHOLD I GRANT YOU THIS FAVOR ALSO THAT I WILL NOT OVERTHROW THE CITY OF WHICH YOU HAVE SPOKEN

ESCAPE THERE QUICKLY FOR I CAN DO NOTHING TILL YOU ARRIVE THERE

 THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS CALLED ZOAR

THE SUN HAD RISEN ON THE EARTH WHEN LOT CAME TO ZOAR

THEN THE LORD RAINED ON SODOM AND GOMORRAH SULFUR AND FIRE FROM THE LORD OUT OF HEAVEN

AND HE OVERTHREW THOSE CITIES AND ALL THE VALLEY AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITIES AND WHAT GREW ON THE GROUND

BUT LOT'S WIFE BEHIND HIM LOOKED BACK AND SHE BECAME A PILLAR OF SALT

AND ABRAHAM WENT EARLY IN THE MORNING TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD STOOD BEFORE THE LORD

AND HE LOOKED DOWN TOWARD SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND TOWARD ALL THE LAND OF THE VALLEY AND HE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE SMOKE OF THE LAND WENT UP LIKE THE SMOKE OF A FURNACE

SO IT WAS THAT WHEN GOD DESTROYED THE CITIES OF THE VALLEY GOD REMEMBERED ABRAHAM AND SENT LOT OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE OVERTHROW WHEN HE OVERTHREW THE CITIES IN WHICH LOT HAD LIVED

NOW LOT WENT UP OUT OF ZOAR AND LIVED IN THE HILLS WITH HIS TWO DAUGHTERS FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LIVE IN ZOAR

SO HE LIVED IN A CAVE WITH HIS TWO DAUGHTERS

AND THE FIRSTBORN SAID TO THE YOUNGER OUR FATHER IS OLD AND THERE IS NOT A MAN ON EARTH TO COME IN TO US AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL THE EARTH

COME LET US MAKE OUR FATHER DRINK WINE AND WE WILL LIE WITH HIM THAT WE MAY PRESERVE OFFSPRING FROM OUR FATHER

 SO THEY MADE THEIR FATHER DRINK WINE THAT NIGHT

AND THE FIRSTBORN WENT IN AND LAY WITH HER FATHER

HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN SHE LAY DOWN OR WHEN SHE AROSE

THE NEXT DAY THE FIRSTBORN SAID TO THE YOUNGER BEHOLD I LAY LAST NIGHT WITH MY FATHER

LET US MAKE HIM DRINK WINE TONIGHT ALSO

THEN YOU GO IN AND LIE WITH HIM THAT WE MAY PRESERVE OFFSPRING FROM OUR FATHER

 SO THEY MADE THEIR FATHER DRINK WINE THAT NIGHT ALSO

AND THE YOUNGER AROSE AND LAY WITH HIM AND HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN SHE LAY DOWN OR WHEN SHE AROSE

THUS BOTH THE DAUGHTERS OF LOT BECAME PREGNANT BY THEIR FATHER

THE FIRSTBORN BORE A SON AND CALLED HIS NAME MOAB

HE IS THE FATHER OF THE MOABITES TO THIS DAY

THE YOUNGER ALSO BORE A SON AND CALLED HIS NAME BENAMMI

HE IS THE FATHER OF THE AMMONITES TO THIS DAY

FROM THERE ABRAHAM JOURNEYED TOWARD THE TERRITORY OF THE NEGEB AND LIVED BETWEEN KADESH AND SHUR; AND HE SOJOURNED IN GERAR

AND ABRAHAM SAID OF SARAH HIS WIFE SHE IS MY SISTER

 AND ABIMELECH KING OF GERAR SENT AND TOOK SARAH

BUT GOD CAME TO ABIMELECH IN A DREAM BY NIGHT AND SAID TO HIM BEHOLD YOU ARE A DEAD MAN BECAUSE OF THE WOMAN WHOM YOU HAVE TAKEN FOR SHE IS A MAN'S WIFE

 NOW ABIMELECH HAD NOT APPROACHED HER

SO HE SAID LORD WILL YOU KILL AN INNOCENT PEOPLE

DID HE NOT HIMSELF SAY TO ME 'SHE IS MY SISTER'

AND SHE HERSELF SAID 'HE IS MY BROTHER

' IN THE INTEGRITY OF MY HEART AND THE INNOCENCE OF MY HANDS I HAVE DONE THIS

 THEN GOD SAID TO HIM IN THE DREAM YES I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE THIS IN THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR HEART AND IT WAS I WHO KEPT YOU FROM SINNING AGAINST ME

THEREFORE I DID NOT LET YOU TOUCH HER

NOW THEN RETURN THE MAN'S WIFE FOR HE IS A PROPHET SO THAT HE WILL PRAY FOR YOU AND YOU SHALL LIVE

BUT IF YOU DO NOT RETURN HER KNOW THAT YOU SHALL SURELY DIE YOU AND ALL WHO ARE YOURS

 SO ABIMELECH ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND CALLED ALL HIS SERVANTS AND TOLD THEM ALL THESE THINGS

AND THE MEN WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID

THEN ABIMELECH CALLED ABRAHAM AND SAID TO HIM WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US

AND HOW HAVE I SINNED AGAINST YOU THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT ON ME AND MY KINGDOM A GREAT SIN

YOU HAVE DONE TO ME THINGS THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE DONE

 AND ABIMELECH SAID TO ABRAHAM WHAT DID YOU SEE THAT YOU DID THIS THING

 ABRAHAM SAID I DID IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD AT ALL IN THIS PLACE AND THEY WILL KILL ME BECAUSE OF MY WIFE

BESIDES SHE IS INDEED MY SISTER THE DAUGHTER OF MY FATHER THOUGH NOT THE DAUGHTER OF MY MOTHER AND SHE BECAME MY WIFE

AND WHEN GOD CAUSED ME TO WANDER FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE I SAID TO HER 'THIS IS THE KINDNESS YOU MUST DO ME AT EVERY PLACE TO WHICH WE COME SAY OF ME HE IS MY BROTHER

' THEN ABIMELECH TOOK SHEEP AND OXEN AND MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS AND GAVE THEM TO ABRAHAM AND RETURNED SARAH HIS WIFE TO HIM

AND ABIMELECH SAID BEHOLD MY LAND IS BEFORE YOU; DWELL WHERE IT PLEASES YOU

 TO SARAH HE SAID BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER

IT IS A SIGN OF YOUR INNOCENCE IN THE EYES OF ALL WHO ARE WITH YOU AND BEFORE EVERYONE YOU ARE VINDICATED

 THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED TO GOD AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH AND ALSO HEALED HIS WIFE AND FEMALE SLAVES SO THAT THEY BORE CHILDREN

FOR THE LORD HAD CLOSED ALL THE WOMBS OF THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH BECAUSE OF SARAH ABRAHAM'S WIFE

THE LORD VISITED SARAH AS HE HAD SAID AND THE LORD DID TO SARAH AS HE HAD PROMISED

AND SARAH CONCEIVED AND BORE ABRAHAM A SON IN HIS OLD AGE AT THE TIME OF WHICH GOD HAD SPOKEN TO HIM

ABRAHAM CALLED THE NAME OF HIS SON WHO WAS BORN TO HIM WHOM SARAH BORE HIM ISAAC

AND ABRAHAM CIRCUMCISED HIS SON ISAAC WHEN HE WAS EIGHT DAYS OLD AS GOD HAD COMMANDED HIM

ABRAHAM WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HIS SON ISAAC WAS BORN TO HIM

AND SARAH SAID GOD HAS MADE LAUGHTER FOR ME; EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH OVER ME

 AND SHE SAID WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD NURSE CHILDREN

YET I HAVE BORNE HIM A SON IN HIS OLD AGE

 AND THE CHILD GREW AND WAS WEANED

AND ABRAHAM MADE A GREAT FEAST ON THE DAY THAT ISAAC WAS WEANED

BUT SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO ABRAHAM LAUGHING

SO SHE SAID TO ABRAHAM CAST OUT THIS SLAVE WOMAN WITH HER SON FOR THE SON OF THIS SLAVE WOMAN SHALL NOT BE HEIR WITH MY SON ISAAC

 AND THE THING WAS VERY DISPLEASING TO ABRAHAM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SON

BUT GOD SAID TO ABRAHAM BE NOT DISPLEASED BECAUSE OF THE BOY AND BECAUSE OF YOUR SLAVE WOMAN

WHATEVER SARAH SAYS TO YOU DO AS SHE TELLS YOU FOR THROUGH ISAAC SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING BE NAMED

AND I WILL MAKE A NATION OF THE SON OF THE SLAVE WOMAN ALSO BECAUSE HE IS YOUR OFFSPRING

 SO ABRAHAM ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND TOOK BREAD AND A SKIN OF WATER AND GAVE IT TO HAGAR PUTTING IT ON HER SHOULDER ALONG WITH THE CHILD AND SENT HER AWAY

AND SHE DEPARTED AND WANDERED IN THE WILDERNESS OF BEERSHEBA

WHEN THE WATER IN THE SKIN WAS GONE SHE PUT THE CHILD UNDER ONE OF THE BUSHES

THEN SHE WENT AND SAT DOWN OPPOSITE HIM A GOOD WAY OFF ABOUT THE DISTANCE OF A BOWSHOT FOR SHE SAID LET ME NOT LOOK ON THE DEATH OF THE CHILD

 AND AS SHE SAT OPPOSITE HIM SHE LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT

AND GOD HEARD THE VOICE OF THE BOY AND THE ANGEL OF GOD CALLED TO HAGAR FROM HEAVEN AND SAID TO HER WHAT TROUBLES YOU HAGAR

FEAR NOT FOR GOD HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE BOY WHERE HE IS

UP

LIFT UP THE BOY AND HOLD HIM FAST WITH YOUR HAND FOR I WILL MAKE HIM INTO A GREAT NATION

 THEN GOD OPENED HER EYES AND SHE SAW A WELL OF WATER

AND SHE WENT AND FILLED THE SKIN WITH WATER AND GAVE THE BOY A DRINK

AND GOD WAS WITH THE BOY AND HE GREW UP

HE LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS AND BECAME AN EXPERT WITH THE BOW

HE LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN AND HIS MOTHER TOOK A WIFE FOR HIM FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT

AT THAT TIME ABIMELECH AND PHICOL THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY SAID TO ABRAHAM GOD IS WITH YOU IN ALL THAT YOU DO

NOW THEREFORE SWEAR TO ME HERE BY GOD THAT YOU WILL NOT DEAL FALSELY WITH ME OR WITH MY DESCENDANTS OR WITH MY POSTERITY BUT AS I HAVE DEALT KINDLY WITH YOU SO YOU WILL DEAL WITH ME AND WITH THE LAND WHERE YOU HAVE SOJOURNED

 AND ABRAHAM SAID I WILL SWEAR

 WHEN ABRAHAM REPROVED ABIMELECH ABOUT A WELL OF WATER THAT ABIMELECH'S SERVANTS HAD SEIZED ABIMELECH SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHO HAS DONE THIS THING; YOU DID NOT TELL ME AND I HAVE NOT HEARD OF IT UNTIL TODAY

 SO ABRAHAM TOOK SHEEP AND OXEN AND GAVE THEM TO ABIMELECH AND THE TWO MEN MADE A COVENANT

ABRAHAM SET SEVEN EWE LAMBS OF THE FLOCK APART

AND ABIMELECH SAID TO ABRAHAM WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THESE SEVEN EWE LAMBS THAT YOU HAVE SET APART

 HE SAID THESE SEVEN EWE LAMBS YOU WILL TAKE FROM MY HAND THAT THIS MAY BE A WITNESS FOR ME THAT I DUG THIS WELL

 THEREFORE THAT PLACE WAS CALLED BEERSHEBA BECAUSE THERE BOTH OF THEM SWORE AN OATH

SO THEY MADE A COVENANT AT BEERSHEBA

THEN ABIMELECH AND PHICOL THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY ROSE UP AND RETURNED TO THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES

ABRAHAM PLANTED A TAMARISK TREE IN BEERSHEBA AND CALLED THERE ON THE NAME OF THE LORD THE EVERLASTING GOD

AND ABRAHAM SOJOURNED MANY DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES

AFTER THESE THINGS GOD TESTED ABRAHAM AND SAID TO HIM ABRAHAM

 AND HE SAID HERE AM I

 HE SAID TAKE YOUR SON YOUR ONLY SON ISAAC WHOM YOU LOVE AND GO TO THE LAND OF MORIAH AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING ON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS OF WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU

 SO ABRAHAM ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING SADDLED HIS DONKEY AND TOOK TWO OF HIS YOUNG MEN WITH HIM AND HIS SON ISAAC

AND HE CUT THE WOOD FOR THE BURNT OFFERING AND AROSE AND WENT TO THE PLACE OF WHICH GOD HAD TOLD HIM

ON THE THIRD DAY ABRAHAM LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW THE PLACE FROM AFAR

THEN ABRAHAM SAID TO HIS YOUNG MEN STAY HERE WITH THE DONKEY; I AND THE BOY WILL GO OVER THERE AND WORSHIP AND COME AGAIN TO YOU

 AND ABRAHAM TOOK THE WOOD OF THE BURNT OFFERING AND LAID IT ON ISAAC HIS SON

AND HE TOOK IN HIS HAND THE FIRE AND THE KNIFE

SO THEY WENT BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER

AND ISAAC SAID TO HIS FATHER ABRAHAM MY FATHER

 AND HE SAID HERE AM I MY SON

 HE SAID BEHOLD THE FIRE AND THE WOOD BUT WHERE IS THE LAMB FOR A BURNT OFFERING

 ABRAHAM SAID GOD WILL PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF THE LAMB FOR A BURNT OFFERING MY SON

 SO THEY WENT BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PLACE OF WHICH GOD HAD TOLD HIM ABRAHAM BUILT THE ALTAR THERE AND LAID THE WOOD IN ORDER AND BOUND ISAAC HIS SON AND LAID HIM ON THE ALTAR ON TOP OF THE WOOD

THEN ABRAHAM REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK THE KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER HIS SON

BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED TO HIM FROM HEAVEN AND SAID ABRAHAM ABRAHAM

 AND HE SAID HERE AM I

 HE SAID DO NOT LAY YOUR HAND ON THE BOY OR DO ANYTHING TO HIM FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD SEEING YOU HAVE NOT WITHHELD YOUR SON YOUR ONLY SON FROM ME

 AND ABRAHAM LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD BEHIND HIM WAS A RAM CAUGHT IN A THICKET BY HIS HORNS

AND ABRAHAM WENT AND TOOK THE RAM AND OFFERED IT UP AS A BURNT OFFERING INSTEAD OF HIS SON

SO ABRAHAM CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE THE LORD WILL PROVIDE; AS IT IS SAID TO THIS DAY ON THE MOUNT OF THE LORD IT SHALL BE PROVIDED

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED TO ABRAHAM A SECOND TIME FROM HEAVEN AND SAID BY MYSELF I HAVE SWORN DECLARES THE LORD BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS AND HAVE NOT WITHHELD YOUR SON YOUR ONLY SON I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOUR OFFSPRING AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND AS THE SAND THAT IS ON THE SEASHORE

AND YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL POSSESS THE GATE OF HIS ENEMIES AND IN YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED BECAUSE YOU HAVE OBEYED MY VOICE

 SO ABRAHAM RETURNED TO HIS YOUNG MEN AND THEY AROSE AND WENT TOGETHER TO BEERSHEBA

AND ABRAHAM LIVED AT BEERSHEBA

NOW AFTER THESE THINGS IT WAS TOLD TO ABRAHAM BEHOLD MILCAH ALSO HAS BORNE CHILDREN TO YOUR BROTHER NAHOR UZ HIS FIRSTBORN BUZ HIS BROTHER KEMUEL THE FATHER OF ARAM CHESED HAZO PILDASH JIDLAPH AND BETHUEL

 BETHUEL FATHERED REBEKAH

 THESE EIGHT MILCAH BORE TO NAHOR ABRAHAM'S BROTHER

MOREOVER HIS CONCUBINE WHOSE NAME WAS REUMAH BORE TEBAH GAHAM TAHASH AND MAACAH

SARAH LIVED  YEARS; THESE WERE THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF SARAH

AND SARAH DIED AT KIRIATHARBA THAT IS HEBRON IN THE LAND OF CANAAN AND ABRAHAM WENT IN TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND TO WEEP FOR HER

AND ABRAHAM ROSE UP FROM BEFORE HIS DEAD AND SAID TO THE HITTITES I AM A SOJOURNER AND FOREIGNER AMONG YOU; GIVE ME PROPERTY AMONG YOU FOR A BURYING PLACE THAT I MAY BURY MY DEAD OUT OF MY SIGHT

 THE HITTITES ANSWERED ABRAHAM HEAR US MY LORD; YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD AMONG US

BURY YOUR DEAD IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR TOMBS

NONE OF US WILL WITHHOLD FROM YOU HIS TOMB TO HINDER YOU FROM BURYING YOUR DEAD

 ABRAHAM ROSE AND BOWED TO THE HITTITES THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

AND HE SAID TO THEM IF YOU ARE WILLING THAT I SHOULD BURY MY DEAD OUT OF MY SIGHT HEAR ME AND ENTREAT FOR ME EPHRON THE SON OF ZOHAR THAT HE MAY GIVE ME THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH WHICH HE OWNS; IT IS AT THE END OF HIS FIELD

FOR THE FULL PRICE LET HIM GIVE IT TO ME IN YOUR PRESENCE AS PROPERTY FOR A BURYING PLACE

 NOW EPHRON WAS SITTING AMONG THE HITTITES AND EPHRON THE HITTITE ANSWERED ABRAHAM IN THE HEARING OF THE HITTITES OF ALL WHO WENT IN AT THE GATE OF HIS CITY NO MY LORD HEAR ME I GIVE YOU THE FIELD AND I GIVE YOU THE CAVE THAT IS IN IT

IN THE SIGHT OF THE SONS OF MY PEOPLE I GIVE IT TO YOU

BURY YOUR DEAD

 THEN ABRAHAM BOWED DOWN BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

AND HE SAID TO EPHRON IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND BUT IF YOU WILL HEAR ME I GIVE THE PRICE OF THE FIELD

ACCEPT IT FROM ME THAT I MAY BURY MY DEAD THERE

 EPHRON ANSWERED ABRAHAM MY LORD LISTEN TO ME A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER WHAT IS THAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME

BURY YOUR DEAD

 ABRAHAM LISTENED TO EPHRON AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT FOR EPHRON THE SILVER THAT HE HAD NAMED IN THE HEARING OF THE HITTITES FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER ACCORDING TO THE WEIGHTS CURRENT AMONG THE MERCHANTS

SO THE FIELD OF EPHRON IN MACHPELAH WHICH WAS TO THE EAST OF MAMRE THE FIELD WITH THE CAVE THAT WAS IN IT AND ALL THE TREES THAT WERE IN THE FIELD THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE AREA WAS MADE OVER TO ABRAHAM AS A POSSESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HITTITES BEFORE ALL WHO WENT IN AT THE GATE OF HIS CITY

AFTER THIS ABRAHAM BURIED SARAH HIS WIFE IN THE CAVE OF THE FIELD OF MACHPELAH EAST OF MAMRE THAT IS HEBRON IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

THE FIELD AND THE CAVE THAT IS IN IT WERE MADE OVER TO ABRAHAM AS PROPERTY FOR A BURYING PLACE BY THE HITTITES

NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD WELL ADVANCED IN YEARS

AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS

AND ABRAHAM SAID TO HIS SERVANT THE OLDEST OF HIS HOUSEHOLD WHO HAD CHARGE OF ALL THAT HE HAD PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH THAT I MAY MAKE YOU SWEAR BY THE LORD THE GOD OF HEAVEN AND GOD OF THE EARTH THAT YOU WILL NOT TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF THE CANAANITES AMONG WHOM I DWELL BUT WILL GO TO MY COUNTRY AND TO MY KINDRED AND TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON ISAAC

 THE SERVANT SAID TO HIM PERHAPS THE WOMAN MAY NOT BE WILLING TO FOLLOW ME TO THIS LAND

MUST I THEN TAKE YOUR SON BACK TO THE LAND FROM WHICH YOU CAME

 ABRAHAM SAID TO HIM SEE TO IT THAT YOU DO NOT TAKE MY SON BACK THERE

THE LORD THE GOD OF HEAVEN WHO TOOK ME FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE LAND OF MY KINDRED AND WHO SPOKE TO ME AND SWORE TO ME 'TO YOUR OFFSPRING I WILL GIVE THIS LAND' HE WILL SEND HIS ANGEL BEFORE YOU AND YOU SHALL TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON FROM THERE

BUT IF THE WOMAN IS NOT WILLING TO FOLLOW YOU THEN YOU WILL BE FREE FROM THIS OATH OF MINE; ONLY YOU MUST NOT TAKE MY SON BACK THERE

 SO THE SERVANT PUT HIS HAND UNDER THE THIGH OF ABRAHAM HIS MASTER AND SWORE TO HIM CONCERNING THIS MATTER

THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN OF HIS MASTER'S CAMELS AND DEPARTED TAKING ALL SORTS OF CHOICE GIFTS FROM HIS MASTER; AND HE AROSE AND WENT TO MESOPOTAMIA TO THE CITY OF NAHOR

AND HE MADE THE CAMELS KNEEL DOWN OUTSIDE THE CITY BY THE WELL OF WATER AT THE TIME OF EVENING THE TIME WHEN WOMEN GO OUT TO DRAW WATER

AND HE SAID O LORD GOD OF MY MASTER ABRAHAM PLEASE GRANT ME SUCCESS TODAY AND SHOW STEADFAST LOVE TO MY MASTER ABRAHAM

BEHOLD I AM STANDING BY THE SPRING OF WATER AND THE DAUGHTERS OF THE MEN OF THE CITY ARE COMING OUT TO DRAW WATER

LET THE YOUNG WOMAN TO WHOM I SHALL SAY 'PLEASE LET DOWN YOUR JAR THAT I MAY DRINK' AND WHO SHALL SAY 'DRINK AND I WILL WATER YOUR CAMELS'LET HER BE THE ONE WHOM YOU HAVE APPOINTED FOR YOUR SERVANT ISAAC

BY THIS I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN STEADFAST LOVE TO MY MASTER

 BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING BEHOLD REBEKAH WHO WAS BORN TO BETHUEL THE SON OF MILCAH THE WIFE OF NAHOR ABRAHAM'S BROTHER CAME OUT WITH HER WATER JAR ON HER SHOULDER

THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE IN APPEARANCE A MAIDEN WHOM NO MAN HAD KNOWN

SHE WENT DOWN TO THE SPRING AND FILLED HER JAR AND CAME UP

THEN THE SERVANT RAN TO MEET HER AND SAID PLEASE GIVE ME A LITTLE WATER TO DRINK FROM YOUR JAR

 SHE SAID DRINK MY LORD

 AND SHE QUICKLY LET DOWN HER JAR UPON HER HAND AND GAVE HIM A DRINK

WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED GIVING HIM A DRINK SHE SAID I WILL DRAW WATER FOR YOUR CAMELS ALSO UNTIL THEY HAVE FINISHED DRINKING

 SO SHE QUICKLY EMPTIED HER JAR INTO THE TROUGH AND RAN AGAIN TO THE WELL TO DRAW WATER AND SHE DREW FOR ALL HIS CAMELS

THE MAN GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE TO LEARN WHETHER THE LORD HAD PROSPERED HIS JOURNEY OR NOT

WHEN THE CAMELS HAD FINISHED DRINKING THE MAN TOOK A GOLD RING WEIGHING A HALF SHEKEL AND TWO BRACELETS FOR HER ARMS WEIGHING TEN GOLD SHEKELS AND SAID PLEASE TELL ME WHOSE DAUGHTER YOU ARE

IS THERE ROOM IN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE FOR US TO SPEND THE NIGHT

 SHE SAID TO HIM I AM THE DAUGHTER OF BETHUEL THE SON OF MILCAH WHOM SHE BORE TO NAHOR

 SHE ADDED WE HAVE PLENTY OF BOTH STRAW AND FODDER AND ROOM TO SPEND THE NIGHT

 THE MAN BOWED HIS HEAD AND WORSHIPED THE LORD AND SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF MY MASTER ABRAHAM WHO HAS NOT FORSAKEN HIS STEADFAST LOVE AND HIS FAITHFULNESS TOWARD MY MASTER

AS FOR ME THE LORD HAS LED ME IN THE WAY TO THE HOUSE OF MY MASTER'S KINSMEN

 THEN THE YOUNG WOMAN RAN AND TOLD HER MOTHER'S HOUSEHOLD ABOUT THESE THINGS

REBEKAH HAD A BROTHER WHOSE NAME WAS LABAN

LABAN RAN OUT TOWARD THE MAN TO THE SPRING

AS SOON AS HE SAW THE RING AND THE BRACELETS ON HIS SISTER'S ARMS AND HEARD THE WORDS OF REBEKAH HIS SISTER THUS THE MAN SPOKE TO ME HE WENT TO THE MAN

AND BEHOLD HE WAS STANDING BY THE CAMELS AT THE SPRING

HE SAID COME IN O BLESSED OF THE LORD

WHY DO YOU STAND OUTSIDE

FOR I HAVE PREPARED THE HOUSE AND A PLACE FOR THE CAMELS

 SO THE MAN CAME TO THE HOUSE AND UNHARNESSED THE CAMELS AND GAVE STRAW AND FODDER TO THE CAMELS AND THERE WAS WATER TO WASH HIS FEET AND THE FEET OF THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM

THEN FOOD WAS SET BEFORE HIM TO EAT

BUT HE SAID I WILL NOT EAT UNTIL I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

 HE SAID SPEAK ON

 SO HE SAID I AM ABRAHAM'S SERVANT

THE LORD HAS GREATLY BLESSED MY MASTER AND HE HAS BECOME GREAT

HE HAS GIVEN HIM FLOCKS AND HERDS SILVER AND GOLD MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS CAMELS AND DONKEYS

AND SARAH MY MASTER'S WIFE BORE A SON TO MY MASTER WHEN SHE WAS OLD AND TO HIM HE HAS GIVEN ALL THAT HE HAS

MY MASTER MADE ME SWEAR SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF THE CANAANITES IN WHOSE LAND I DWELL BUT YOU SHALL GO TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND TO MY CLAN AND TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON

' I SAID TO MY MASTER 'PERHAPS THE WOMAN WILL NOT FOLLOW ME

' BUT HE SAID TO ME 'THE LORD BEFORE WHOM I HAVE WALKED WILL SEND HIS ANGEL WITH YOU AND PROSPER YOUR WAY

YOU SHALL TAKE A WIFE FOR MY SON FROM MY CLAN AND FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE

THEN YOU WILL BE FREE FROM MY OATH WHEN YOU COME TO MY CLAN

AND IF THEY WILL NOT GIVE HER TO YOU YOU WILL BE FREE FROM MY OATH

' I CAME TODAY TO THE SPRING AND SAID 'O LORD THE GOD OF MY MASTER ABRAHAM IF NOW YOU ARE PROSPERING THE WAY THAT I GO BEHOLD I AM STANDING BY THE SPRING OF WATER

LET THE VIRGIN WHO COMES OUT TO DRAW WATER TO WHOM I SHALL SAY PLEASE GIVE ME A LITTLE WATER FROM YOUR JAR TO DRINK AND WHO WILL SAY TO ME DRINK AND I WILL DRAW FOR YOUR CAMELS ALSO LET HER BE THE WOMAN WHOM THE LORD HAS APPOINTED FOR MY MASTER'S SON

' BEFORE I HAD FINISHED SPEAKING IN MY HEART BEHOLD REBEKAH CAME OUT WITH HER WATER JAR ON HER SHOULDER AND SHE WENT DOWN TO THE SPRING AND DREW WATER

I SAID TO HER 'PLEASE LET ME DRINK

' SHE QUICKLY LET DOWN HER JAR FROM HER SHOULDER AND SAID 'DRINK AND I WILL GIVE YOUR CAMELS DRINK ALSO

' SO I DRANK AND SHE GAVE THE CAMELS DRINK ALSO

THEN I ASKED HER 'WHOSE DAUGHTER ARE YOU

' SHE SAID 'THE DAUGHTER OF BETHUEL NAHOR'S SON WHOM MILCAH BORE TO HIM

' SO I PUT THE RING ON HER NOSE AND THE BRACELETS ON HER ARMS

THEN I BOWED MY HEAD AND WORSHIPED THE LORD AND BLESSED THE LORD THE GOD OF MY MASTER ABRAHAM WHO HAD LED ME BY THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF MY MASTER'S KINSMAN FOR HIS SON

NOW THEN IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO MY MASTER TELL ME; AND IF NOT TELL ME THAT I MAY TURN TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT

 THEN LABAN AND BETHUEL ANSWERED AND SAID THE THING HAS COME FROM THE LORD; WE CANNOT SPEAK TO YOU BAD OR GOOD

BEHOLD REBEKAH IS BEFORE YOU; TAKE HER AND GO AND LET HER BE THE WIFE OF YOUR MASTER'S SON AS THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

 WHEN ABRAHAM'S SERVANT HEARD THEIR WORDS HE BOWED HIMSELF TO THE EARTH BEFORE THE LORD

AND THE SERVANT BROUGHT OUT JEWELRY OF SILVER AND OF GOLD AND GARMENTS AND GAVE THEM TO REBEKAH

HE ALSO GAVE TO HER BROTHER AND TO HER MOTHER COSTLY ORNAMENTS

AND HE AND THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM ATE AND DRANK AND THEY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE

WHEN THEY AROSE IN THE MORNING HE SAID SEND ME AWAY TO MY MASTER

 HER BROTHER AND HER MOTHER SAID LET THE YOUNG WOMAN REMAIN WITH US A WHILE AT LEAST TEN DAYS; AFTER THAT SHE MAY GO

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM DO NOT DELAY ME SINCE THE LORD HAS PROSPERED MY WAY

SEND ME AWAY THAT I MAY GO TO MY MASTER

 THEY SAID LET US CALL THE YOUNG WOMAN AND ASK HER

 AND THEY CALLED REBEKAH AND SAID TO HER WILL YOU GO WITH THIS MAN

 SHE SAID I WILL GO

 SO THEY SENT AWAY REBEKAH THEIR SISTER AND HER NURSE AND ABRAHAM'S SERVANT AND HIS MEN

AND THEY BLESSED REBEKAH AND SAID TO HER OUR SISTER MAY YOU BECOME THOUSANDS OF TEN THOUSANDS AND MAY YOUR OFFSPRING POSSESS THE GATE OF THOSE WHO HATE THEM

 THEN REBEKAH AND HER YOUNG WOMEN AROSE AND RODE ON THE CAMELS AND FOLLOWED THE MAN

THUS THE SERVANT TOOK REBEKAH AND WENT HIS WAY

NOW ISAAC HAD RETURNED FROM BEERLAHAIROI AND WAS DWELLING IN THE NEGEB

AND ISAAC WENT OUT TO MEDITATE IN THE FIELD TOWARD EVENING

AND HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD THERE WERE CAMELS COMING

AND REBEKAH LIFTED UP HER EYES AND WHEN SHE SAW ISAAC SHE DISMOUNTED FROM THE CAMEL AND SAID TO THE SERVANT WHO IS THAT MAN WALKING IN THE FIELD TO MEET US

 THE SERVANT SAID IT IS MY MASTER

 SO SHE TOOK HER VEIL AND COVERED HERSELF

AND THE SERVANT TOLD ISAAC ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAD DONE

THEN ISAAC BROUGHT HER INTO THE TENT OF SARAH HIS MOTHER AND TOOK REBEKAH AND SHE BECAME HIS WIFE AND HE LOVED HER

SO ISAAC WAS COMFORTED AFTER HIS MOTHER'S DEATH

ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE WHOSE NAME WAS KETURAH

SHE BORE HIM ZIMRAN JOKSHAN MEDAN MIDIAN ISHBAK AND SHUAH

JOKSHAN FATHERED SHEBA AND DEDAN

THE SONS OF DEDAN WERE ASSHURIM LETUSHIM AND LEUMMIM

THE SONS OF MIDIAN WERE EPHAH EPHER HANOCH ABIDA AND ELDAAH

ALL THESE WERE THE CHILDREN OF KETURAH

ABRAHAM GAVE ALL HE HAD TO ISAAC

BUT TO THE SONS OF HIS CONCUBINES ABRAHAM GAVE GIFTS AND WHILE HE WAS STILL LIVING HE SENT THEM AWAY FROM HIS SON ISAAC EASTWARD TO THE EAST COUNTRY

THESE ARE THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF ABRAHAM'S LIFE  YEARS

ABRAHAM BREATHED HIS LAST AND DIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE AN OLD MAN AND FULL OF YEARS AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE

ISAAC AND ISHMAEL HIS SONS BURIED HIM IN THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH IN THE FIELD OF EPHRON THE SON OF ZOHAR THE HITTITE EAST OF MAMRE THE FIELD THAT ABRAHAM PURCHASED FROM THE HITTITES

THERE ABRAHAM WAS BURIED WITH SARAH HIS WIFE

AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM GOD BLESSED ISAAC HIS SON

AND ISAAC SETTLED AT BEERLAHAIROI

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL ABRAHAM'S SON WHOM HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN SARAH'S SERVANT BORE TO ABRAHAM

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE SONS OF ISHMAEL NAMED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR BIRTH NEBAIOTH THE FIRSTBORN OF ISHMAEL; AND KEDAR ADBEEL MIBSAM MISHMA DUMAH MASSA HADAD TEMA JETUR NAPHISH AND KEDEMAH

THESE ARE THE SONS OF ISHMAEL AND THESE ARE THEIR NAMES BY THEIR VILLAGES AND BY THEIR ENCAMPMENTS TWELVE PRINCES ACCORDING TO THEIR TRIBES

THESE ARE THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF ISHMAEL  YEARS

HE BREATHED HIS LAST AND DIED AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE

 THEY SETTLED FROM HAVILAH TO SHUR WHICH IS OPPOSITE EGYPT IN THE DIRECTION OF ASSYRIA

HE SETTLED OVER AGAINST ALL HIS KINSMEN

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISAAC ABRAHAM'S SON ABRAHAM FATHERED ISAAC AND ISAAC WAS FORTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE TOOK REBEKAH TO BE HIS WIFE THE DAUGHTER OF BETHUEL THE ARAMEAN OF PADDANARAM THE SISTER OF LABAN THE ARAMEAN

AND ISAAC PRAYED TO THE LORD FOR HIS WIFE BECAUSE SHE WAS BARREN

AND THE LORD GRANTED HIS PRAYER AND REBEKAH HIS WIFE CONCEIVED

THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED TOGETHER WITHIN HER AND SHE SAID IF IT IS THUS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME

 SO SHE WENT TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID TO HER TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB AND TWO PEOPLES FROM WITHIN YOU SHALL BE DIVIDED; THE ONE SHALL BE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER THE OLDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER

 WHEN HER DAYS TO GIVE BIRTH WERE COMPLETED BEHOLD THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB

THE FIRST CAME OUT RED ALL HIS BODY LIKE A HAIRY CLOAK SO THEY CALLED HIS NAME ESAU

AFTERWARD HIS BROTHER CAME OUT WITH HIS HAND HOLDING ESAU'S HEEL SO HIS NAME WAS CALLED JACOB

ISAAC WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD WHEN SHE BORE THEM

WHEN THE BOYS GREW UP ESAU WAS A SKILLFUL HUNTER A MAN OF THE FIELD WHILE JACOB WAS A QUIET MAN DWELLING IN TENTS

ISAAC LOVED ESAU BECAUSE HE ATE OF HIS GAME BUT REBEKAH LOVED JACOB

ONCE WHEN JACOB WAS COOKING STEW ESAU CAME IN FROM THE FIELD AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED

AND ESAU SAID TO JACOB LET ME EAT SOME OF THAT RED STEW FOR I AM EXHAUSTED

 THEREFORE HIS NAME WAS CALLED EDOM

 JACOB SAID SELL ME YOUR BIRTHRIGHT NOW

 ESAU SAID I AM ABOUT TO DIE; OF WHAT USE IS A BIRTHRIGHT TO ME

 JACOB SAID SWEAR TO ME NOW

 SO HE SWORE TO HIM AND SOLD HIS BIRTHRIGHT TO JACOB

THEN JACOB GAVE ESAU BREAD AND LENTIL STEW AND HE ATE AND DRANK AND ROSE AND WENT HIS WAY

THUS ESAU DESPISED HIS BIRTHRIGHT

NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND BESIDES THE FORMER FAMINE THAT WAS IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM

AND ISAAC WENT TO GERAR TO ABIMELECH KING OF THE PHILISTINES

AND THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM AND SAID DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT; DWELL IN THE LAND OF WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU

SOJOURN IN THIS LAND AND I WILL BE WITH YOU AND WILL BLESS YOU FOR TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING I WILL GIVE ALL THESE LANDS AND I WILL ESTABLISH THE OATH THAT I SWORE TO ABRAHAM YOUR FATHER

I WILL MULTIPLY YOUR OFFSPRING AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND WILL GIVE TO YOUR OFFSPRING ALL THESE LANDS

AND IN YOUR OFFSPRING ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED BECAUSE ABRAHAM OBEYED MY VOICE AND KEPT MY CHARGE MY COMMANDMENTS MY STATUTES AND MY LAWS

 SO ISAAC SETTLED IN GERAR

WHEN THE MEN OF THE PLACE ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS WIFE HE SAID SHE IS MY SISTER FOR HE FEARED TO SAY MY WIFE THINKING LEST THE MEN OF THE PLACE SHOULD KILL ME BECAUSE OF REBEKAH BECAUSE SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE IN APPEARANCE

WHEN HE HAD BEEN THERE A LONG TIME ABIMELECH KING OF THE PHILISTINES LOOKED OUT OF A WINDOW AND SAW ISAAC LAUGHING WITH REBEKAH HIS WIFE

SO ABIMELECH CALLED ISAAC AND SAID BEHOLD SHE IS YOUR WIFE

HOW THEN COULD YOU SAY 'SHE IS MY SISTER'

 ISAAC SAID TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT 'LEST I DIE BECAUSE OF HER

' ABIMELECH SAID WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE TO US

ONE OF THE PEOPLE MIGHT EASILY HAVE LAIN WITH YOUR WIFE AND YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT GUILT UPON US

 SO ABIMELECH WARNED ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING WHOEVER TOUCHES THIS MAN OR HIS WIFE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH

 AND ISAAC SOWED IN THAT LAND AND REAPED IN THE SAME YEAR A HUNDREDFOLD

THE LORD BLESSED HIM AND THE MAN BECAME RICH AND GAINED MORE AND MORE UNTIL HE BECAME VERY WEALTHY

HE HAD POSSESSIONS OF FLOCKS AND HERDS AND MANY SERVANTS SO THAT THE PHILISTINES ENVIED HIM

NOW THE PHILISTINES HAD STOPPED AND FILLED WITH EARTH ALL THE WELLS THAT HIS FATHER'S SERVANTS HAD DUG IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM HIS FATHER

 AND ABIMELECH SAID TO ISAAC GO AWAY FROM US FOR YOU ARE MUCH MIGHTIER THAN WE

 SO ISAAC DEPARTED FROM THERE AND ENCAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF GERAR AND SETTLED THERE

AND ISAAC DUG AGAIN THE WELLS OF WATER THAT HAD BEEN DUG IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM HIS FATHER WHICH THE PHILISTINES HAD STOPPED AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM

AND HE GAVE THEM THE NAMES THAT HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN THEM

BUT WHEN ISAAC'S SERVANTS DUG IN THE VALLEY AND FOUND THERE A WELL OF SPRING WATER THE HERDSMEN OF GERAR QUARRELED WITH ISAAC'S HERDSMEN SAYING THE WATER IS OURS

 SO HE CALLED THE NAME OF THE WELL ESEK BECAUSE THEY CONTENDED WITH HIM

THEN THEY DUG ANOTHER WELL AND THEY QUARRELED OVER THAT ALSO SO HE CALLED ITS NAME SITNAH

AND HE MOVED FROM THERE AND DUG ANOTHER WELL AND THEY DID NOT QUARREL OVER IT

SO HE CALLED ITS NAME REHOBOTH SAYING FOR NOW THE LORD HAS MADE ROOM FOR US AND WE SHALL BE FRUITFUL IN THE LAND

 FROM THERE HE WENT UP TO BEERSHEBA

AND THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM THE SAME NIGHT AND SAID I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM YOUR FATHER

FEAR NOT FOR I AM WITH YOU AND WILL BLESS YOU AND MULTIPLY YOUR OFFSPRING FOR MY SERVANT ABRAHAM'S SAKE

 SO HE BUILT AN ALTAR THERE AND CALLED UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD AND PITCHED HIS TENT THERE

AND THERE ISAAC'S SERVANTS DUG A WELL

WHEN ABIMELECH WENT TO HIM FROM GERAR WITH AHUZZATH HIS ADVISER AND PHICOL THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY ISAAC SAID TO THEM WHY HAVE YOU COME TO ME SEEING THAT YOU HATE ME AND HAVE SENT ME AWAY FROM YOU

 THEY SAID WE SEE PLAINLY THAT THE LORD HAS BEEN WITH YOU

SO WE SAID LET THERE BE A SWORN PACT BETWEEN US BETWEEN YOU AND US AND LET US MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU THAT YOU WILL DO US NO HARM JUST AS WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED YOU AND HAVE DONE TO YOU NOTHING BUT GOOD AND HAVE SENT YOU AWAY IN PEACE

YOU ARE NOW THE BLESSED OF THE LORD

 SO HE MADE THEM A FEAST AND THEY ATE AND DRANK

IN THE MORNING THEY ROSE EARLY AND EXCHANGED OATHS

AND ISAAC SENT THEM ON THEIR WAY AND THEY DEPARTED FROM HIM IN PEACE

THAT SAME DAY ISAAC'S SERVANTS CAME AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE WELL THAT THEY HAD DUG AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE FOUND WATER

 HE CALLED IT SHIBAH; THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE CITY IS BEERSHEBA TO THIS DAY

WHEN ESAU WAS FORTY YEARS OLD HE TOOK JUDITH THE DAUGHTER OF BEERI THE HITTITE TO BE HIS WIFE AND BASEMATH THE DAUGHTER OF ELON THE HITTITE AND THEY MADE LIFE BITTER FOR ISAAC AND REBEKAH

WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD AND HIS EYES WERE DIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE HE CALLED ESAU HIS OLDER SON AND SAID TO HIM MY SON; AND HE ANSWERED HERE I AM

 HE SAID BEHOLD I AM OLD; I DO NOT KNOW THE DAY OF MY DEATH

NOW THEN TAKE YOUR WEAPONS YOUR QUIVER AND YOUR BOW AND GO OUT TO THE FIELD AND HUNT GAME FOR ME AND PREPARE FOR ME DELICIOUS FOOD SUCH AS I LOVE AND BRING IT TO ME SO THAT I MAY EAT THAT MY SOUL MAY BLESS YOU BEFORE I DIE

 NOW REBEKAH WAS LISTENING WHEN ISAAC SPOKE TO HIS SON ESAU

SO WHEN ESAU WENT TO THE FIELD TO HUNT FOR GAME AND BRING IT REBEKAH SAID TO HER SON JACOB I HEARD YOUR FATHER SPEAK TO YOUR BROTHER ESAU 'BRING ME GAME AND PREPARE FOR ME DELICIOUS FOOD THAT I MAY EAT IT AND BLESS YOU BEFORE THE LORD BEFORE I DIE

' NOW THEREFORE MY SON OBEY MY VOICE AS I COMMAND YOU

GO TO THE FLOCK AND BRING ME TWO GOOD YOUNG GOATS SO THAT I MAY PREPARE FROM THEM DELICIOUS FOOD FOR YOUR FATHER SUCH AS HE LOVES

AND YOU SHALL BRING IT TO YOUR FATHER TO EAT SO THAT HE MAY BLESS YOU BEFORE HE DIES

 BUT JACOB SAID TO REBEKAH HIS MOTHER BEHOLD MY BROTHER ESAU IS A HAIRY MAN AND I AM A SMOOTH MAN

PERHAPS MY FATHER WILL FEEL ME AND I SHALL SEEM TO BE MOCKING HIM AND BRING A CURSE UPON MYSELF AND NOT A BLESSING

 HIS MOTHER SAID TO HIM LET YOUR CURSE BE ON ME MY SON; ONLY OBEY MY VOICE AND GO BRING THEM TO ME

 SO HE WENT AND TOOK THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS MOTHER PREPARED DELICIOUS FOOD SUCH AS HIS FATHER LOVED

THEN REBEKAH TOOK THE BEST GARMENTS OF ESAU HER OLDER SON WHICH WERE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE AND PUT THEM ON JACOB HER YOUNGER SON

AND THE SKINS OF THE YOUNG GOATS SHE PUT ON HIS HANDS AND ON THE SMOOTH PART OF HIS NECK

AND SHE PUT THE DELICIOUS FOOD AND THE BREAD WHICH SHE HAD PREPARED INTO THE HAND OF HER SON JACOB

SO HE WENT IN TO HIS FATHER AND SAID MY FATHER

 AND HE SAID HERE I AM

WHO ARE YOU MY SON

 JACOB SAID TO HIS FATHER I AM ESAU YOUR FIRSTBORN

I HAVE DONE AS YOU TOLD ME; NOW SIT UP AND EAT OF MY GAME THAT YOUR SOUL MAY BLESS ME

 BUT ISAAC SAID TO HIS SON HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAVE FOUND IT SO QUICKLY MY SON

 HE ANSWERED BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD GRANTED ME SUCCESS

 THEN ISAAC SAID TO JACOB PLEASE COME NEAR THAT I MAY FEEL YOU MY SON TO KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE REALLY MY SON ESAU OR NOT

 SO JACOB WENT NEAR TO ISAAC HIS FATHER WHO FELT HIM AND SAID THE VOICE IS JACOB'S VOICE BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU

 AND HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE HAIRY LIKE HIS BROTHER ESAU'S HANDS

SO HE BLESSED HIM

HE SAID ARE YOU REALLY MY SON ESAU

 HE ANSWERED I AM

 THEN HE SAID BRING IT NEAR TO ME THAT I MAY EAT OF MY SON'S GAME AND BLESS YOU

 SO HE BROUGHT IT NEAR TO HIM AND HE ATE; AND HE BROUGHT HIM WINE AND HE DRANK

THEN HIS FATHER ISAAC SAID TO HIM COME NEAR AND KISS ME MY SON

 SO HE CAME NEAR AND KISSED HIM

AND ISAAC SMELLED THE SMELL OF HIS GARMENTS AND BLESSED HIM AND SAID SEE THE SMELL OF MY SON IS AS THE SMELL OF A FIELD THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED

MAY GOD GIVE YOU OF THE DEW OF HEAVEN AND OF THE FATNESS OF THE EARTH AND PLENTY OF GRAIN AND WINE

LET PEOPLES SERVE YOU AND NATIONS BOW DOWN TO YOU

BE LORD OVER YOUR BROTHERS AND MAY YOUR MOTHER'S SONS BOW DOWN TO YOU

CURSED BE EVERYONE WHO CURSES YOU AND BLESSED BE EVERYONE WHO BLESSES YOU

 AS SOON AS ISAAC HAD FINISHED BLESSING JACOB WHEN JACOB HAD SCARCELY GONE OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF ISAAC HIS FATHER ESAU HIS BROTHER CAME IN FROM HIS HUNTING

HE ALSO PREPARED DELICIOUS FOOD AND BROUGHT IT TO HIS FATHER

AND HE SAID TO HIS FATHER LET MY FATHER ARISE AND EAT OF HIS SON'S GAME THAT YOU MAY BLESS ME

 HIS FATHER ISAAC SAID TO HIM WHO ARE YOU

 HE ANSWERED I AM YOUR SON YOUR FIRSTBORN ESAU

 THEN ISAAC TREMBLED VERY VIOLENTLY AND SAID WHO WAS IT THEN THAT HUNTED GAME AND BROUGHT IT TO ME AND I ATE IT ALL BEFORE YOU CAME AND I HAVE BLESSED HIM

YES AND HE SHALL BE BLESSED

 AS SOON AS ESAU HEARD THE WORDS OF HIS FATHER HE CRIED OUT WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT AND BITTER CRY AND SAID TO HIS FATHER BLESS ME EVEN ME ALSO O MY FATHER

 BUT HE SAID YOUR BROTHER CAME DECEITFULLY AND HE HAS TAKEN AWAY YOUR BLESSING

 ESAU SAID IS HE NOT RIGHTLY NAMED JACOB

FOR HE HAS CHEATED ME THESE TWO TIMES

HE TOOK AWAY MY BIRTHRIGHT AND BEHOLD NOW HE HAS TAKEN AWAY MY BLESSING

 THEN HE SAID HAVE YOU NOT RESERVED A BLESSING FOR ME

 ISAAC ANSWERED AND SAID TO ESAU BEHOLD I HAVE MADE HIM LORD OVER YOU AND ALL HIS BROTHERS I HAVE GIVEN TO HIM FOR SERVANTS AND WITH GRAIN AND WINE I HAVE SUSTAINED HIM

WHAT THEN CAN I DO FOR YOU MY SON

 ESAU SAID TO HIS FATHER HAVE YOU BUT ONE BLESSING MY FATHER

BLESS ME EVEN ME ALSO O MY FATHER

 AND ESAU LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT

THEN ISAAC HIS FATHER ANSWERED AND SAID TO HIM BEHOLD AWAY FROM THE FATNESS OF THE EARTH SHALL YOUR DWELLING BE AND AWAY FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN ON HIGH

BY YOUR SWORD YOU SHALL LIVE AND YOU SHALL SERVE YOUR BROTHER; BUT WHEN YOU GROW RESTLESS YOU SHALL BREAK HIS YOKE FROM YOUR NECK

 NOW ESAU HATED JACOB BECAUSE OF THE BLESSING WITH WHICH HIS FATHER HAD BLESSED HIM AND ESAU SAID TO HIMSELF THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER ARE APPROACHING; THEN I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB

 BUT THE WORDS OF ESAU HER OLDER SON WERE TOLD TO REBEKAH

SO SHE SENT AND CALLED JACOB HER YOUNGER SON AND SAID TO HIM BEHOLD YOUR BROTHER ESAU COMFORTS HIMSELF ABOUT YOU BY PLANNING TO KILL YOU

NOW THEREFORE MY SON OBEY MY VOICE

ARISE FLEE TO LABAN MY BROTHER IN HARAN AND STAY WITH HIM A WHILE UNTIL YOUR BROTHER'S FURY TURNS AWAY UNTIL YOUR BROTHER'S ANGER TURNS AWAY FROM YOU AND HE FORGETS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO HIM

THEN I WILL SEND AND BRING YOU FROM THERE

WHY SHOULD I BE BEREFT OF YOU BOTH IN ONE DAY

 THEN REBEKAH SAID TO ISAAC I LOATHE MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THE HITTITE WOMEN

IF JACOB MARRIES ONE OF THE HITTITE WOMEN LIKE THESE ONE OF THE WOMEN OF THE LAND WHAT GOOD WILL MY LIFE BE TO ME

THEN ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM AND DIRECTED HIM YOU MUST NOT TAKE A WIFE FROM THE CANAANITE WOMEN

ARISE GO TO PADDANARAM TO THE HOUSE OF BETHUEL YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER AND TAKE AS YOUR WIFE FROM THERE ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF LABAN YOUR MOTHER'S BROTHER

GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU AND MAKE YOU FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY YOU THAT YOU MAY BECOME A COMPANY OF PEOPLES

MAY HE GIVE THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING WITH YOU THAT YOU MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND OF YOUR SOJOURNINGS THAT GOD GAVE TO ABRAHAM

 THUS ISAAC SENT JACOB AWAY

AND HE WENT TO PADDANARAM TO LABAN THE SON OF BETHUEL THE ARAMEAN THE BROTHER OF REBEKAH JACOB'S AND ESAU'S MOTHER

NOW ESAU SAW THAT ISAAC HAD BLESSED JACOB AND SENT HIM AWAY TO PADDANARAM TO TAKE A WIFE FROM THERE AND THAT AS HE BLESSED HIM HE DIRECTED HIM YOU MUST NOT TAKE A WIFE FROM THE CANAANITE WOMEN AND THAT JACOB HAD OBEYED HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND GONE TO PADDANARAM

SO WHEN ESAU SAW THAT THE CANAANITE WOMEN DID NOT PLEASE ISAAC HIS FATHER ESAU WENT TO ISHMAEL AND TOOK AS HIS WIFE BESIDES THE WIVES HE HAD MAHALATH THE DAUGHTER OF ISHMAEL ABRAHAM'S SON THE SISTER OF NEBAIOTH

JACOB LEFT BEERSHEBA AND WENT TOWARD HARAN

AND HE CAME TO A CERTAIN PLACE AND STAYED THERE THAT NIGHT BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET

TAKING ONE OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE HE PUT IT UNDER HIS HEAD AND LAY DOWN IN THAT PLACE TO SLEEP

AND HE DREAMED AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH AND THE TOP OF IT REACHED TO HEAVEN

AND BEHOLD THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON IT

AND BEHOLD THE LORD STOOD ABOVE IT AND SAID I AM THE LORD THE GOD OF ABRAHAM YOUR FATHER AND THE GOD OF ISAAC

THE LAND ON WHICH YOU LIE I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING

YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH AND YOU SHALL SPREAD ABROAD TO THE WEST AND TO THE EAST AND TO THE NORTH AND TO THE SOUTH AND IN YOU AND YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED

BEHOLD I AM WITH YOU AND WILL KEEP YOU WHEREVER YOU GO AND WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THIS LAND

FOR I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNTIL I HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVE PROMISED YOU

 THEN JACOB AWOKE FROM HIS SLEEP AND SAID SURELY THE LORD IS IN THIS PLACE AND I DID NOT KNOW IT

 AND HE WAS AFRAID AND SAID HOW AWESOME IS THIS PLACE

THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THIS IS THE GATE OF HEAVEN

 SO EARLY IN THE MORNING JACOB TOOK THE STONE THAT HE HAD PUT UNDER HIS HEAD AND SET IT UP FOR A PILLAR AND POURED OIL ON THE TOP OF IT

HE CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE BETHEL BUT THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS LUZ AT THE FIRST

THEN JACOB MADE A VOW SAYING IF GOD WILL BE WITH ME AND WILL KEEP ME IN THIS WAY THAT I GO AND WILL GIVE ME BREAD TO EAT AND CLOTHING TO WEAR SO THAT I COME AGAIN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE IN PEACE THEN THE LORD SHALL BE MY GOD AND THIS STONE WHICH I HAVE SET UP FOR A PILLAR SHALL BE GOD'S HOUSE

AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME I WILL GIVE A FULL TENTH TO YOU

THEN JACOB WENT ON HIS JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE LAND OF THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST

AS HE LOOKED HE SAW A WELL IN THE FIELD AND BEHOLD THREE FLOCKS OF SHEEP LYING BESIDE IT FOR OUT OF THAT WELL THE FLOCKS WERE WATERED

THE STONE ON THE WELL'S MOUTH WAS LARGE AND WHEN ALL THE FLOCKS WERE GATHERED THERE THE SHEPHERDS WOULD ROLL THE STONE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE WELL AND WATER THE SHEEP AND PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE OVER THE MOUTH OF THE WELL

JACOB SAID TO THEM MY BROTHERS WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 THEY SAID WE ARE FROM HARAN

 HE SAID TO THEM DO YOU KNOW LABAN THE SON OF NAHOR

 THEY SAID WE KNOW HIM

 HE SAID TO THEM IS IT WELL WITH HIM

 THEY SAID IT IS WELL; AND SEE RACHEL HIS DAUGHTER IS COMING WITH THE SHEEP

 HE SAID BEHOLD IT IS STILL HIGH DAY; IT IS NOT TIME FOR THE LIVESTOCK TO BE GATHERED TOGETHER

WATER THE SHEEP AND GO PASTURE THEM

 BUT THEY SAID WE CANNOT UNTIL ALL THE FLOCKS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND THE STONE IS ROLLED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE WELL; THEN WE WATER THE SHEEP

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING WITH THEM RACHEL CAME WITH HER FATHER'S SHEEP FOR SHE WAS A SHEPHERDESS

NOW AS SOON AS JACOB SAW RACHEL THE DAUGHTER OF LABAN HIS MOTHER'S BROTHER AND THE SHEEP OF LABAN HIS MOTHER'S BROTHER JACOB CAME NEAR AND ROLLED THE STONE FROM THE WELL'S MOUTH AND WATERED THE FLOCK OF LABAN HIS MOTHER'S BROTHER

THEN JACOB KISSED RACHEL AND WEPT ALOUD

AND JACOB TOLD RACHEL THAT HE WAS HER FATHER'S KINSMAN AND THAT HE WAS REBEKAH'S SON AND SHE RAN AND TOLD HER FATHER

AS SOON AS LABAN HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT JACOB HIS SISTER'S SON HE RAN TO MEET HIM AND EMBRACED HIM AND KISSED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE

JACOB TOLD LABAN ALL THESE THINGS AND LABAN SAID TO HIM SURELY YOU ARE MY BONE AND MY FLESH

 AND HE STAYED WITH HIM A MONTH

THEN LABAN SAID TO JACOB BECAUSE YOU ARE MY KINSMAN SHOULD YOU THEREFORE SERVE ME FOR NOTHING

TELL ME WHAT SHALL YOUR WAGES BE

 NOW LABAN HAD TWO DAUGHTERS

THE NAME OF THE OLDER WAS LEAH AND THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER WAS RACHEL

LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK BUT RACHEL WAS BEAUTIFUL IN FORM AND APPEARANCE

JACOB LOVED RACHEL

AND HE SAID I WILL SERVE YOU SEVEN YEARS FOR YOUR YOUNGER DAUGHTER RACHEL

 LABAN SAID IT IS BETTER THAT I GIVE HER TO YOU THAN THAT I SHOULD GIVE HER TO ANY OTHER MAN; STAY WITH ME

 SO JACOB SERVED SEVEN YEARS FOR RACHEL AND THEY SEEMED TO HIM BUT A FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE LOVE HE HAD FOR HER

THEN JACOB SAID TO LABAN GIVE ME MY WIFE THAT I MAY GO IN TO HER FOR MY TIME IS COMPLETED

 SO LABAN GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND MADE A FEAST

BUT IN THE EVENING HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER LEAH AND BROUGHT HER TO JACOB AND HE WENT IN TO HER

LABAN GAVE HIS FEMALE SERVANT ZILPAH TO HIS DAUGHTER LEAH TO BE HER SERVANT

 AND IN THE MORNING BEHOLD IT WAS LEAH

AND JACOB SAID TO LABAN WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE TO ME

DID I NOT SERVE WITH YOU FOR RACHEL

WHY THEN HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME

 LABAN SAID IT IS NOT SO DONE IN OUR COUNTRY TO GIVE THE YOUNGER BEFORE THE FIRSTBORN

COMPLETE THE WEEK OF THIS ONE AND WE WILL GIVE YOU THE OTHER ALSO IN RETURN FOR SERVING ME ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS

 JACOB DID SO AND COMPLETED HER WEEK

THEN LABAN GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER RACHEL TO BE HIS WIFE

LABAN GAVE HIS FEMALE SERVANT BILHAH TO HIS DAUGHTER RACHEL TO BE HER SERVANT

 SO JACOB WENT IN TO RACHEL ALSO AND HE LOVED RACHEL MORE THAN LEAH AND SERVED LABAN FOR ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS

WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED HE OPENED HER WOMB BUT RACHEL WAS BARREN

AND LEAH CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME REUBEN FOR SHE SAID BECAUSE THE LORD HAS LOOKED UPON MY AFFLICTION; FOR NOW MY HUSBAND WILL LOVE ME

 SHE CONCEIVED AGAIN AND BORE A SON AND SAID BECAUSE THE LORD HAS HEARD THAT I AM HATED HE HAS GIVEN ME THIS SON ALSO

 AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME SIMEON

AGAIN SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND SAID NOW THIS TIME MY HUSBAND WILL BE ATTACHED TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE BORNE HIM THREE SONS

 THEREFORE HIS NAME WAS CALLED LEVI

AND SHE CONCEIVED AGAIN AND BORE A SON AND SAID THIS TIME I WILL PRAISE THE LORD

 THEREFORE SHE CALLED HIS NAME JUDAH

THEN SHE CEASED BEARING

WHEN RACHEL SAW THAT SHE BORE JACOB NO CHILDREN SHE ENVIED HER SISTER

SHE SAID TO JACOB GIVE ME CHILDREN OR I SHALL DIE

 JACOB'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST RACHEL AND HE SAID AM I IN THE PLACE OF GOD WHO HAS WITHHELD FROM YOU THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB

 THEN SHE SAID HERE IS MY SERVANT BILHAH; GO IN TO HER SO THAT SHE MAY GIVE BIRTH ON MY BEHALF THAT EVEN I MAY HAVE CHILDREN THROUGH HER

 SO SHE GAVE HIM HER SERVANT BILHAH AS A WIFE AND JACOB WENT IN TO HER

AND BILHAH CONCEIVED AND BORE JACOB A SON

THEN RACHEL SAID GOD HAS JUDGED ME AND HAS ALSO HEARD MY VOICE AND GIVEN ME A SON

 THEREFORE SHE CALLED HIS NAME DAN

RACHEL'S SERVANT BILHAH CONCEIVED AGAIN AND BORE JACOB A SECOND SON

THEN RACHEL SAID WITH MIGHTY WRESTLINGS I HAVE WRESTLED WITH MY SISTER AND HAVE PREVAILED

 SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME NAPHTALI

WHEN LEAH SAW THAT SHE HAD CEASED BEARING CHILDREN SHE TOOK HER SERVANT ZILPAH AND GAVE HER TO JACOB AS A WIFE

THEN LEAH'S SERVANT ZILPAH BORE JACOB A SON

AND LEAH SAID GOOD FORTUNE HAS COME

 SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME GAD

LEAH'S SERVANT ZILPAH BORE JACOB A SECOND SON

AND LEAH SAID HAPPY AM I

FOR WOMEN HAVE CALLED ME HAPPY

 SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME ASHER

IN THE DAYS OF WHEAT HARVEST REUBEN WENT AND FOUND MANDRAKES IN THE FIELD AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIS MOTHER LEAH

THEN RACHEL SAID TO LEAH PLEASE GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR SON'S MANDRAKES

 BUT SHE SAID TO HER IS IT A SMALL MATTER THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY HUSBAND

WOULD YOU TAKE AWAY MY SON'S MANDRAKES ALSO

 RACHEL SAID THEN HE MAY LIE WITH YOU TONIGHT IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR SON'S MANDRAKES

 WHEN JACOB CAME FROM THE FIELD IN THE EVENING LEAH WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SAID YOU MUST COME IN TO ME FOR I HAVE HIRED YOU WITH MY SON'S MANDRAKES

 SO HE LAY WITH HER THAT NIGHT

AND GOD LISTENED TO LEAH AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE JACOB A FIFTH SON

LEAH SAID GOD HAS GIVEN ME MY WAGES BECAUSE I GAVE MY SERVANT TO MY HUSBAND

 SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME ISSACHAR

AND LEAH CONCEIVED AGAIN AND SHE BORE JACOB A SIXTH SON

THEN LEAH SAID GOD HAS ENDOWED ME WITH A GOOD ENDOWMENT; NOW MY HUSBAND WILL HONOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BORNE HIM SIX SONS

 SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME ZEBULUN

AFTERWARD SHE BORE A DAUGHTER AND CALLED HER NAME DINAH

THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL AND GOD LISTENED TO HER AND OPENED HER WOMB

SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND SAID GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY REPROACH

 AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME JOSEPH SAYING MAY THE LORD ADD TO ME ANOTHER SON

 AS SOON AS RACHEL HAD BORNE JOSEPH JACOB SAID TO LABAN SEND ME AWAY THAT I MAY GO TO MY OWN HOME AND COUNTRY

GIVE ME MY WIVES AND MY CHILDREN FOR WHOM I HAVE SERVED YOU THAT I MAY GO FOR YOU KNOW THE SERVICE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU

 BUT LABAN SAID TO HIM IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME BECAUSE OF YOU

NAME YOUR WAGES AND I WILL GIVE IT

 JACOB SAID TO HIM YOU YOURSELF KNOW HOW I HAVE SERVED YOU AND HOW YOUR LIVESTOCK HAS FARED WITH ME

FOR YOU HAD LITTLE BEFORE I CAME AND IT HAS INCREASED ABUNDANTLY AND THE LORD HAS BLESSED YOU WHEREVER I TURNED

BUT NOW WHEN SHALL I PROVIDE FOR MY OWN HOUSEHOLD ALSO

 HE SAID WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU

 JACOB SAID YOU SHALL NOT GIVE ME ANYTHING

IF YOU WILL DO THIS FOR ME I WILL AGAIN PASTURE YOUR FLOCK AND KEEP IT LET ME PASS THROUGH ALL YOUR FLOCK TODAY REMOVING FROM IT EVERY SPECKLED AND SPOTTED SHEEP AND EVERY BLACK LAMB AND THE SPOTTED AND SPECKLED AMONG THE GOATS AND THEY SHALL BE MY WAGES

SO MY HONESTY WILL ANSWER FOR ME LATER WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK INTO MY WAGES WITH YOU

EVERY ONE THAT IS NOT SPECKLED AND SPOTTED AMONG THE GOATS AND BLACK AMONG THE LAMBS IF FOUND WITH ME SHALL BE COUNTED STOLEN

 LABAN SAID GOOD

LET IT BE AS YOU HAVE SAID

 BUT THAT DAY LABAN REMOVED THE MALE GOATS THAT WERE STRIPED AND SPOTTED AND ALL THE FEMALE GOATS THAT WERE SPECKLED AND SPOTTED EVERY ONE THAT HAD WHITE ON IT AND EVERY LAMB THAT WAS BLACK AND PUT THEM IN CHARGE OF HIS SONS

AND HE SET A DISTANCE OF THREE DAYS' JOURNEY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JACOB AND JACOB PASTURED THE REST OF LABAN'S FLOCK

THEN JACOB TOOK FRESH STICKS OF POPLAR AND ALMOND AND PLANE TREES AND PEELED WHITE STREAKS IN THEM EXPOSING THE WHITE OF THE STICKS

HE SET THE STICKS THAT HE HAD PEELED IN FRONT OF THE FLOCKS IN THE TROUGHS THAT IS THE WATERING PLACES WHERE THE FLOCKS CAME TO DRINK

AND SINCE THEY BRED WHEN THEY CAME TO DRINK THE FLOCKS BRED IN FRONT OF THE STICKS AND SO THE FLOCKS BROUGHT FORTH STRIPED SPECKLED AND SPOTTED

AND JACOB SEPARATED THE LAMBS AND SET THE FACES OF THE FLOCKS TOWARD THE STRIPED AND ALL THE BLACK IN THE FLOCK OF LABAN

HE PUT HIS OWN DROVES APART AND DID NOT PUT THEM WITH LABAN'S FLOCK

WHENEVER THE STRONGER OF THE FLOCK WERE BREEDING JACOB WOULD LAY THE STICKS IN THE TROUGHS BEFORE THE EYES OF THE FLOCK THAT THEY MIGHT BREED AMONG THE STICKS BUT FOR THE FEEBLER OF THE FLOCK HE WOULD NOT LAY THEM THERE

SO THE FEEBLER WOULD BE LABAN'S AND THE STRONGER JACOB'S

THUS THE MAN INCREASED GREATLY AND HAD LARGE FLOCKS FEMALE SERVANTS AND MALE SERVANTS AND CAMELS AND DONKEYS

NOW JACOB HEARD THAT THE SONS OF LABAN WERE SAYING JACOB HAS TAKEN ALL THAT WAS OUR FATHER'S AND FROM WHAT WAS OUR FATHER'S HE HAS GAINED ALL THIS WEALTH

 AND JACOB SAW THAT LABAN DID NOT REGARD HIM WITH FAVOR AS BEFORE

THEN THE LORD SAID TO JACOB RETURN TO THE LAND OF YOUR FATHERS AND TO YOUR KINDRED AND I WILL BE WITH YOU

 SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH INTO THE FIELD WHERE HIS FLOCK WAS AND SAID TO THEM I SEE THAT YOUR FATHER DOES NOT REGARD ME WITH FAVOR AS HE DID BEFORE

BUT THE GOD OF MY FATHER HAS BEEN WITH ME

YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE SERVED YOUR FATHER WITH ALL MY STRENGTH YET YOUR FATHER HAS CHEATED ME AND CHANGED MY WAGES TEN TIMES

BUT GOD DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO HARM ME

IF HE SAID 'THE SPOTTED SHALL BE YOUR WAGES' THEN ALL THE FLOCK BORE SPOTTED; AND IF HE SAID 'THE STRIPED SHALL BE YOUR WAGES' THEN ALL THE FLOCK BORE STRIPED

THUS GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY THE LIVESTOCK OF YOUR FATHER AND GIVEN THEM TO ME

IN THE BREEDING SEASON OF THE FLOCK I LIFTED UP MY EYES AND SAW IN A DREAM THAT THE GOATS THAT MATED WITH THE FLOCK WERE STRIPED SPOTTED AND MOTTLED

THEN THE ANGEL OF GOD SAID TO ME IN THE DREAM 'JACOB' AND I SAID 'HERE I AM

' AND HE SAID 'LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND SEE ALL THE GOATS THAT MATE WITH THE FLOCK ARE STRIPED SPOTTED AND MOTTLED FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL THAT LABAN IS DOING TO YOU

I AM THE GOD OF BETHEL WHERE YOU ANOINTED A PILLAR AND MADE A VOW TO ME

NOW ARISE GO OUT FROM THIS LAND AND RETURN TO THE LAND OF YOUR KINDRED

' THEN RACHEL AND LEAH ANSWERED AND SAID TO HIM IS THERE ANY PORTION OR INHERITANCE LEFT TO US IN OUR FATHER'S HOUSE

ARE WE NOT REGARDED BY HIM AS FOREIGNERS

FOR HE HAS SOLD US AND HE HAS INDEED DEVOURED OUR MONEY

ALL THE WEALTH THAT GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY FROM OUR FATHER BELONGS TO US AND TO OUR CHILDREN

NOW THEN WHATEVER GOD HAS SAID TO YOU DO

 SO JACOB AROSE AND SET HIS SONS AND HIS WIVES ON CAMELS

HE DROVE AWAY ALL HIS LIVESTOCK ALL HIS PROPERTY THAT HE HAD GAINED THE LIVESTOCK IN HIS POSSESSION THAT HE HAD ACQUIRED IN PADDANARAM TO GO TO THE LAND OF CANAAN TO HIS FATHER ISAAC

LABAN HAD GONE TO SHEAR HIS SHEEP AND RACHEL STOLE HER FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD GODS

AND JACOB TRICKED LABAN THE ARAMEAN BY NOT TELLING HIM THAT HE INTENDED TO FLEE

HE FLED WITH ALL THAT HE HAD AND AROSE AND CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND SET HIS FACE TOWARD THE HILL COUNTRY OF GILEAD

WHEN IT WAS TOLD LABAN ON THE THIRD DAY THAT JACOB HAD FLED HE TOOK HIS KINSMEN WITH HIM AND PURSUED HIM FOR SEVEN DAYS AND FOLLOWED CLOSE AFTER HIM INTO THE HILL COUNTRY OF GILEAD

BUT GOD CAME TO LABAN THE ARAMEAN IN A DREAM BY NIGHT AND SAID TO HIM BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO JACOB EITHER GOOD OR BAD

 AND LABAN OVERTOOK JACOB

NOW JACOB HAD PITCHED HIS TENT IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND LABAN WITH HIS KINSMEN PITCHED TENTS IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF GILEAD

AND LABAN SAID TO JACOB WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT YOU HAVE TRICKED ME AND DRIVEN AWAY MY DAUGHTERS LIKE CAPTIVES OF THE SWORD

WHY DID YOU FLEE SECRETLY AND TRICK ME AND DID NOT TELL ME SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE SENT YOU AWAY WITH MIRTH AND SONGS WITH TAMBOURINE AND LYRE

AND WHY DID YOU NOT PERMIT ME TO KISS MY SONS AND MY DAUGHTERS FAREWELL

NOW YOU HAVE DONE FOOLISHLY

IT IS IN MY POWER TO DO YOU HARM

BUT THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER SPOKE TO ME LAST NIGHT SAYING 'BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO JACOB EITHER GOOD OR BAD

' AND NOW YOU HAVE GONE AWAY BECAUSE YOU LONGED GREATLY FOR YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE BUT WHY DID YOU STEAL MY GODS

 JACOB ANSWERED AND SAID TO LABAN BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID FOR I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS FROM ME BY FORCE

ANYONE WITH WHOM YOU FIND YOUR GODS SHALL NOT LIVE

IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR KINSMEN POINT OUT WHAT I HAVE THAT IS YOURS AND TAKE IT

 NOW JACOB DID NOT KNOW THAT RACHEL HAD STOLEN THEM

SO LABAN WENT INTO JACOB'S TENT AND INTO LEAH'S TENT AND INTO THE TENT OF THE TWO FEMALE SERVANTS BUT HE DID NOT FIND THEM

AND HE WENT OUT OF LEAH'S TENT AND ENTERED RACHEL'S

NOW RACHEL HAD TAKEN THE HOUSEHOLD GODS AND PUT THEM IN THE CAMEL'S SADDLE AND SAT ON THEM

LABAN FELT ALL ABOUT THE TENT BUT DID NOT FIND THEM

AND SHE SAID TO HER FATHER LET NOT MY LORD BE ANGRY THAT I CANNOT RISE BEFORE YOU FOR THE WAY OF WOMEN IS UPON ME

 SO HE SEARCHED BUT DID NOT FIND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS

THEN JACOB BECAME ANGRY AND BERATED LABAN

JACOB SAID TO LABAN WHAT IS MY OFFENSE

WHAT IS MY SIN THAT YOU HAVE HOTLY PURSUED ME

FOR YOU HAVE FELT THROUGH ALL MY GOODS; WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OF ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD GOODS

SET IT HERE BEFORE MY KINSMEN AND YOUR KINSMEN THAT THEY MAY DECIDE BETWEEN US TWO

THESE TWENTY YEARS I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU

YOUR EWES AND YOUR FEMALE GOATS HAVE NOT MISCARRIED AND I HAVE NOT EATEN THE RAMS OF YOUR FLOCKS

WHAT WAS TORN BY WILD BEASTS I DID NOT BRING TO YOU

I BORE THE LOSS OF IT MYSELF

FROM MY HAND YOU REQUIRED IT WHETHER STOLEN BY DAY OR STOLEN BY NIGHT

THERE I WAS BY DAY THE HEAT CONSUMED ME AND THE COLD BY NIGHT AND MY SLEEP FLED FROM MY EYES

THESE TWENTY YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR HOUSE

I SERVED YOU FOURTEEN YEARS FOR YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS AND SIX YEARS FOR YOUR FLOCK AND YOU HAVE CHANGED MY WAGES TEN TIMES

IF THE GOD OF MY FATHER THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE FEAR OF ISAAC HAD NOT BEEN ON MY SIDE SURELY NOW YOU WOULD HAVE SENT ME AWAY EMPTYHANDED

GOD SAW MY AFFLICTION AND THE LABOR OF MY HANDS AND REBUKED YOU LAST NIGHT

 THEN LABAN ANSWERED AND SAID TO JACOB THE DAUGHTERS ARE MY DAUGHTERS THE CHILDREN ARE MY CHILDREN THE FLOCKS ARE MY FLOCKS AND ALL THAT YOU SEE IS MINE

BUT WHAT CAN I DO THIS DAY FOR THESE MY DAUGHTERS OR FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHOM THEY HAVE BORNE

COME NOW LET US MAKE A COVENANT YOU AND I

AND LET IT BE A WITNESS BETWEEN YOU AND ME

 SO JACOB TOOK A STONE AND SET IT UP AS A PILLAR

AND JACOB SAID TO HIS KINSMEN GATHER STONES

 AND THEY TOOK STONES AND MADE A HEAP AND THEY ATE THERE BY THE HEAP

LABAN CALLED IT JEGARSAHADUTHA BUT JACOB CALLED IT GALEED

LABAN SAID THIS HEAP IS A WITNESS BETWEEN YOU AND ME TODAY

 THEREFORE HE NAMED IT GALEED AND MIZPAH FOR HE SAID THE LORD WATCH BETWEEN YOU AND ME WHEN WE ARE OUT OF ONE ANOTHER'S SIGHT

IF YOU OPPRESS MY DAUGHTERS OR IF YOU TAKE WIVES BESIDES MY DAUGHTERS ALTHOUGH NO ONE IS WITH US SEE GOD IS WITNESS BETWEEN YOU AND ME

 THEN LABAN SAID TO JACOB SEE THIS HEAP AND THE PILLAR WHICH I HAVE SET BETWEEN YOU AND ME

THIS HEAP IS A WITNESS AND THE PILLAR IS A WITNESS THAT I WILL NOT PASS OVER THIS HEAP TO YOU AND YOU WILL NOT PASS OVER THIS HEAP AND THIS PILLAR TO ME TO DO HARM

THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF NAHOR THE GOD OF THEIR FATHER JUDGE BETWEEN US

 SO JACOB SWORE BY THE FEAR OF HIS FATHER ISAAC AND JACOB OFFERED A SACRIFICE IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND CALLED HIS KINSMEN TO EAT BREAD

THEY ATE BREAD AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HILL COUNTRY

EARLY IN THE MORNING LABAN AROSE AND KISSED HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND HIS DAUGHTERS AND BLESSED THEM

THEN LABAN DEPARTED AND RETURNED HOME

JACOB WENT ON HIS WAY AND THE ANGELS OF GOD MET HIM

AND WHEN JACOB SAW THEM HE SAID THIS IS GOD'S CAMP

 SO HE CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE MAHANAIM

AND JACOB SENT MESSENGERS BEFORE HIM TO ESAU HIS BROTHER IN THE LAND OF SEIR THE COUNTRY OF EDOM INSTRUCTING THEM THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO MY LORD ESAU THUS SAYS YOUR SERVANT JACOB 'I HAVE SOJOURNED WITH LABAN AND STAYED UNTIL NOW

I HAVE OXEN DONKEYS FLOCKS MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS

I HAVE SENT TO TELL MY LORD IN ORDER THAT I MAY FIND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT

' AND THE MESSENGERS RETURNED TO JACOB SAYING WE CAME TO YOUR BROTHER ESAU AND HE IS COMING TO MEET YOU AND THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM

 THEN JACOB WAS GREATLY AFRAID AND DISTRESSED

HE DIVIDED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND THE FLOCKS AND HERDS AND CAMELS INTO TWO CAMPS THINKING IF ESAU COMES TO THE ONE CAMP AND ATTACKS IT THEN THE CAMP THAT IS LEFT WILL ESCAPE

 AND JACOB SAID O GOD OF MY FATHER ABRAHAM AND GOD OF MY FATHER ISAAC O LORD WHO SAID TO ME 'RETURN TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO YOUR KINDRED THAT I MAY DO YOU GOOD' I AM NOT WORTHY OF THE LEAST OF ALL THE DEEDS OF STEADFAST LOVE AND ALL THE FAITHFULNESS THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN TO YOUR SERVANT FOR WITH ONLY MY STAFF I CROSSED THIS JORDAN AND NOW I HAVE BECOME TWO CAMPS

PLEASE DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF MY BROTHER FROM THE HAND OF ESAU FOR I FEAR HIM THAT HE MAY COME AND ATTACK ME THE MOTHERS WITH THE CHILDREN

BUT YOU SAID 'I WILL SURELY DO YOU GOOD AND MAKE YOUR OFFSPRING AS THE SAND OF THE SEA WHICH CANNOT BE NUMBERED FOR MULTITUDE

' SO HE STAYED THERE THAT NIGHT AND FROM WHAT HE HAD WITH HIM HE TOOK A PRESENT FOR HIS BROTHER ESAU TWO HUNDRED FEMALE GOATS AND TWENTY MALE GOATS TWO HUNDRED EWES AND TWENTY RAMS THIRTY MILKING CAMELS AND THEIR CALVES FORTY COWS AND TEN BULLS TWENTY FEMALE DONKEYS AND TEN MALE DONKEYS

THESE HE HANDED OVER TO HIS SERVANTS EVERY DROVE BY ITSELF AND SAID TO HIS SERVANTS PASS ON AHEAD OF ME AND PUT A SPACE BETWEEN DROVE AND DROVE

 HE INSTRUCTED THE FIRST WHEN ESAU MY BROTHER MEETS YOU AND ASKS YOU 'TO WHOM DO YOU BELONG

WHERE ARE YOU GOING

AND WHOSE ARE THESE AHEAD OF YOU

' THEN YOU SHALL SAY 'THEY BELONG TO YOUR SERVANT JACOB

THEY ARE A PRESENT SENT TO MY LORD ESAU

AND MOREOVER HE IS BEHIND US

' HE LIKEWISE INSTRUCTED THE SECOND AND THE THIRD AND ALL WHO FOLLOWED THE DROVES YOU SHALL SAY THE SAME THING TO ESAU WHEN YOU FIND HIM AND YOU SHALL SAY 'MOREOVER YOUR SERVANT JACOB IS BEHIND US

' FOR HE THOUGHT I MAY APPEASE HIM WITH THE PRESENT THAT GOES AHEAD OF ME AND AFTERWARD I SHALL SEE HIS FACE

PERHAPS HE WILL ACCEPT ME

 SO THE PRESENT PASSED ON AHEAD OF HIM AND HE HIMSELF STAYED THAT NIGHT IN THE CAMP

THE SAME NIGHT HE AROSE AND TOOK HIS TWO WIVES HIS TWO FEMALE SERVANTS AND HIS ELEVEN CHILDREN AND CROSSED THE FORD OF THE JABBOK

HE TOOK THEM AND SENT THEM ACROSS THE STREAM AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE HAD

AND JACOB WAS LEFT ALONE

AND A MAN WRESTLED WITH HIM UNTIL THE BREAKING OF THE DAY

WHEN THE MAN SAW THAT HE DID NOT PREVAIL AGAINST JACOB HE TOUCHED HIS HIP SOCKET AND JACOB'S HIP WAS PUT OUT OF JOINT AS HE WRESTLED WITH HIM

THEN HE SAID LET ME GO FOR THE DAY HAS BROKEN

 BUT JACOB SAID I WILL NOT LET YOU GO UNLESS YOU BLESS ME

 AND HE SAID TO HIM WHAT IS YOUR NAME

 AND HE SAID JACOB

 THEN HE SAID YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE CALLED JACOB BUT ISRAEL FOR YOU HAVE STRIVEN WITH GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAVE PREVAILED

 THEN JACOB ASKED HIM PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME

 BUT HE SAID WHY IS IT THAT YOU ASK MY NAME

 AND THERE HE BLESSED HIM

SO JACOB CALLED THE NAME OF THE PLACE PENIEL SAYING FOR I HAVE SEEN GOD FACE TO FACE AND YET MY LIFE HAS BEEN DELIVERED

 THE SUN ROSE UPON HIM AS HE PASSED PENUEL LIMPING BECAUSE OF HIS HIP

THEREFORE TO THIS DAY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DO NOT EAT THE SINEW OF THE THIGH THAT IS ON THE HIP SOCKET BECAUSE HE TOUCHED THE SOCKET OF JACOB'S HIP ON THE SINEW OF THE THIGH

AND JACOB LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD ESAU WAS COMING AND FOUR HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM

SO HE DIVIDED THE CHILDREN AMONG LEAH AND RACHEL AND THE TWO FEMALE SERVANTS

AND HE PUT THE SERVANTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN IN FRONT THEN LEAH WITH HER CHILDREN AND RACHEL AND JOSEPH LAST OF ALL

HE HIMSELF WENT ON BEFORE THEM BOWING HIMSELF TO THE GROUND SEVEN TIMES UNTIL HE CAME NEAR TO HIS BROTHER

BUT ESAU RAN TO MEET HIM AND EMBRACED HIM AND FELL ON HIS NECK AND KISSED HIM AND THEY WEPT

AND WHEN ESAU LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HE SAID WHO ARE THESE WITH YOU

 JACOB SAID THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GRACIOUSLY GIVEN YOUR SERVANT

 THEN THE SERVANTS DREW NEAR THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN AND BOWED DOWN

LEAH LIKEWISE AND HER CHILDREN DREW NEAR AND BOWED DOWN

AND LAST JOSEPH AND RACHEL DREW NEAR AND THEY BOWED DOWN

ESAU SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ALL THIS COMPANY THAT I MET

 JACOB ANSWERED TO FIND FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF MY LORD

 BUT ESAU SAID I HAVE ENOUGH MY BROTHER; KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE FOR YOURSELF

 JACOB SAID NO PLEASE IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT THEN ACCEPT MY PRESENT FROM MY HAND

FOR I HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE WHICH IS LIKE SEEING THE FACE OF GOD AND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED ME

PLEASE ACCEPT MY BLESSING THAT IS BROUGHT TO YOU BECAUSE GOD HAS DEALT GRACIOUSLY WITH ME AND BECAUSE I HAVE ENOUGH

 THUS HE URGED HIM AND HE TOOK IT

THEN ESAU SAID LET US JOURNEY ON OUR WAY AND I WILL GO AHEAD OF YOU

 BUT JACOB SAID TO HIM MY LORD KNOWS THAT THE CHILDREN ARE FRAIL AND THAT THE NURSING FLOCKS AND HERDS ARE A CARE TO ME

IF THEY ARE DRIVEN HARD FOR ONE DAY ALL THE FLOCKS WILL DIE

LET MY LORD PASS ON AHEAD OF HIS SERVANT AND I WILL LEAD ON SLOWLY AT THE PACE OF THE LIVESTOCK THAT ARE AHEAD OF ME AND AT THE PACE OF THE CHILDREN UNTIL I COME TO MY LORD IN SEIR

 SO ESAU SAID LET ME LEAVE WITH YOU SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH ME

 BUT HE SAID WHAT NEED IS THERE

LET ME FIND FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF MY LORD

 SO ESAU RETURNED THAT DAY ON HIS WAY TO SEIR

BUT JACOB JOURNEYED TO SUCCOTH AND BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE AND MADE BOOTHS FOR HIS LIVESTOCK

THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE PLACE IS CALLED SUCCOTH

AND JACOB CAME SAFELY TO THE CITY OF SHECHEM WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN ON HIS WAY FROM PADDANARAM AND HE CAMPED BEFORE THE CITY

AND FROM THE SONS OF HAMOR SHECHEM'S FATHER HE BOUGHT FOR A HUNDRED PIECES OF MONEY THE PIECE OF LAND ON WHICH HE HAD PITCHED HIS TENT

THERE HE ERECTED AN ALTAR AND CALLED IT ELELOHEISRAEL

NOW DINAH THE DAUGHTER OF LEAH WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB WENT OUT TO SEE THE WOMEN OF THE LAND

AND WHEN SHECHEM THE SON OF HAMOR THE HIVITE THE PRINCE OF THE LAND SAW HER HE SEIZED HER AND LAY WITH HER AND HUMILIATED HER

AND HIS SOUL WAS DRAWN TO DINAH THE DAUGHTER OF JACOB

HE LOVED THE YOUNG WOMAN AND SPOKE TENDERLY TO HER

SO SHECHEM SPOKE TO HIS FATHER HAMOR SAYING GET ME THIS GIRL FOR MY WIFE

 NOW JACOB HEARD THAT HE HAD DEFILED HIS DAUGHTER DINAH

BUT HIS SONS WERE WITH HIS LIVESTOCK IN THE FIELD SO JACOB HELD HIS PEACE UNTIL THEY CAME

AND HAMOR THE FATHER OF SHECHEM WENT OUT TO JACOB TO SPEAK WITH HIM

THE SONS OF JACOB HAD COME IN FROM THE FIELD AS SOON AS THEY HEARD OF IT AND THE MEN WERE INDIGNANT AND VERY ANGRY BECAUSE HE HAD DONE AN OUTRAGEOUS THING IN ISRAEL BY LYING WITH JACOB'S DAUGHTER FOR SUCH A THING MUST NOT BE DONE

BUT HAMOR SPOKE WITH THEM SAYING THE SOUL OF MY SON SHECHEM LONGS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER

PLEASE GIVE HER TO HIM TO BE HIS WIFE

MAKE MARRIAGES WITH US

GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO US AND TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS FOR YOURSELVES

YOU SHALL DWELL WITH US AND THE LAND SHALL BE OPEN TO YOU

DWELL AND TRADE IN IT AND GET PROPERTY IN IT

 SHECHEM ALSO SAID TO HER FATHER AND TO HER BROTHERS LET ME FIND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES AND WHATEVER YOU SAY TO ME I WILL GIVE

ASK ME FOR AS GREAT A BRIDE PRICE AND GIFT AS YOU WILL AND I WILL GIVE WHATEVER YOU SAY TO ME

ONLY GIVE ME THE YOUNG WOMAN TO BE MY WIFE

 THE SONS OF JACOB ANSWERED SHECHEM AND HIS FATHER HAMOR DECEITFULLY BECAUSE HE HAD DEFILED THEIR SISTER DINAH

THEY SAID TO THEM WE CANNOT DO THIS THING TO GIVE OUR SISTER TO ONE WHO IS UNCIRCUMCISED FOR THAT WOULD BE A DISGRACE TO US

ONLY ON THIS CONDITION WILL WE AGREE WITH YOUTHAT YOU WILL BECOME AS WE ARE BY EVERY MALE AMONG YOU BEING CIRCUMCISED

THEN WE WILL GIVE OUR DAUGHTERS TO YOU AND WE WILL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO OURSELVES AND WE WILL DWELL WITH YOU AND BECOME ONE PEOPLE

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO US AND BE CIRCUMCISED THEN WE WILL TAKE OUR DAUGHTER AND WE WILL BE GONE

 THEIR WORDS PLEASED HAMOR AND HAMOR'S SON SHECHEM

AND THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT DELAY TO DO THE THING BECAUSE HE DELIGHTED IN JACOB'S DAUGHTER

NOW HE WAS THE MOST HONORED OF ALL HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

SO HAMOR AND HIS SON SHECHEM CAME TO THE GATE OF THEIR CITY AND SPOKE TO THE MEN OF THEIR CITY SAYING THESE MEN ARE AT PEACE WITH US; LET THEM DWELL IN THE LAND AND TRADE IN IT FOR BEHOLD THE LAND IS LARGE ENOUGH FOR THEM

LET US TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS AS WIVES AND LET US GIVE THEM OUR DAUGHTERS

ONLY ON THIS CONDITION WILL THE MEN AGREE TO DWELL WITH US TO BECOME ONE PEOPLEWHEN EVERY MALE AMONG US IS CIRCUMCISED AS THEY ARE CIRCUMCISED

WILL NOT THEIR LIVESTOCK THEIR PROPERTY AND ALL THEIR BEASTS BE OURS

ONLY LET US AGREE WITH THEM AND THEY WILL DWELL WITH US

 AND ALL WHO WENT OUT OF THE GATE OF HIS CITY LISTENED TO HAMOR AND HIS SON SHECHEM AND EVERY MALE WAS CIRCUMCISED ALL WHO WENT OUT OF THE GATE OF HIS CITY

ON THE THIRD DAY WHEN THEY WERE SORE TWO OF THE SONS OF JACOB SIMEON AND LEVI DINAH'S BROTHERS TOOK THEIR SWORDS AND CAME AGAINST THE CITY WHILE IT FELT SECURE AND KILLED ALL THE MALES

THEY KILLED HAMOR AND HIS SON SHECHEM WITH THE SWORD AND TOOK DINAH OUT OF SHECHEM'S HOUSE AND WENT AWAY

THE SONS OF JACOB CAME UPON THE SLAIN AND PLUNDERED THE CITY BECAUSE THEY HAD DEFILED THEIR SISTER

THEY TOOK THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR HERDS THEIR DONKEYS AND WHATEVER WAS IN THE CITY AND IN THE FIELD

ALL THEIR WEALTH ALL THEIR LITTLE ONES AND THEIR WIVES ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOUSES THEY CAPTURED AND PLUNDERED

THEN JACOB SAID TO SIMEON AND LEVI YOU HAVE BROUGHT TROUBLE ON ME BY MAKING ME STINK TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND THE CANAANITES AND THE PERIZZITES

MY NUMBERS ARE FEW AND IF THEY GATHER THEMSELVES AGAINST ME AND ATTACK ME I SHALL BE DESTROYED BOTH I AND MY HOUSEHOLD

 BUT THEY SAID SHOULD HE TREAT OUR SISTER LIKE A PROSTITUTE

GOD SAID TO JACOB ARISE GO UP TO BETHEL AND DWELL THERE

MAKE AN ALTAR THERE TO THE GOD WHO APPEARED TO YOU WHEN YOU FLED FROM YOUR BROTHER ESAU

 SO JACOB SAID TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND TO ALL WHO WERE WITH HIM PUT AWAY THE FOREIGN GODS THAT ARE AMONG YOU AND PURIFY YOURSELVES AND CHANGE YOUR GARMENTS

THEN LET US ARISE AND GO UP TO BETHEL SO THAT I MAY MAKE THERE AN ALTAR TO THE GOD WHO ANSWERS ME IN THE DAY OF MY DISTRESS AND HAS BEEN WITH ME WHEREVER I HAVE GONE

 SO THEY GAVE TO JACOB ALL THE FOREIGN GODS THAT THEY HAD AND THE RINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR EARS

JACOB HID THEM UNDER THE TEREBINTH TREE THAT WAS NEAR SHECHEM

AND AS THEY JOURNEYED A TERROR FROM GOD FELL UPON THE CITIES THAT WERE AROUND THEM SO THAT THEY DID NOT PURSUE THE SONS OF JACOB

AND JACOB CAME TO LUZ THAT IS BETHEL WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN HE AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND THERE HE BUILT AN ALTAR AND CALLED THE PLACE ELBETHEL BECAUSE THERE GOD HAD REVEALED HIMSELF TO HIM WHEN HE FLED FROM HIS BROTHER

AND DEBORAH REBEKAH'S NURSE DIED AND SHE WAS BURIED UNDER AN OAK BELOW BETHEL

SO HE CALLED ITS NAME ALLONBACUTH

GOD APPEARED TO JACOB AGAIN WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDANARAM AND BLESSED HIM

AND GOD SAID TO HIM YOUR NAME IS JACOB; NO LONGER SHALL YOUR NAME BE CALLED JACOB BUT ISRAEL SHALL BE YOUR NAME

 SO HE CALLED HIS NAME ISRAEL

AND GOD SAID TO HIM I AM GOD ALMIGHTY BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY

A NATION AND A COMPANY OF NATIONS SHALL COME FROM YOU AND KINGS SHALL COME FROM YOUR OWN BODY

THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO ABRAHAM AND ISAAC I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND I WILL GIVE THE LAND TO YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU

 THEN GOD WENT UP FROM HIM IN THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM

AND JACOB SET UP A PILLAR IN THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM A PILLAR OF STONE

HE POURED OUT A DRINK OFFERING ON IT AND POURED OIL ON IT

SO JACOB CALLED THE NAME OF THE PLACE WHERE GOD HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM BETHEL

THEN THEY JOURNEYED FROM BETHEL

WHEN THEY WERE STILL SOME DISTANCE FROM EPHRATH RACHEL WENT INTO LABOR AND SHE HAD HARD LABOR

AND WHEN HER LABOR WAS AT ITS HARDEST THE MIDWIFE SAID TO HER DO NOT FEAR FOR YOU HAVE ANOTHER SON

 AND AS HER SOUL WAS DEPARTING FOR SHE WAS DYING SHE CALLED HIS NAME BENONI; BUT HIS FATHER CALLED HIM BENJAMIN

SO RACHEL DIED AND SHE WAS BURIED ON THE WAY TO EPHRATH THAT IS BETHLEHEM AND JACOB SET UP A PILLAR OVER HER TOMB

IT IS THE PILLAR OF RACHEL'S TOMB WHICH IS THERE TO THIS DAY

ISRAEL JOURNEYED ON AND PITCHED HIS TENT BEYOND THE TOWER OF EDER

WHILE ISRAEL LIVED IN THAT LAND REUBEN WENT AND LAY WITH BILHAH HIS FATHER'S CONCUBINE

AND JACOB CAME TO HIS FATHER ISAAC AT MAMRE OR KIRIATHARBA THAT IS HEBRON WHERE ABRAHAM AND ISAAC HAD SOJOURNED

NOW THE DAYS OF ISAAC WERE  YEARS

AND ISAAC BREATHED HIS LAST AND HE DIED AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE OLD AND FULL OF DAYS

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ESAU THAT IS EDOM

JACOB LIVED IN THE LAND OF HIS FATHER'S SOJOURNINGS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB

JOSEPH BEING SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD WAS PASTURING THE FLOCK WITH HIS BROTHERS

HE WAS A BOY WITH THE SONS OF BILHAH AND ZILPAH HIS FATHER'S WIVES

AND JOSEPH BROUGHT A BAD REPORT OF THEM TO THEIR FATHER

NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS SONS BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF HIS OLD AGE

AND HE MADE HIM A ROBE OF MANY COLORS

BUT WHEN HIS BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER LOVED HIM MORE THAN ALL HIS BROTHERS THEY HATED HIM AND COULD NOT SPEAK PEACEFULLY TO HIM

NOW JOSEPH HAD A DREAM AND WHEN HE TOLD IT TO HIS BROTHERS THEY HATED HIM EVEN MORE

HE SAID TO THEM HEAR THIS DREAM THAT I HAVE DREAMED BEHOLD WE WERE BINDING SHEAVES IN THE FIELD AND BEHOLD MY SHEAF AROSE AND STOOD UPRIGHT

AND BEHOLD YOUR SHEAVES GATHERED AROUND IT AND BOWED DOWN TO MY SHEAF

 HIS BROTHERS SAID TO HIM ARE YOU INDEED TO REIGN OVER US

OR ARE YOU INDEED TO RULE OVER US

 SO THEY HATED HIM EVEN MORE FOR HIS DREAMS AND FOR HIS WORDS

THEN HE DREAMED ANOTHER DREAM AND TOLD IT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SAID BEHOLD I HAVE DREAMED ANOTHER DREAM

BEHOLD THE SUN THE MOON AND ELEVEN STARS WERE BOWING DOWN TO ME

 BUT WHEN HE TOLD IT TO HIS FATHER AND TO HIS BROTHERS HIS FATHER REBUKED HIM AND SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THIS DREAM THAT YOU HAVE DREAMED

SHALL I AND YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHERS INDEED COME TO BOW OURSELVES TO THE GROUND BEFORE YOU

 AND HIS BROTHERS WERE JEALOUS OF HIM BUT HIS FATHER KEPT THE SAYING IN MIND

NOW HIS BROTHERS WENT TO PASTURE THEIR FATHER'S FLOCK NEAR SHECHEM

AND ISRAEL SAID TO JOSEPH ARE NOT YOUR BROTHERS PASTURING THE FLOCK AT SHECHEM

COME I WILL SEND YOU TO THEM

 AND HE SAID TO HIM HERE I AM

 SO HE SAID TO HIM GO NOW SEE IF IT IS WELL WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND WITH THE FLOCK AND BRING ME WORD

 SO HE SENT HIM FROM THE VALLEY OF HEBRON AND HE CAME TO SHECHEM

AND A MAN FOUND HIM WANDERING IN THE FIELDS

AND THE MAN ASKED HIM WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING

 I AM SEEKING MY BROTHERS HE SAID

TELL ME PLEASE WHERE THEY ARE PASTURING THE FLOCK

 AND THE MAN SAID THEY HAVE GONE AWAY FOR I HEARD THEM SAY 'LET US GO TO DOTHAN

' SO JOSEPH WENT AFTER HIS BROTHERS AND FOUND THEM AT DOTHAN

THEY SAW HIM FROM AFAR AND BEFORE HE CAME NEAR TO THEM THEY CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM TO KILL HIM

THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER HERE COMES THIS DREAMER

COME NOW LET US KILL HIM AND THROW HIM INTO ONE OF THE PITS

THEN WE WILL SAY THAT A FIERCE ANIMAL HAS DEVOURED HIM AND WE WILL SEE WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIS DREAMS

 BUT WHEN REUBEN HEARD IT HE RESCUED HIM OUT OF THEIR HANDS SAYING LET US NOT TAKE HIS LIFE

 AND REUBEN SAID TO THEM SHED NO BLOOD; CAST HIM INTO THIS PIT HERE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT DO NOT LAY A HAND ON HIMTHAT HE MIGHT RESCUE HIM OUT OF THEIR HAND TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS FATHER

SO WHEN JOSEPH CAME TO HIS BROTHERS THEY STRIPPED HIM OF HIS ROBE THE ROBE OF MANY COLORS THAT HE WORE

AND THEY TOOK HIM AND CAST HIM INTO A PIT

THE PIT WAS EMPTY; THERE WAS NO WATER IN IT

THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT

AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW A CARAVAN OF ISHMAELITES COMING FROM GILEAD WITH THEIR CAMELS BEARING GUM BALM AND MYRRH ON THEIR WAY TO CARRY IT DOWN TO EGYPT

THEN JUDAH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS WHAT PROFIT IS IT IF WE KILL OUR BROTHER AND CONCEAL HIS BLOOD

COME LET US SELL HIM TO THE ISHMAELITES AND LET NOT OUR HAND BE UPON HIM FOR HE IS OUR BROTHER OUR OWN FLESH

 AND HIS BROTHERS LISTENED TO HIM

THEN MIDIANITE TRADERS PASSED BY

AND THEY DREW JOSEPH UP AND LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE PIT AND SOLD HIM TO THE ISHMAELITES FOR TWENTY SHEKELS OF SILVER

THEY TOOK JOSEPH TO EGYPT

WHEN REUBEN RETURNED TO THE PIT AND SAW THAT JOSEPH WAS NOT IN THE PIT HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND RETURNED TO HIS BROTHERS AND SAID THE BOY IS GONE AND I WHERE SHALL I GO

 THEN THEY TOOK JOSEPH'S ROBE AND SLAUGHTERED A GOAT AND DIPPED THE ROBE IN THE BLOOD

AND THEY SENT THE ROBE OF MANY COLORS AND BROUGHT IT TO THEIR FATHER AND SAID THIS WE HAVE FOUND; PLEASE IDENTIFY WHETHER IT IS YOUR SON'S ROBE OR NOT

 AND HE IDENTIFIED IT AND SAID IT IS MY SON'S ROBE

A FIERCE ANIMAL HAS DEVOURED HIM

JOSEPH IS WITHOUT DOUBT TORN TO PIECES

 THEN JACOB TORE HIS GARMENTS AND PUT SACKCLOTH ON HIS LOINS AND MOURNED FOR HIS SON MANY DAYS

ALL HIS SONS AND ALL HIS DAUGHTERS ROSE UP TO COMFORT HIM BUT HE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED AND SAID NO I SHALL GO DOWN TO SHEOL TO MY SON MOURNING

 THUS HIS FATHER WEPT FOR HIM

MEANWHILE THE MIDIANITES HAD SOLD HIM IN EGYPT TO POTIPHAR AN OFFICER OF PHARAOH THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

IT HAPPENED AT THAT TIME THAT JUDAH WENT DOWN FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH

THERE JUDAH SAW THE DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN CANAANITE WHOSE NAME WAS SHUA

HE TOOK HER AND WENT IN TO HER AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND HE CALLED HIS NAME ER

SHE CONCEIVED AGAIN AND BORE A SON AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME ONAN

YET AGAIN SHE BORE A SON AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME SHELAH

JUDAH WAS IN CHEZIB WHEN SHE BORE HIM

AND JUDAH TOOK A WIFE FOR ER HIS FIRSTBORN AND HER NAME WAS TAMAR

BUT ER JUDAH'S FIRSTBORN WAS WICKED IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND THE LORD PUT HIM TO DEATH

THEN JUDAH SAID TO ONAN GO IN TO YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE AND PERFORM THE DUTY OF A BROTHERINLAW TO HER AND RAISE UP OFFSPRING FOR YOUR BROTHER

 BUT ONAN KNEW THAT THE OFFSPRING WOULD NOT BE HIS

SO WHENEVER HE WENT IN TO HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HE WOULD WASTE THE SEMEN ON THE GROUND SO AS NOT TO GIVE OFFSPRING TO HIS BROTHER

AND WHAT HE DID WAS WICKED IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND HE PUT HIM TO DEATH ALSO

THEN JUDAH SAID TO TAMAR HIS DAUGHTERINLAW REMAIN A WIDOW IN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE TILL SHELAH MY SON GROWS UPFOR HE FEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE LIKE HIS BROTHERS

SO TAMAR WENT AND REMAINED IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE

IN COURSE OF TIME THE WIFE OF JUDAH SHUA'S DAUGHTER DIED

WHEN JUDAH WAS COMFORTED HE WENT UP TO TIMNAH TO HIS SHEEPSHEARERS HE AND HIS FRIEND HIRAH THE ADULLAMITE

AND WHEN TAMAR WAS TOLD YOUR FATHERINLAW IS GOING UP TO TIMNAH TO SHEAR HIS SHEEP SHE TOOK OFF HER WIDOW'S GARMENTS AND COVERED HERSELF WITH A VEIL WRAPPING HERSELF UP AND SAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM WHICH IS ON THE ROAD TO TIMNAH

FOR SHE SAW THAT SHELAH WAS GROWN UP AND SHE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN TO HIM IN MARRIAGE

WHEN JUDAH SAW HER HE THOUGHT SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE FOR SHE HAD COVERED HER FACE

HE TURNED TO HER AT THE ROADSIDE AND SAID COME LET ME COME IN TO YOU FOR HE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS HIS DAUGHTERINLAW

SHE SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT YOU MAY COME IN TO ME

 HE ANSWERED I WILL SEND YOU A YOUNG GOAT FROM THE FLOCK

 AND SHE SAID IF YOU GIVE ME A PLEDGE UNTIL YOU SEND IT HE SAID WHAT PLEDGE SHALL I GIVE YOU

 SHE REPLIED YOUR SIGNET AND YOUR CORD AND YOUR STAFF THAT IS IN YOUR HAND

 SO HE GAVE THEM TO HER AND WENT IN TO HER AND SHE CONCEIVED BY HIM

THEN SHE AROSE AND WENT AWAY AND TAKING OFF HER VEIL SHE PUT ON THE GARMENTS OF HER WIDOWHOOD

WHEN JUDAH SENT THE YOUNG GOAT BY HIS FRIEND THE ADULLAMITE TO TAKE BACK THE PLEDGE FROM THE WOMAN'S HAND HE DID NOT FIND HER

AND HE ASKED THE MEN OF THE PLACE WHERE IS THE CULT PROSTITUTE WHO WAS AT ENAIM AT THE ROADSIDE

 AND THEY SAID NO CULT PROSTITUTE HAS BEEN HERE

 SO HE RETURNED TO JUDAH AND SAID I HAVE NOT FOUND HER

ALSO THE MEN OF THE PLACE SAID 'NO CULT PROSTITUTE HAS BEEN HERE

' AND JUDAH REPLIED LET HER KEEP THE THINGS AS HER OWN OR WE SHALL BE LAUGHED AT

YOU SEE I SENT THIS YOUNG GOAT AND YOU DID NOT FIND HER

 ABOUT THREE MONTHS LATER JUDAH WAS TOLD TAMAR YOUR DAUGHTERINLAW HAS BEEN IMMORAL

MOREOVER SHE IS PREGNANT BY IMMORALITY

 AND JUDAH SAID BRING HER OUT AND LET HER BE BURNED

 AS SHE WAS BEING BROUGHT OUT SHE SENT WORD TO HER FATHERINLAW BY THE MAN TO WHOM THESE BELONG I AM PREGNANT

 AND SHE SAID PLEASE IDENTIFY WHOSE THESE ARE THE SIGNET AND THE CORD AND THE STAFF

 THEN JUDAH IDENTIFIED THEM AND SAID SHE IS MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN I SINCE I DID NOT GIVE HER TO MY SON SHELAH

 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HER AGAIN

WHEN THE TIME OF HER LABOR CAME THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB

AND WHEN SHE WAS IN LABOR ONE PUT OUT A HAND AND THE MIDWIFE TOOK AND TIED A SCARLET THREAD ON HIS HAND SAYING THIS ONE CAME OUT FIRST

 BUT AS HE DREW BACK HIS HAND BEHOLD HIS BROTHER CAME OUT

AND SHE SAID WHAT A BREACH YOU HAVE MADE FOR YOURSELF

 THEREFORE HIS NAME WAS CALLED PEREZ

AFTERWARD HIS BROTHER CAME OUT WITH THE SCARLET THREAD ON HIS HAND AND HIS NAME WAS CALLED ZERAH

NOW JOSEPH HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO EGYPT AND POTIPHAR AN OFFICER OF PHARAOH THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD AN EGYPTIAN HAD BOUGHT HIM FROM THE ISHMAELITES WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM DOWN THERE

THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH AND HE BECAME A SUCCESSFUL MAN AND HE WAS IN THE HOUSE OF HIS EGYPTIAN MASTER

HIS MASTER SAW THAT THE LORD WAS WITH HIM AND THAT THE LORD CAUSED ALL THAT HE DID TO SUCCEED IN HIS HANDS

SO JOSEPH FOUND FAVOR IN HIS SIGHT AND ATTENDED HIM AND HE MADE HIM OVERSEER OF HIS HOUSE AND PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF ALL THAT HE HAD

FROM THE TIME THAT HE MADE HIM OVERSEER IN HIS HOUSE AND OVER ALL THAT HE HAD THE LORD BLESSED THE EGYPTIAN'S HOUSE FOR JOSEPH'S SAKE; THE BLESSING OF THE LORD WAS ON ALL THAT HE HAD IN HOUSE AND FIELD

SO HE LEFT ALL THAT HE HAD IN JOSEPH'S CHARGE AND BECAUSE OF HIM HE HAD NO CONCERN ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE FOOD HE ATE

NOW JOSEPH WAS HANDSOME IN FORM AND APPEARANCE

AND AFTER A TIME HIS MASTER'S WIFE CAST HER EYES ON JOSEPH AND SAID LIE WITH ME

 BUT HE REFUSED AND SAID TO HIS MASTER'S WIFE BEHOLD BECAUSE OF ME MY MASTER HAS NO CONCERN ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE AND HE HAS PUT EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS IN MY CHARGE

HE IS NOT GREATER IN THIS HOUSE THAN I AM NOR HAS HE KEPT BACK ANYTHING FROM ME EXCEPT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS WIFE

HOW THEN CAN I DO THIS GREAT WICKEDNESS AND SIN AGAINST GOD

 AND AS SHE SPOKE TO JOSEPH DAY AFTER DAY HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER TO LIE BESIDE HER OR TO BE WITH HER

BUT ONE DAY WHEN HE WENT INTO THE HOUSE TO DO HIS WORK AND NONE OF THE MEN OF THE HOUSE WAS THERE IN THE HOUSE SHE CAUGHT HIM BY HIS GARMENT SAYING LIE WITH ME

 BUT HE LEFT HIS GARMENT IN HER HAND AND FLED AND GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE

AND AS SOON AS SHE SAW THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS GARMENT IN HER HAND AND HAD FLED OUT OF THE HOUSE SHE CALLED TO THE MEN OF HER HOUSEHOLD AND SAID TO THEM SEE HE HAS BROUGHT AMONG US A HEBREW TO LAUGH AT US

HE CAME IN TO ME TO LIE WITH ME AND I CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE

AND AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I LIFTED UP MY VOICE AND CRIED OUT HE LEFT HIS GARMENT BESIDE ME AND FLED AND GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE

 THEN SHE LAID UP HIS GARMENT BY HER UNTIL HIS MASTER CAME HOME AND SHE TOLD HIM THE SAME STORY SAYING THE HEBREW SERVANT WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT AMONG US CAME IN TO ME TO LAUGH AT ME

BUT AS SOON AS I LIFTED UP MY VOICE AND CRIED HE LEFT HIS GARMENT BESIDE ME AND FLED OUT OF THE HOUSE

 AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HEARD THE WORDS THAT HIS WIFE SPOKE TO HIM THIS IS THE WAY YOUR SERVANT TREATED ME HIS ANGER WAS KINDLED

AND JOSEPH'S MASTER TOOK HIM AND PUT HIM INTO THE PRISON THE PLACE WHERE THE KING'S PRISONERS WERE CONFINED AND HE WAS THERE IN PRISON

BUT THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH AND SHOWED HIM STEADFAST LOVE AND GAVE HIM FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON

AND THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON PUT JOSEPH IN CHARGE OF ALL THE PRISONERS WHO WERE IN THE PRISON

WHATEVER WAS DONE THERE HE WAS THE ONE WHO DID IT

THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS IN JOSEPH'S CHARGE BECAUSE THE LORD WAS WITH HIM

AND WHATEVER HE DID THE LORD MADE IT SUCCEED

SOME TIME AFTER THIS THE CUPBEARER OF THE KING OF EGYPT AND HIS BAKER COMMITTED AN OFFENSE AGAINST THEIR LORD THE KING OF EGYPT

AND PHARAOH WAS ANGRY WITH HIS TWO OFFICERS THE CHIEF CUPBEARER AND THE CHIEF BAKER AND HE PUT THEM IN CUSTODY IN THE HOUSE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD IN THE PRISON WHERE JOSEPH WAS CONFINED

THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD APPOINTED JOSEPH TO BE WITH THEM AND HE ATTENDED THEM

THEY CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME IN CUSTODY

AND ONE NIGHT THEY BOTH DREAMEDTHE CUPBEARER AND THE BAKER OF THE KING OF EGYPT WHO WERE CONFINED IN THE PRISONEACH HIS OWN DREAM AND EACH DREAM WITH ITS OWN INTERPRETATION

WHEN JOSEPH CAME TO THEM IN THE MORNING HE SAW THAT THEY WERE TROUBLED

SO HE ASKED PHARAOH'S OFFICERS WHO WERE WITH HIM IN CUSTODY IN HIS MASTER'S HOUSE WHY ARE YOUR FACES DOWNCAST TODAY

 THEY SAID TO HIM WE HAVE HAD DREAMS AND THERE IS NO ONE TO INTERPRET THEM

 AND JOSEPH SAID TO THEM DO NOT INTERPRETATIONS BELONG TO GOD

PLEASE TELL THEM TO ME

 SO THE CHIEF CUPBEARER TOLD HIS DREAM TO JOSEPH AND SAID TO HIM IN MY DREAM THERE WAS A VINE BEFORE ME AND ON THE VINE THERE WERE THREE BRANCHES

AS SOON AS IT BUDDED ITS BLOSSOMS SHOT FORTH AND THE CLUSTERS RIPENED INTO GRAPES

PHARAOH'S CUP WAS IN MY HAND AND I TOOK THE GRAPES AND PRESSED THEM INTO PHARAOH'S CUP AND PLACED THE CUP IN PHARAOH'S HAND

 THEN JOSEPH SAID TO HIM THIS IS ITS INTERPRETATION THE THREE BRANCHES ARE THREE DAYS

IN THREE DAYS PHARAOH WILL LIFT UP YOUR HEAD AND RESTORE YOU TO YOUR OFFICE AND YOU SHALL PLACE PHARAOH'S CUP IN HIS HAND AS FORMERLY WHEN YOU WERE HIS CUPBEARER

ONLY REMEMBER ME WHEN IT IS WELL WITH YOU AND PLEASE DO ME THE KINDNESS TO MENTION ME TO PHARAOH AND SO GET ME OUT OF THIS HOUSE

FOR I WAS INDEED STOLEN OUT OF THE LAND OF THE HEBREWS AND HERE ALSO I HAVE DONE NOTHING THAT THEY SHOULD PUT ME INTO THE PIT

 WHEN THE CHIEF BAKER SAW THAT THE INTERPRETATION WAS FAVORABLE HE SAID TO JOSEPH I ALSO HAD A DREAM THERE WERE THREE CAKE BASKETS ON MY HEAD AND IN THE UPPERMOST BASKET THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF BAKED FOOD FOR PHARAOH BUT THE BIRDS WERE EATING IT OUT OF THE BASKET ON MY HEAD

 AND JOSEPH ANSWERED AND SAID THIS IS ITS INTERPRETATION THE THREE BASKETS ARE THREE DAYS

IN THREE DAYS PHARAOH WILL LIFT UP YOUR HEADFROM YOU

AND HANG YOU ON A TREE

AND THE BIRDS WILL EAT THE FLESH FROM YOU

 ON THE THIRD DAY WHICH WAS PHARAOH'S BIRTHDAY HE MADE A FEAST FOR ALL HIS SERVANTS AND LIFTED UP THE HEAD OF THE CHIEF CUPBEARER AND THE HEAD OF THE CHIEF BAKER AMONG HIS SERVANTS

HE RESTORED THE CHIEF CUPBEARER TO HIS POSITION AND HE PLACED THE CUP IN PHARAOH'S HAND

BUT HE HANGED THE CHIEF BAKER AS JOSEPH HAD INTERPRETED TO THEM

YET THE CHIEF CUPBEARER DID NOT REMEMBER JOSEPH BUT FORGOT HIM

AFTER TWO WHOLE YEARS PHARAOH DREAMED THAT HE WAS STANDING BY THE NILE AND BEHOLD THERE CAME UP OUT OF THE NILE SEVEN COWS ATTRACTIVE AND PLUMP AND THEY FED IN THE REED GRASS

AND BEHOLD SEVEN OTHER COWS UGLY AND THIN CAME UP OUT OF THE NILE AFTER THEM AND STOOD BY THE OTHER COWS ON THE BANK OF THE NILE

AND THE UGLY THIN COWS ATE UP THE SEVEN ATTRACTIVE PLUMP COWS

AND PHARAOH AWOKE

AND HE FELL ASLEEP AND DREAMED A SECOND TIME

AND BEHOLD SEVEN EARS OF GRAIN PLUMP AND GOOD WERE GROWING ON ONE STALK

AND BEHOLD AFTER THEM SPROUTED SEVEN EARS THIN AND BLIGHTED BY THE EAST WIND

AND THE THIN EARS SWALLOWED UP THE SEVEN PLUMP FULL EARS

AND PHARAOH AWOKE AND BEHOLD IT WAS A DREAM

SO IN THE MORNING HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED AND HE SENT AND CALLED FOR ALL THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT AND ALL ITS WISE MEN

PHARAOH TOLD THEM HIS DREAMS BUT THERE WAS NONE WHO COULD INTERPRET THEM TO PHARAOH

THEN THE CHIEF CUPBEARER SAID TO PHARAOH I REMEMBER MY OFFENSES TODAY

WHEN PHARAOH WAS ANGRY WITH HIS SERVANTS AND PUT ME AND THE CHIEF BAKER IN CUSTODY IN THE HOUSE OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD WE DREAMED ON THE SAME NIGHT HE AND I EACH HAVING A DREAM WITH ITS OWN INTERPRETATION

A YOUNG HEBREW WAS THERE WITH US A SERVANT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

WHEN WE TOLD HIM HE INTERPRETED OUR DREAMS TO US GIVING AN INTERPRETATION TO EACH MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DREAM

AND AS HE INTERPRETED TO US SO IT CAME ABOUT

I WAS RESTORED TO MY OFFICE AND THE BAKER WAS HANGED

 THEN PHARAOH SENT AND CALLED JOSEPH AND THEY QUICKLY BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE PIT

AND WHEN HE HAD SHAVED HIMSELF AND CHANGED HIS CLOTHES HE CAME IN BEFORE PHARAOH

AND PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH I HAVE HAD A DREAM AND THERE IS NO ONE WHO CAN INTERPRET IT

I HAVE HEARD IT SAID OF YOU THAT WHEN YOU HEAR A DREAM YOU CAN INTERPRET IT

 JOSEPH ANSWERED PHARAOH IT IS NOT IN ME; GOD WILL GIVE PHARAOH A FAVORABLE ANSWER

 THEN PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH BEHOLD IN MY DREAM I WAS STANDING ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE

SEVEN COWS PLUMP AND ATTRACTIVE CAME UP OUT OF THE NILE AND FED IN THE REED GRASS

SEVEN OTHER COWS CAME UP AFTER THEM POOR AND VERY UGLY AND THIN SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND THE THIN UGLY COWS ATE UP THE FIRST SEVEN PLUMP COWS BUT WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEM NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY HAD EATEN THEM FOR THEY WERE STILL AS UGLY AS AT THE BEGINNING

THEN I AWOKE

I ALSO SAW IN MY DREAM SEVEN EARS GROWING ON ONE STALK FULL AND GOOD

SEVEN EARS WITHERED THIN AND BLIGHTED BY THE EAST WIND SPROUTED AFTER THEM AND THE THIN EARS SWALLOWED UP THE SEVEN GOOD EARS

AND I TOLD IT TO THE MAGICIANS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD EXPLAIN IT TO ME

 THEN JOSEPH SAID TO PHARAOH THE DREAMS OF PHARAOH ARE ONE; GOD HAS REVEALED TO PHARAOH WHAT HE IS ABOUT TO DO

THE SEVEN GOOD COWS ARE SEVEN YEARS AND THE SEVEN GOOD EARS ARE SEVEN YEARS; THE DREAMS ARE ONE

THE SEVEN LEAN AND UGLY COWS THAT CAME UP AFTER THEM ARE SEVEN YEARS AND THE SEVEN EMPTY EARS BLIGHTED BY THE EAST WIND ARE ALSO SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE

IT IS AS I TOLD PHARAOH; GOD HAS SHOWN TO PHARAOH WHAT HE IS ABOUT TO DO

THERE WILL COME SEVEN YEARS OF GREAT PLENTY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT BUT AFTER THEM THERE WILL ARISE SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE AND ALL THE PLENTY WILL BE FORGOTTEN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

THE FAMINE WILL CONSUME THE LAND AND THE PLENTY WILL BE UNKNOWN IN THE LAND BY REASON OF THE FAMINE THAT WILL FOLLOW FOR IT WILL BE VERY SEVERE

AND THE DOUBLING OF PHARAOH'S DREAM MEANS THAT THE THING IS FIXED BY GOD AND GOD WILL SHORTLY BRING IT ABOUT

NOW THEREFORE LET PHARAOH SELECT A DISCERNING AND WISE MAN AND SET HIM OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT

LET PHARAOH PROCEED TO APPOINT OVERSEERS OVER THE LAND AND TAKE ONEFIFTH OF THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND OF EGYPT DURING THE SEVEN PLENTIFUL YEARS

AND LET THEM GATHER ALL THE FOOD OF THESE GOOD YEARS THAT ARE COMING AND STORE UP GRAIN UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF PHARAOH FOR FOOD IN THE CITIES AND LET THEM KEEP IT

THAT FOOD SHALL BE A RESERVE FOR THE LAND AGAINST THE SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE THAT ARE TO OCCUR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SO THAT THE LAND MAY NOT PERISH THROUGH THE FAMINE

 THIS PROPOSAL PLEASED PHARAOH AND ALL HIS SERVANTS

AND PHARAOH SAID TO HIS SERVANTS CAN WE FIND A MAN LIKE THIS IN WHOM IS THE SPIRIT OF GOD

 THEN PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH SINCE GOD HAS SHOWN YOU ALL THIS THERE IS NONE SO DISCERNING AND WISE AS YOU ARE

YOU SHALL BE OVER MY HOUSE AND ALL MY PEOPLE SHALL ORDER THEMSELVES AS YOU COMMAND

ONLY AS REGARDS THE THRONE WILL I BE GREATER THAN YOU

 AND PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH SEE I HAVE SET YOU OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

 THEN PHARAOH TOOK HIS SIGNET RING FROM HIS HAND AND PUT IT ON JOSEPH'S HAND AND CLOTHED HIM IN GARMENTS OF FINE LINEN AND PUT A GOLD CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK

AND HE MADE HIM RIDE IN HIS SECOND CHARIOT

AND THEY CALLED OUT BEFORE HIM BOW THE KNEE

 THUS HE SET HIM OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

MOREOVER PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH I AM PHARAOH AND WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT NO ONE SHALL LIFT UP HAND OR FOOT IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

 AND PHARAOH CALLED JOSEPH'S NAME ZAPHENATHPANEAH

AND HE GAVE HIM IN MARRIAGE ASENATH THE DAUGHTER OF POTIPHERA PRIEST OF ON

SO JOSEPH WENT OUT OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT

JOSEPH WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT

AND JOSEPH WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF PHARAOH AND WENT THROUGH ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

DURING THE SEVEN PLENTIFUL YEARS THE EARTH PRODUCED ABUNDANTLY AND HE GATHERED UP ALL THE FOOD OF THESE SEVEN YEARS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND PUT THE FOOD IN THE CITIES

HE PUT IN EVERY CITY THE FOOD FROM THE FIELDS AROUND IT

AND JOSEPH STORED UP GRAIN IN GREAT ABUNDANCE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA UNTIL HE CEASED TO MEASURE IT FOR IT COULD NOT BE MEASURED

BEFORE THE YEAR OF FAMINE CAME TWO SONS WERE BORN TO JOSEPH

ASENATH THE DAUGHTER OF POTIPHERA PRIEST OF ON BORE THEM TO HIM

JOSEPH CALLED THE NAME OF THE FIRSTBORN MANASSEH

FOR HE SAID GOD HAS MADE ME FORGET ALL MY HARDSHIP AND ALL MY FATHER'S HOUSE

 THE NAME OF THE SECOND HE CALLED EPHRAIM FOR GOD HAS MADE ME FRUITFUL IN THE LAND OF MY AFFLICTION

 THE SEVEN YEARS OF PLENTY THAT OCCURRED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT CAME TO AN END AND THE SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE BEGAN TO COME AS JOSEPH HAD SAID

THERE WAS FAMINE IN ALL LANDS BUT IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT THERE WAS BREAD

WHEN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT WAS FAMISHED THE PEOPLE CRIED TO PHARAOH FOR BREAD

PHARAOH SAID TO ALL THE EGYPTIANS GO TO JOSEPH

WHAT HE SAYS TO YOU DO

 SO WHEN THE FAMINE HAD SPREAD OVER ALL THE LAND JOSEPH OPENED ALL THE STOREHOUSES AND SOLD TO THE EGYPTIANS FOR THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

MOREOVER ALL THE EARTH CAME TO EGYPT TO JOSEPH TO BUY GRAIN BECAUSE THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE OVER ALL THE EARTH

WHEN JACOB LEARNED THAT THERE WAS GRAIN FOR SALE IN EGYPT HE SAID TO HIS SONS WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

 AND HE SAID BEHOLD I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS GRAIN FOR SALE IN EGYPT

GO DOWN AND BUY GRAIN FOR US THERE THAT WE MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE

 SO TEN OF JOSEPH'S BROTHERS WENT DOWN TO BUY GRAIN IN EGYPT

BUT JACOB DID NOT SEND BENJAMIN JOSEPH'S BROTHER WITH HIS BROTHERS FOR HE FEARED THAT HARM MIGHT HAPPEN TO HIM

THUS THE SONS OF ISRAEL CAME TO BUY AMONG THE OTHERS WHO CAME FOR THE FAMINE WAS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

NOW JOSEPH WAS GOVERNOR OVER THE LAND

HE WAS THE ONE WHO SOLD TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

AND JOSEPH'S BROTHERS CAME AND BOWED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM WITH THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND

JOSEPH SAW HIS BROTHERS AND RECOGNIZED THEM BUT HE TREATED THEM LIKE STRANGERS AND SPOKE ROUGHLY TO THEM

WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 HE SAID

THEY SAID FROM THE LAND OF CANAAN TO BUY FOOD

 AND JOSEPH RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHERS BUT THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM

AND JOSEPH REMEMBERED THE DREAMS THAT HE HAD DREAMED OF THEM

AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU ARE SPIES; YOU HAVE COME TO SEE THE NAKEDNESS OF THE LAND

 THEY SAID TO HIM NO MY LORD YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME TO BUY FOOD

WE ARE ALL SONS OF ONE MAN

WE ARE HONEST MEN

YOUR SERVANTS HAVE NEVER BEEN SPIES

 HE SAID TO THEM NO IT IS THE NAKEDNESS OF THE LAND THAT YOU HAVE COME TO SEE

 AND THEY SAID WE YOUR SERVANTS ARE TWELVE BROTHERS THE SONS OF ONE MAN IN THE LAND OF CANAAN AND BEHOLD THE YOUNGEST IS THIS DAY WITH OUR FATHER AND ONE IS NO MORE

 BUT JOSEPH SAID TO THEM IT IS AS I SAID TO YOU

YOU ARE SPIES

BY THIS YOU SHALL BE TESTED BY THE LIFE OF PHARAOH YOU SHALL NOT GO FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES HERE

SEND ONE OF YOU AND LET HIM BRING YOUR BROTHER WHILE YOU REMAIN CONFINED THAT YOUR WORDS MAY BE TESTED WHETHER THERE IS TRUTH IN YOU

OR ELSE BY THE LIFE OF PHARAOH SURELY YOU ARE SPIES

 AND HE PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER IN CUSTODY FOR THREE DAYS

ON THE THIRD DAY JOSEPH SAID TO THEM DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE FOR I FEAR GOD IF YOU ARE HONEST MEN LET ONE OF YOUR BROTHERS REMAIN CONFINED WHERE YOU ARE IN CUSTODY AND LET THE REST GO AND CARRY GRAIN FOR THE FAMINE OF YOUR HOUSEHOLDS AND BRING YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER TO ME

SO YOUR WORDS WILL BE VERIFIED AND YOU SHALL NOT DIE

 AND THEY DID SO

THEN THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER IN TRUTH WE ARE GUILTY CONCERNING OUR BROTHER IN THAT WE SAW THE DISTRESS OF HIS SOUL WHEN HE BEGGED US AND WE DID NOT LISTEN

THAT IS WHY THIS DISTRESS HAS COME UPON US

 AND REUBEN ANSWERED THEM DID I NOT TELL YOU NOT TO SIN AGAINST THE BOY

BUT YOU DID NOT LISTEN

SO NOW THERE COMES A RECKONING FOR HIS BLOOD

 THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD THEM FOR THERE WAS AN INTERPRETER BETWEEN THEM

THEN HE TURNED AWAY FROM THEM AND WEPT

AND HE RETURNED TO THEM AND SPOKE TO THEM

AND HE TOOK SIMEON FROM THEM AND BOUND HIM BEFORE THEIR EYES

AND JOSEPH GAVE ORDERS TO FILL THEIR BAGS WITH GRAIN AND TO REPLACE EVERY MAN'S MONEY IN HIS SACK AND TO GIVE THEM PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY

THIS WAS DONE FOR THEM

THEN THEY LOADED THEIR DONKEYS WITH THEIR GRAIN AND DEPARTED

AND AS ONE OF THEM OPENED HIS SACK TO GIVE HIS DONKEY FODDER AT THE LODGING PLACE HE SAW HIS MONEY IN THE MOUTH OF HIS SACK

HE SAID TO HIS BROTHERS MY MONEY HAS BEEN PUT BACK; HERE IT IS IN THE MOUTH OF MY SACK

 AT THIS THEIR HEARTS FAILED THEM AND THEY TURNED TREMBLING TO ONE ANOTHER SAYING WHAT IS THIS THAT GOD HAS DONE TO US

 WHEN THEY CAME TO JACOB THEIR FATHER IN THE LAND OF CANAAN THEY TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM SAYING THE MAN THE LORD OF THE LAND SPOKE ROUGHLY TO US AND TOOK US TO BE SPIES OF THE LAND

BUT WE SAID TO HIM 'WE ARE HONEST MEN; WE HAVE NEVER BEEN SPIES

WE ARE TWELVE BROTHERS SONS OF OUR FATHER

ONE IS NO MORE AND THE YOUNGEST IS THIS DAY WITH OUR FATHER IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

' THEN THE MAN THE LORD OF THE LAND SAID TO US 'BY THIS I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU ARE HONEST MEN LEAVE ONE OF YOUR BROTHERS WITH ME AND TAKE GRAIN FOR THE FAMINE OF YOUR HOUSEHOLDS AND GO YOUR WAY

BRING YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER TO ME

THEN I SHALL KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT SPIES BUT HONEST MEN AND I WILL DELIVER YOUR BROTHER TO YOU AND YOU SHALL TRADE IN THE LAND

' AS THEY EMPTIED THEIR SACKS BEHOLD EVERY MAN'S BUNDLE OF MONEY WAS IN HIS SACK

AND WHEN THEY AND THEIR FATHER SAW THEIR BUNDLES OF MONEY THEY WERE AFRAID

AND JACOB THEIR FATHER SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE BEREAVED ME OF MY CHILDREN JOSEPH IS NO MORE AND SIMEON IS NO MORE AND NOW YOU WOULD TAKE BENJAMIN

ALL THIS HAS COME AGAINST ME

 THEN REUBEN SAID TO HIS FATHER KILL MY TWO SONS IF I DO NOT BRING HIM BACK TO YOU

PUT HIM IN MY HANDS AND I WILL BRING HIM BACK TO YOU

 BUT HE SAID MY SON SHALL NOT GO DOWN WITH YOU FOR HIS BROTHER IS DEAD AND HE IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT

IF HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM ON THE JOURNEY THAT YOU ARE TO MAKE YOU WOULD BRING DOWN MY GRAY HAIRS WITH SORROW TO SHEOL

NOW THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN THE LAND

AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THE GRAIN THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT FROM EGYPT THEIR FATHER SAID TO THEM GO AGAIN BUY US A LITTLE FOOD

 BUT JUDAH SAID TO HIM THE MAN SOLEMNLY WARNED US SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE UNLESS YOUR BROTHER IS WITH YOU

' IF YOU WILL SEND OUR BROTHER WITH US WE WILL GO DOWN AND BUY YOU FOOD

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT SEND HIM WE WILL NOT GO DOWN FOR THE MAN SAID TO US 'YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE UNLESS YOUR BROTHER IS WITH YOU

' ISRAEL SAID WHY DID YOU TREAT ME SO BADLY AS TO TELL THE MAN THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER BROTHER

 THEY REPLIED THE MAN QUESTIONED US CAREFULLY ABOUT OURSELVES AND OUR KINDRED SAYING 'IS YOUR FATHER STILL ALIVE

DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER BROTHER

' WHAT WE TOLD HIM WAS IN ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS

COULD WE IN ANY WAY KNOW THAT HE WOULD SAY 'BRING YOUR BROTHER DOWN'

 AND JUDAH SAID TO ISRAEL HIS FATHER SEND THE BOY WITH ME AND WE WILL ARISE AND GO THAT WE MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE BOTH WE AND YOU AND ALSO OUR LITTLE ONES

I WILL BE A PLEDGE OF HIS SAFETY

FROM MY HAND YOU SHALL REQUIRE HIM

IF I DO NOT BRING HIM BACK TO YOU AND SET HIM BEFORE YOU THEN LET ME BEAR THE BLAME FOREVER

IF WE HAD NOT DELAYED WE WOULD NOW HAVE RETURNED TWICE

 THEN THEIR FATHER ISRAEL SAID TO THEM IF IT MUST BE SO THEN DO THIS TAKE SOME OF THE CHOICE FRUITS OF THE LAND IN YOUR BAGS AND CARRY A PRESENT DOWN TO THE MAN A LITTLE BALM AND A LITTLE HONEY GUM MYRRH PISTACHIO NUTS AND ALMONDS

TAKE DOUBLE THE MONEY WITH YOU

CARRY BACK WITH YOU THE MONEY THAT WAS RETURNED IN THE MOUTH OF YOUR SACKS

PERHAPS IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT

TAKE ALSO YOUR BROTHER AND ARISE GO AGAIN TO THE MAN

MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN AND MAY HE SEND BACK YOUR OTHER BROTHER AND BENJAMIN

AND AS FOR ME IF I AM BEREAVED OF MY CHILDREN I AM BEREAVED

 SO THE MEN TOOK THIS PRESENT AND THEY TOOK DOUBLE THE MONEY WITH THEM AND BENJAMIN

THEY AROSE AND WENT DOWN TO EGYPT AND STOOD BEFORE JOSEPH

WHEN JOSEPH SAW BENJAMIN WITH THEM HE SAID TO THE STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE BRING THE MEN INTO THE HOUSE AND SLAUGHTER AN ANIMAL AND MAKE READY FOR THE MEN ARE TO DINE WITH ME AT NOON

 THE MAN DID AS JOSEPH TOLD HIM AND BROUGHT THE MEN TO JOSEPH'S HOUSE

AND THE MEN WERE AFRAID BECAUSE THEY WERE BROUGHT TO JOSEPH'S HOUSE AND THEY SAID IT IS BECAUSE OF THE MONEY WHICH WAS REPLACED IN OUR SACKS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE ARE BROUGHT IN SO THAT HE MAY ASSAULT US AND FALL UPON US TO MAKE US SERVANTS AND SEIZE OUR DONKEYS

 SO THEY WENT UP TO THE STEWARD OF JOSEPH'S HOUSE AND SPOKE WITH HIM AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND SAID OH MY LORD WE CAME DOWN THE FIRST TIME TO BUY FOOD

AND WHEN WE CAME TO THE LODGING PLACE WE OPENED OUR SACKS AND THERE WAS EACH MAN'S MONEY IN THE MOUTH OF HIS SACK OUR MONEY IN FULL WEIGHT

SO WE HAVE BROUGHT IT AGAIN WITH US AND WE HAVE BROUGHT OTHER MONEY DOWN WITH US TO BUY FOOD

WE DO NOT KNOW WHO PUT OUR MONEY IN OUR SACKS

 HE REPLIED PEACE TO YOU DO NOT BE AFRAID

YOUR GOD AND THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER HAS PUT TREASURE IN YOUR SACKS FOR YOU

I RECEIVED YOUR MONEY

 THEN HE BROUGHT SIMEON OUT TO THEM

AND WHEN THE MAN HAD BROUGHT THE MEN INTO JOSEPH'S HOUSE AND GIVEN THEM WATER AND THEY HAD WASHED THEIR FEET AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THEIR DONKEYS FODDER THEY PREPARED THE PRESENT FOR JOSEPH'S COMING AT NOON FOR THEY HEARD THAT THEY SHOULD EAT BREAD THERE

WHEN JOSEPH CAME HOME THEY BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE TO HIM THE PRESENT THAT THEY HAD WITH THEM AND BOWED DOWN TO HIM TO THE GROUND

AND HE INQUIRED ABOUT THEIR WELFARE AND SAID IS YOUR FATHER WELL THE OLD MAN OF WHOM YOU SPOKE

IS HE STILL ALIVE

 THEY SAID YOUR SERVANT OUR FATHER IS WELL; HE IS STILL ALIVE

 AND THEY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND PROSTRATED THEMSELVES

AND HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN HIS MOTHER'S SON AND SAID IS THIS YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER OF WHOM YOU SPOKE TO ME

GOD BE GRACIOUS TO YOU MY SON

 THEN JOSEPH HURRIED OUT FOR HIS COMPASSION GREW WARM FOR HIS BROTHER AND HE SOUGHT A PLACE TO WEEP

AND HE ENTERED HIS CHAMBER AND WEPT THERE

THEN HE WASHED HIS FACE AND CAME OUT

AND CONTROLLING HIMSELF HE SAID SERVE THE FOOD

 THEY SERVED HIM BY HIMSELF AND THEM BY THEMSELVES AND THE EGYPTIANS WHO ATE WITH HIM BY THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE EGYPTIANS COULD NOT EAT WITH THE HEBREWS FOR THAT IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE EGYPTIANS

AND THEY SAT BEFORE HIM THE FIRSTBORN ACCORDING TO HIS BIRTHRIGHT AND THE YOUNGEST ACCORDING TO HIS YOUTH

AND THE MEN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN AMAZEMENT

PORTIONS WERE TAKEN TO THEM FROM JOSEPH'S TABLE BUT BENJAMIN'S PORTION WAS FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS ANY OF THEIRS

AND THEY DRANK AND WERE MERRY WITH HIM

THEN HE COMMANDED THE STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE FILL THE MEN'S SACKS WITH FOOD AS MUCH AS THEY CAN CARRY AND PUT EACH MAN'S MONEY IN THE MOUTH OF HIS SACK AND PUT MY CUP THE SILVER CUP IN THE MOUTH OF THE SACK OF THE YOUNGEST WITH HIS MONEY FOR THE GRAIN

 AND HE DID AS JOSEPH TOLD HIM

AS SOON AS THE MORNING WAS LIGHT THE MEN WERE SENT AWAY WITH THEIR DONKEYS

THEY HAD GONE ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY

NOW JOSEPH SAID TO HIS STEWARD UP FOLLOW AFTER THE MEN AND WHEN YOU OVERTAKE THEM SAY TO THEM 'WHY HAVE YOU REPAID EVIL FOR GOOD

IS IT NOT FROM THIS THAT MY LORD DRINKS AND BY THIS THAT HE PRACTICES DIVINATION

YOU HAVE DONE EVIL IN DOING THIS

' WHEN HE OVERTOOK THEM HE SPOKE TO THEM THESE WORDS

THEY SAID TO HIM WHY DOES MY LORD SPEAK SUCH WORDS AS THESE

FAR BE IT FROM YOUR SERVANTS TO DO SUCH A THING

BEHOLD THE MONEY THAT WE FOUND IN THE MOUTHS OF OUR SACKS WE BROUGHT BACK TO YOU FROM THE LAND OF CANAAN

HOW THEN COULD WE STEAL SILVER OR GOLD FROM YOUR LORD'S HOUSE

WHICHEVER OF YOUR SERVANTS IS FOUND WITH IT SHALL DIE AND WE ALSO WILL BE MY LORD'S SERVANTS

 HE SAID LET IT BE AS YOU SAY HE WHO IS FOUND WITH IT SHALL BE MY SERVANT AND THE REST OF YOU SHALL BE INNOCENT

 THEN EACH MAN QUICKLY LOWERED HIS SACK TO THE GROUND AND EACH MAN OPENED HIS SACK

AND HE SEARCHED BEGINNING WITH THE ELDEST AND ENDING WITH THE YOUNGEST

AND THE CUP WAS FOUND IN BENJAMIN'S SACK

THEN THEY TORE THEIR CLOTHES AND EVERY MAN LOADED HIS DONKEY AND THEY RETURNED TO THE CITY

WHEN JUDAH AND HIS BROTHERS CAME TO JOSEPH'S HOUSE HE WAS STILL THERE

THEY FELL BEFORE HIM TO THE GROUND

JOSEPH SAID TO THEM WHAT DEED IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT A MAN LIKE ME CAN INDEED PRACTICE DIVINATION

 AND JUDAH SAID WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO MY LORD

WHAT SHALL WE SPEAK

OR HOW CAN WE CLEAR OURSELVES

GOD HAS FOUND OUT THE GUILT OF YOUR SERVANTS; BEHOLD WE ARE MY LORD'S SERVANTS BOTH WE AND HE ALSO IN WHOSE HAND THE CUP HAS BEEN FOUND

 BUT HE SAID FAR BE IT FROM ME THAT I SHOULD DO SO

ONLY THE MAN IN WHOSE HAND THE CUP WAS FOUND SHALL BE MY SERVANT

BUT AS FOR YOU GO UP IN PEACE TO YOUR FATHER

 THEN JUDAH WENT UP TO HIM AND SAID O MY LORD PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK A WORD IN MY LORD'S EARS AND LET NOT YOUR ANGER BURN AGAINST YOUR SERVANT FOR YOU ARE LIKE PHARAOH HIMSELF

MY LORD ASKED HIS SERVANTS SAYING 'HAVE YOU A FATHER OR A BROTHER

' AND WE SAID TO MY LORD 'WE HAVE A FATHER AN OLD MAN AND A YOUNG BROTHER THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE

HIS BROTHER IS DEAD AND HE ALONE IS LEFT OF HIS MOTHER'S CHILDREN AND HIS FATHER LOVES HIM

' THEN YOU SAID TO YOUR SERVANTS 'BRING HIM DOWN TO ME THAT I MAY SET MY EYES ON HIM

' WE SAID TO MY LORD 'THE BOY CANNOT LEAVE HIS FATHER FOR IF HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS FATHER HIS FATHER WOULD DIE

' THEN YOU SAID TO YOUR SERVANTS 'UNLESS YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH YOU YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE AGAIN

' WHEN WE WENT BACK TO YOUR SERVANT MY FATHER WE TOLD HIM THE WORDS OF MY LORD

AND WHEN OUR FATHER SAID 'GO AGAIN BUY US A LITTLE FOOD' WE SAID 'WE CANNOT GO DOWN

IF OUR YOUNGEST BROTHER GOES WITH US THEN WE WILL GO DOWN

FOR WE CANNOT SEE THE MAN'S FACE UNLESS OUR YOUNGEST BROTHER IS WITH US

' THEN YOUR SERVANT MY FATHER SAID TO US 'YOU KNOW THAT MY WIFE BORE ME TWO SONS

ONE LEFT ME AND I SAID SURELY HE HAS BEEN TORN TO PIECES AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE

IF YOU TAKE THIS ONE ALSO FROM ME AND HARM HAPPENS TO HIM YOU WILL BRING DOWN MY GRAY HAIRS IN EVIL TO SHEOL

' NOW THEREFORE AS SOON AS I COME TO YOUR SERVANT MY FATHER AND THE BOY IS NOT WITH US THEN AS HIS LIFE IS BOUND UP IN THE BOY'S LIFE AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT THE BOY IS NOT WITH US HE WILL DIE AND YOUR SERVANTS WILL BRING DOWN THE GRAY HAIRS OF YOUR SERVANT OUR FATHER WITH SORROW TO SHEOL

FOR YOUR SERVANT BECAME A PLEDGE OF SAFETY FOR THE BOY TO MY FATHER SAYING 'IF I DO NOT BRING HIM BACK TO YOU THEN I SHALL BEAR THE BLAME BEFORE MY FATHER ALL MY LIFE

' NOW THEREFORE PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN INSTEAD OF THE BOY AS A SERVANT TO MY LORD AND LET THE BOY GO BACK WITH HIS BROTHERS

FOR HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY FATHER IF THE BOY IS NOT WITH ME

I FEAR TO SEE THE EVIL THAT WOULD FIND MY FATHER

THEN JOSEPH COULD NOT CONTROL HIMSELF BEFORE ALL THOSE WHO STOOD BY HIM

HE CRIED MAKE EVERYONE GO OUT FROM ME

 SO NO ONE STAYED WITH HIM WHEN JOSEPH MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS BROTHERS

AND HE WEPT ALOUD SO THAT THE EGYPTIANS HEARD IT AND THE HOUSEHOLD OF PHARAOH HEARD IT

AND JOSEPH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS I AM JOSEPH

IS MY FATHER STILL ALIVE

 BUT HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM FOR THEY WERE DISMAYED AT HIS PRESENCE

SO JOSEPH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS COME NEAR TO ME PLEASE

 AND THEY CAME NEAR

AND HE SAID I AM YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH WHOM YOU SOLD INTO EGYPT

AND NOW DO NOT BE DISTRESSED OR ANGRY WITH YOURSELVES BECAUSE YOU SOLD ME HERE FOR GOD SENT ME BEFORE YOU TO PRESERVE LIFE

FOR THE FAMINE HAS BEEN IN THE LAND THESE TWO YEARS AND THERE ARE YET FIVE YEARS IN WHICH THERE WILL BE NEITHER PLOWING NOR HARVEST

AND GOD SENT ME BEFORE YOU TO PRESERVE FOR YOU A REMNANT ON EARTH AND TO KEEP ALIVE FOR YOU MANY SURVIVORS

SO IT WAS NOT YOU WHO SENT ME HERE BUT GOD

HE HAS MADE ME A FATHER TO PHARAOH AND LORD OF ALL HIS HOUSE AND RULER OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

HURRY AND GO UP TO MY FATHER AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS YOUR SON JOSEPH GOD HAS MADE ME LORD OF ALL EGYPT

COME DOWN TO ME; DO NOT TARRY

YOU SHALL DWELL IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN AND YOU SHALL BE NEAR ME YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND YOUR FLOCKS YOUR HERDS AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE

THERE I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU FOR THERE ARE YET FIVE YEARS OF FAMINE TO COME SO THAT YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DO NOT COME TO POVERTY

' AND NOW YOUR EYES SEE AND THE EYES OF MY BROTHER BENJAMIN SEE THAT IT IS MY MOUTH THAT SPEAKS TO YOU

YOU MUST TELL MY FATHER OF ALL MY HONOR IN EGYPT AND OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN

HURRY AND BRING MY FATHER DOWN HERE

 THEN HE FELL UPON HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN'S NECK AND WEPT AND BENJAMIN WEPT UPON HIS NECK

AND HE KISSED ALL HIS BROTHERS AND WEPT UPON THEM

AFTER THAT HIS BROTHERS TALKED WITH HIM

WHEN THE REPORT WAS HEARD IN PHARAOH'S HOUSE JOSEPH'S BROTHERS HAVE COME IT PLEASED PHARAOH AND HIS SERVANTS

AND PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH SAY TO YOUR BROTHERS 'DO THIS LOAD YOUR BEASTS AND GO BACK TO THE LAND OF CANAAN AND TAKE YOUR FATHER AND YOUR HOUSEHOLDS AND COME TO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND YOU SHALL EAT THE FAT OF THE LAND

' AND YOU JOSEPH ARE COMMANDED TO SAY 'DO THIS TAKE WAGONS FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES AND FOR YOUR WIVES AND BRING YOUR FATHER AND COME

HAVE NO CONCERN FOR YOUR GOODS FOR THE BEST OF ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT IS YOURS

' THE SONS OF ISRAEL DID SO AND JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF PHARAOH AND GAVE THEM PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY

TO EACH AND ALL OF THEM HE GAVE A CHANGE OF CLOTHES BUT TO BENJAMIN HE GAVE THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER AND FIVE CHANGES OF CLOTHES

TO HIS FATHER HE SENT AS FOLLOWS TEN DONKEYS LOADED WITH THE GOOD THINGS OF EGYPT AND TEN FEMALE DONKEYS LOADED WITH GRAIN BREAD AND PROVISION FOR HIS FATHER ON THE JOURNEY

THEN HE SENT HIS BROTHERS AWAY AND AS THEY DEPARTED HE SAID TO THEM DO NOT QUARREL ON THE WAY

 SO THEY WENT UP OUT OF EGYPT AND CAME TO THE LAND OF CANAAN TO THEIR FATHER JACOB

AND THEY TOLD HIM JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE AND HE IS RULER OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

 AND HIS HEART BECAME NUMB FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM

BUT WHEN THEY TOLD HIM ALL THE WORDS OF JOSEPH WHICH HE HAD SAID TO THEM AND WHEN HE SAW THE WAGONS THAT JOSEPH HAD SENT TO CARRY HIM THE SPIRIT OF THEIR FATHER JACOB REVIVED

AND ISRAEL SAID IT IS ENOUGH; JOSEPH MY SON IS STILL ALIVE

I WILL GO AND SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE

SO ISRAEL TOOK HIS JOURNEY WITH ALL THAT HE HAD AND CAME TO BEERSHEBA AND OFFERED SACRIFICES TO THE GOD OF HIS FATHER ISAAC

AND GOD SPOKE TO ISRAEL IN VISIONS OF THE NIGHT AND SAID JACOB JACOB

 AND HE SAID HERE AM I

 THEN HE SAID I AM GOD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO GO DOWN TO EGYPT FOR THERE I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION

I MYSELF WILL GO DOWN WITH YOU TO EGYPT AND I WILL ALSO BRING YOU UP AGAIN AND JOSEPH'S HAND SHALL CLOSE YOUR EYES

 THEN JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA

THE SONS OF ISRAEL CARRIED JACOB THEIR FATHER THEIR LITTLE ONES AND THEIR WIVES IN THE WAGONS THAT PHARAOH HAD SENT TO CARRY HIM

THEY ALSO TOOK THEIR LIVESTOCK AND THEIR GOODS WHICH THEY HAD GAINED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN AND CAME INTO EGYPT JACOB AND ALL HIS OFFSPRING WITH HIM HIS SONS AND HIS SONS' SONS WITH HIM HIS DAUGHTERS AND HIS SONS' DAUGHTERS

ALL HIS OFFSPRING HE BROUGHT WITH HIM INTO EGYPT

NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE DESCENDANTS OF ISRAEL WHO CAME INTO EGYPT JACOB AND HIS SONS

THESE ARE THE SONS OF BILHAH WHOM LABAN GAVE TO RACHEL HIS DAUGHTER AND THESE SHE BORE TO JACOBSEVEN PERSONS IN ALL

ALL THE PERSONS BELONGING TO JACOB WHO CAME INTO EGYPT WHO WERE HIS OWN DESCENDANTS NOT INCLUDING JACOB'S SONS' WIVES WERE SIXTYSIX PERSONS IN ALL

AND THE SONS OF JOSEPH WHO WERE BORN TO HIM IN EGYPT WERE TWO

ALL THE PERSONS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB WHO CAME INTO EGYPT WERE SEVENTY

HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM TO JOSEPH TO SHOW THE WAY BEFORE HIM IN GOSHEN AND THEY CAME INTO THE LAND OF GOSHEN

THEN JOSEPH PREPARED HIS CHARIOT AND WENT UP TO MEET ISRAEL HIS FATHER IN GOSHEN

HE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO HIM AND FELL ON HIS NECK AND WEPT ON HIS NECK A GOOD WHILE

ISRAEL SAID TO JOSEPH NOW LET ME DIE SINCE I HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE STILL ALIVE

 JOSEPH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS AND TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD I WILL GO UP AND TELL PHARAOH AND WILL SAY TO HIM 'MY BROTHERS AND MY FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD WHO WERE IN THE LAND OF CANAAN HAVE COME TO ME

AND THE MEN ARE SHEPHERDS FOR THEY HAVE BEEN KEEPERS OF LIVESTOCK AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR HERDS AND ALL THAT THEY HAVE

' WHEN PHARAOH CALLS YOU AND SAYS 'WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION

' YOU SHALL SAY 'YOUR SERVANTS HAVE BEEN KEEPERS OF LIVESTOCK FROM OUR YOUTH EVEN UNTIL NOW BOTH WE AND OUR FATHERS' IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY DWELL IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN FOR EVERY SHEPHERD IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE EGYPTIANS

SO JOSEPH WENT IN AND TOLD PHARAOH MY FATHER AND MY BROTHERS WITH THEIR FLOCKS AND HERDS AND ALL THAT THEY POSSESS HAVE COME FROM THE LAND OF CANAAN

THEY ARE NOW IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN

 AND FROM AMONG HIS BROTHERS HE TOOK FIVE MEN AND PRESENTED THEM TO PHARAOH

PHARAOH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION

 AND THEY SAID TO PHARAOH YOUR SERVANTS ARE SHEPHERDS AS OUR FATHERS WERE

 THEY SAID TO PHARAOH WE HAVE COME TO SOJOURN IN THE LAND FOR THERE IS NO PASTURE FOR YOUR SERVANTS' FLOCKS FOR THE FAMINE IS SEVERE IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANTS DWELL IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN

 THEN PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH YOUR FATHER AND YOUR BROTHERS HAVE COME TO YOU

THE LAND OF EGYPT IS BEFORE YOU

SETTLE YOUR FATHER AND YOUR BROTHERS IN THE BEST OF THE LAND

LET THEM SETTLE IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN AND IF YOU KNOW ANY ABLE MEN AMONG THEM PUT THEM IN CHARGE OF MY LIVESTOCK

 THEN JOSEPH BROUGHT IN JACOB HIS FATHER AND STOOD HIM BEFORE PHARAOH AND JACOB BLESSED PHARAOH

AND PHARAOH SAID TO JACOB HOW MANY ARE THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE

 AND JACOB SAID TO PHARAOH THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF MY SOJOURNING ARE  YEARS

FEW AND EVIL HAVE BEEN THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF MY LIFE AND THEY HAVE NOT ATTAINED TO THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF MY FATHERS IN THE DAYS OF THEIR SOJOURNING

 AND JACOB BLESSED PHARAOH AND WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF PHARAOH

THEN JOSEPH SETTLED HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS AND GAVE THEM A POSSESSION IN THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE BEST OF THE LAND IN THE LAND OF RAMESES AS PHARAOH HAD COMMANDED

AND JOSEPH PROVIDED HIS FATHER HIS BROTHERS AND ALL HIS FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD WITH FOOD ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THEIR DEPENDENTS

NOW THERE WAS NO FOOD IN ALL THE LAND FOR THE FAMINE WAS VERY SEVERE SO THAT THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LAND OF CANAAN LANGUISHED BY REASON OF THE FAMINE

AND JOSEPH GATHERED UP ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS FOUND IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND IN THE LAND OF CANAAN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GRAIN THAT THEY BOUGHT

AND JOSEPH BROUGHT THE MONEY INTO PHARAOH'S HOUSE

AND WHEN THE MONEY WAS ALL SPENT IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND IN THE LAND OF CANAAN ALL THE EGYPTIANS CAME TO JOSEPH AND SAID GIVE US FOOD

WHY SHOULD WE DIE BEFORE YOUR EYES

FOR OUR MONEY IS GONE

 AND JOSEPH ANSWERED GIVE YOUR LIVESTOCK AND I WILL GIVE YOU FOOD IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR LIVESTOCK IF YOUR MONEY IS GONE

 SO THEY BROUGHT THEIR LIVESTOCK TO JOSEPH AND JOSEPH GAVE THEM FOOD IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HORSES THE FLOCKS THE HERDS AND THE DONKEYS

HE SUPPLIED THEM WITH FOOD IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL THEIR LIVESTOCK THAT YEAR

AND WHEN THAT YEAR WAS ENDED THEY CAME TO HIM THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SAID TO HIM WE WILL NOT HIDE FROM MY LORD THAT OUR MONEY IS ALL SPENT

THE HERDS OF LIVESTOCK ARE MY LORD'S

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE SIGHT OF MY LORD BUT OUR BODIES AND OUR LAND

WHY SHOULD WE DIE BEFORE YOUR EYES BOTH WE AND OUR LAND

BUY US AND OUR LAND FOR FOOD AND WE WITH OUR LAND WILL BE SERVANTS TO PHARAOH

AND GIVE US SEED THAT WE MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE AND THAT THE LAND MAY NOT BE DESOLATE

 SO JOSEPH BOUGHT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR PHARAOH FOR ALL THE EGYPTIANS SOLD THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE ON THEM

THE LAND BECAME PHARAOH'S

AS FOR THE PEOPLE HE MADE SERVANTS OF THEM FROM ONE END OF EGYPT TO THE OTHER

ONLY THE LAND OF THE PRIESTS HE DID NOT BUY FOR THE PRIESTS HAD A FIXED ALLOWANCE FROM PHARAOH AND LIVED ON THE ALLOWANCE THAT PHARAOH GAVE THEM; THEREFORE THEY DID NOT SELL THEIR LAND

THEN JOSEPH SAID TO THE PEOPLE BEHOLD I HAVE THIS DAY BOUGHT YOU AND YOUR LAND FOR PHARAOH

NOW HERE IS SEED FOR YOU AND YOU SHALL SOW THE LAND

AND AT THE HARVESTS YOU SHALL GIVE A FIFTH TO PHARAOH AND FOUR FIFTHS SHALL BE YOUR OWN AS SEED FOR THE FIELD AND AS FOOD FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR HOUSEHOLDS AND AS FOOD FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES

 AND THEY SAID YOU HAVE SAVED OUR LIVES; MAY IT PLEASE MY LORD WE WILL BE SERVANTS TO PHARAOH

 SO JOSEPH MADE IT A STATUTE CONCERNING THE LAND OF EGYPT AND IT STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT PHARAOH SHOULD HAVE THE FIFTH; THE LAND OF THE PRIESTS ALONE DID NOT BECOME PHARAOH'S

THUS ISRAEL SETTLED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN

AND THEY GAINED POSSESSIONS IN IT AND WERE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLIED GREATLY

AND JACOB LIVED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SEVENTEEN YEARS

SO THE DAYS OF JACOB THE YEARS OF HIS LIFE WERE  YEARS

AND WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR THAT ISRAEL MUST DIE HE CALLED HIS SON JOSEPH AND SAID TO HIM IF NOW I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH AND PROMISE TO DEAL KINDLY AND TRULY WITH ME

DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT BUT LET ME LIE WITH MY FATHERS

CARRY ME OUT OF EGYPT AND BURY ME IN THEIR BURYING PLACE

 HE ANSWERED I WILL DO AS YOU HAVE SAID

 AND HE SAID SWEAR TO ME; AND HE SWORE TO HIM

THEN ISRAEL BOWED HIMSELF UPON THE HEAD OF HIS BED

AFTER THIS JOSEPH WAS TOLD BEHOLD YOUR FATHER IS ILL

 SO HE TOOK WITH HIM HIS TWO SONS MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM

AND IT WAS TOLD TO JACOB YOUR SON JOSEPH HAS COME TO YOU

 THEN ISRAEL SUMMONED HIS STRENGTH AND SAT UP IN BED

AND JACOB SAID TO JOSEPH GOD ALMIGHTY APPEARED TO ME AT LUZ IN THE LAND OF CANAAN AND BLESSED ME AND SAID TO ME 'BEHOLD I WILL MAKE YOU FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY YOU AND I WILL MAKE OF YOU A COMPANY OF PEOPLES AND WILL GIVE THIS LAND TO YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU FOR AN EVERLASTING POSSESSION

' AND NOW YOUR TWO SONS WHO WERE BORN TO YOU IN THE LAND OF EGYPT BEFORE I CAME TO YOU IN EGYPT ARE MINE; EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH SHALL BE MINE AS REUBEN AND SIMEON ARE

AND THE CHILDREN THAT YOU FATHERED AFTER THEM SHALL BE YOURS

THEY SHALL BE CALLED BY THE NAME OF THEIR BROTHERS IN THEIR INHERITANCE

AS FOR ME WHEN I CAME FROM PADDAN TO MY SORROW RACHEL DIED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN ON THE WAY WHEN THERE WAS STILL SOME DISTANCE TO GO TO EPHRATH AND I BURIED HER THERE ON THE WAY TO EPHRATH THAT IS BETHLEHEM

 WHEN ISRAEL SAW JOSEPH'S SONS HE SAID WHO ARE THESE

 JOSEPH SAID TO HIS FATHER THEY ARE MY SONS WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME HERE

 AND HE SAID BRING THEM TO ME PLEASE THAT I MAY BLESS THEM

 NOW THE EYES OF ISRAEL WERE DIM WITH AGE SO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE

SO JOSEPH BROUGHT THEM NEAR HIM AND HE KISSED THEM AND EMBRACED THEM

AND ISRAEL SAID TO JOSEPH I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE YOUR FACE; AND BEHOLD GOD HAS LET ME SEE YOUR OFFSPRING ALSO

 THEN JOSEPH REMOVED THEM FROM HIS KNEES AND HE BOWED HIMSELF WITH HIS FACE TO THE EARTH

AND JOSEPH TOOK THEM BOTH EPHRAIM IN HIS RIGHT HAND TOWARD ISRAEL'S LEFT HAND AND MANASSEH IN HIS LEFT HAND TOWARD ISRAEL'S RIGHT HAND AND BROUGHT THEM NEAR HIM

AND ISRAEL STRETCHED OUT HIS RIGHT HAND AND LAID IT ON THE HEAD OF EPHRAIM WHO WAS THE YOUNGER AND HIS LEFT HAND ON THE HEAD OF MANASSEH CROSSING HIS HANDS FOR MANASSEH WAS THE FIRSTBORN

AND HE BLESSED JOSEPH AND SAID THE GOD BEFORE WHOM MY FATHERS ABRAHAM AND ISAAC WALKED THE GOD WHO HAS BEEN MY SHEPHERD ALL MY LIFE LONG TO THIS DAY THE ANGEL WHO HAS REDEEMED ME FROM ALL EVIL BLESS THE BOYS; AND IN THEM LET MY NAME BE CARRIED ON AND THE NAME OF MY FATHERS ABRAHAM AND ISAAC; AND LET THEM GROW INTO A MULTITUDE IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH

 WHEN JOSEPH SAW THAT HIS FATHER LAID HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE HEAD OF EPHRAIM IT DISPLEASED HIM AND HE TOOK HIS FATHER'S HAND TO MOVE IT FROM EPHRAIM'S HEAD TO MANASSEH'S HEAD

AND JOSEPH SAID TO HIS FATHER NOT THIS WAY MY FATHER; SINCE THIS ONE IS THE FIRSTBORN PUT YOUR RIGHT HAND ON HIS HEAD

 BUT HIS FATHER REFUSED AND SAID I KNOW MY SON I KNOW

HE ALSO SHALL BECOME A PEOPLE AND HE ALSO SHALL BE GREAT

NEVERTHELESS HIS YOUNGER BROTHER SHALL BE GREATER THAN HE AND HIS OFFSPRING SHALL BECOME A MULTITUDE OF NATIONS

 SO HE BLESSED THEM THAT DAY SAYING BY YOU ISRAEL WILL PRONOUNCE BLESSINGS SAYING 'GOD MAKE YOU AS EPHRAIM AND AS MANASSEH

'THUS HE PUT EPHRAIM BEFORE MANASSEH

THEN ISRAEL SAID TO JOSEPH BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO DIE BUT GOD WILL BE WITH YOU AND WILL BRING YOU AGAIN TO THE LAND OF YOUR FATHERS

MOREOVER I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU RATHER THAN TO YOUR BROTHERS ONE MOUNTAIN SLOPE THAT I TOOK FROM THE HAND OF THE AMORITES WITH MY SWORD AND WITH MY BOW

THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS AND SAID GATHER YOURSELVES TOGETHER THAT I MAY TELL YOU WHAT SHALL HAPPEN TO YOU IN DAYS TO COME

ASSEMBLE AND LISTEN O SONS OF JACOB LISTEN TO ISRAEL YOUR FATHER

REUBEN YOU ARE MY FIRSTBORN MY MIGHT AND THE FIRSTFRUITS OF MY STRENGTH PREEMINENT IN DIGNITY AND PREEMINENT IN POWER

UNSTABLE AS WATER YOU SHALL NOT HAVE PREEMINENCE BECAUSE YOU WENT UP TO YOUR FATHER'S BED; THEN YOU DEFILED ITHE WENT UP TO MY COUCH

SIMEON AND LEVI ARE BROTHERS; WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE ARE THEIR SWORDS

LET MY SOUL COME NOT INTO THEIR COUNCIL; O MY GLORY BE NOT JOINED TO THEIR COMPANY

FOR IN THEIR ANGER THEY KILLED MEN AND IN THEIR WILLFULNESS THEY HAMSTRUNG OXEN

CURSED BE THEIR ANGER FOR IT IS FIERCE AND THEIR WRATH FOR IT IS CRUEL

I WILL DIVIDE THEM IN JACOB AND SCATTER THEM IN ISRAEL

JUDAH YOUR BROTHERS SHALL PRAISE YOU; YOUR HAND SHALL BE ON THE NECK OF YOUR ENEMIES; YOUR FATHER'S SONS SHALL BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU

JUDAH IS A LION'S CUB; FROM THE PREY MY SON YOU HAVE GONE UP

HE STOOPED DOWN; HE CROUCHED AS A LION AND AS A LIONESS; WHO DARES ROUSE HIM

THE SCEPTER SHALL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH NOR THE RULER'S STAFF FROM BETWEEN HIS FEET UNTIL TRIBUTE COMES TO HIM; AND TO HIM SHALL BE THE OBEDIENCE OF THE PEOPLES

BINDING HIS FOAL TO THE VINE AND HIS DONKEY'S COLT TO THE CHOICE VINE HE HAS WASHED HIS GARMENTS IN WINE AND HIS VESTURE IN THE BLOOD OF GRAPES

HIS EYES ARE DARKER THAN WINE AND HIS TEETH WHITER THAN MILK

ZEBULUN SHALL DWELL AT THE SHORE OF THE SEA; HE SHALL BECOME A HAVEN FOR SHIPS AND HIS BORDER SHALL BE AT SIDON

ISSACHAR IS A STRONG DONKEY CROUCHING BETWEEN THE SHEEPFOLDS

HE SAW THAT A RESTING PLACE WAS GOOD AND THAT THE LAND WAS PLEASANT SO HE BOWED HIS SHOULDER TO BEAR AND BECAME A SERVANT AT FORCED LABOR

DAN SHALL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE AS ONE OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

DAN SHALL BE A SERPENT IN THE WAY A VIPER BY THE PATH THAT BITES THE HORSE'S HEELS SO THAT HIS RIDER FALLS BACKWARD

I WAIT FOR YOUR SALVATION O LORD

RAIDERS SHALL RAID GAD BUT HE SHALL RAID AT THEIR HEELS

ASHER'S FOOD SHALL BE RICH AND HE SHALL YIELD ROYAL DELICACIES

NAPHTALI IS A DOE LET LOOSE THAT BEARS BEAUTIFUL FAWNS

JOSEPH IS A FRUITFUL BOUGH A FRUITFUL BOUGH BY A SPRING; HIS BRANCHES RUN OVER THE WALL

THE ARCHERS BITTERLY ATTACKED HIM SHOT AT HIM AND HARASSED HIM SEVERELY YET HIS BOW REMAINED UNMOVED; HIS ARMS WERE MADE AGILE BY THE HANDS OF THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB FROM THERE IS THE SHEPHERD THE STONE OF ISRAEL BY THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER WHO WILL HELP YOU BY THE ALMIGHTY WHO WILL BLESS YOU WITH BLESSINGS OF HEAVEN ABOVE BLESSINGS OF THE DEEP THAT CROUCHES BENEATH BLESSINGS OF THE BREASTS AND OF THE WOMB

THE BLESSINGS OF YOUR FATHER ARE MIGHTY BEYOND THE BLESSINGS OF MY PARENTS UP TO THE BOUNTIES OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS

MAY THEY BE ON THE HEAD OF JOSEPH AND ON THE BROW OF HIM WHO WAS SET APART FROM HIS BROTHERS

BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF IN THE MORNING DEVOURING THE PREY AND AT EVENING DIVIDING THE SPOIL

 ALL THESE ARE THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SAID TO THEM AS HE BLESSED THEM BLESSING EACH WITH THE BLESSING SUITABLE TO HIM

THEN HE COMMANDED THEM AND SAID TO THEM I AM TO BE GATHERED TO MY PEOPLE; BURY ME WITH MY FATHERS IN THE CAVE THAT IS IN THE FIELD OF EPHRON THE HITTITE IN THE CAVE THAT IS IN THE FIELD AT MACHPELAH TO THE EAST OF MAMRE IN THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH ABRAHAM BOUGHT WITH THE FIELD FROM EPHRON THE HITTITE TO POSSESS AS A BURYING PLACE

THERE THEY BURIED ABRAHAM AND SARAH HIS WIFE

THERE THEY BURIED ISAAC AND REBEKAH HIS WIFE AND THERE I BURIED LEAH THE FIELD AND THE CAVE THAT IS IN IT WERE BOUGHT FROM THE HITTITES

 WHEN JACOB FINISHED COMMANDING HIS SONS HE DREW UP HIS FEET INTO THE BED AND BREATHED HIS LAST AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE

THEN JOSEPH FELL ON HIS FATHER'S FACE AND WEPT OVER HIM AND KISSED HIM

AND JOSEPH COMMANDED HIS SERVANTS THE PHYSICIANS TO EMBALM HIS FATHER

SO THE PHYSICIANS EMBALMED ISRAEL

FORTY DAYS WERE REQUIRED FOR IT FOR THAT IS HOW MANY ARE REQUIRED FOR EMBALMING

AND THE EGYPTIANS WEPT FOR HIM SEVENTY DAYS

AND WHEN THE DAYS OF WEEPING FOR HIM WERE PAST JOSEPH SPOKE TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF PHARAOH SAYING IF NOW I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES PLEASE SPEAK IN THE EARS OF PHARAOH SAYING MY FATHER MADE ME SWEAR SAYING 'I AM ABOUT TO DIE IN MY TOMB THAT I HEWED OUT FOR MYSELF IN THE LAND OF CANAAN THERE SHALL YOU BURY ME

' NOW THEREFORE LET ME PLEASE GO UP AND BURY MY FATHER

THEN I WILL RETURN

 AND PHARAOH ANSWERED GO UP AND BURY YOUR FATHER AS HE MADE YOU SWEAR

 SO JOSEPH WENT UP TO BURY HIS FATHER

WITH HIM WENT UP ALL THE SERVANTS OF PHARAOH THE ELDERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND ALL THE ELDERS OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AS WELL AS ALL THE HOUSEHOLD OF JOSEPH HIS BROTHERS AND HIS FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD

ONLY THEIR CHILDREN THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR HERDS WERE LEFT IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN

AND THERE WENT UP WITH HIM BOTH CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN

IT WAS A VERY GREAT COMPANY

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ATAD WHICH IS BEYOND THE JORDAN THEY LAMENTED THERE WITH A VERY GREAT AND GRIEVOUS LAMENTATION AND HE MADE A MOURNING FOR HIS FATHER SEVEN DAYS

WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND THE CANAANITES SAW THE MOURNING ON THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ATAD THEY SAID THIS IS A GRIEVOUS MOURNING BY THE EGYPTIANS

 THEREFORE THE PLACE WAS NAMED ABELMIZRAIM; IT IS BEYOND THE JORDAN

THUS HIS SONS DID FOR HIM AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM FOR HIS SONS CARRIED HIM TO THE LAND OF CANAAN AND BURIED HIM IN THE CAVE OF THE FIELD AT MACHPELAH TO THE EAST OF MAMRE WHICH ABRAHAM BOUGHT WITH THE FIELD FROM EPHRON THE HITTITE TO POSSESS AS A BURYING PLACE

AFTER HE HAD BURIED HIS FATHER JOSEPH RETURNED TO EGYPT WITH HIS BROTHERS AND ALL WHO HAD GONE UP WITH HIM TO BURY HIS FATHER

WHEN JOSEPH'S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD THEY SAID IT MAY BE THAT JOSEPH WILL HATE US AND PAY US BACK FOR ALL THE EVIL THAT WE DID TO HIM

 SO THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO JOSEPH SAYING YOUR FATHER GAVE THIS COMMAND BEFORE HE DIED 'SAY TO JOSEPH PLEASE FORGIVE THE TRANSGRESSION OF YOUR BROTHERS AND THEIR SIN BECAUSE THEY DID EVIL TO YOU

' AND NOW PLEASE FORGIVE THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE SERVANTS OF THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER

 JOSEPH WEPT WHEN THEY SPOKE TO HIM

HIS BROTHERS ALSO CAME AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM AND SAID BEHOLD WE ARE YOUR SERVANTS

 BUT JOSEPH SAID TO THEM DO NOT FEAR FOR AM I IN THE PLACE OF GOD

AS FOR YOU YOU MEANT EVIL AGAINST ME BUT GOD MEANT IT FOR GOOD TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE KEPT ALIVE AS THEY ARE TODAY

SO DO NOT FEAR; I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ONES

 THUS HE COMFORTED THEM AND SPOKE KINDLY TO THEM

SO JOSEPH REMAINED IN EGYPT HE AND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

JOSEPH LIVED  YEARS

AND JOSEPH SAW EPHRAIM'S CHILDREN OF THE THIRD GENERATION

THE CHILDREN ALSO OF MACHIR THE SON OF MANASSEH WERE COUNTED AS JOSEPH'S OWN

AND JOSEPH SAID TO HIS BROTHERS I AM ABOUT TO DIE BUT GOD WILL VISIT YOU AND BRING YOU UP OUT OF THIS LAND TO THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB

 THEN JOSEPH MADE THE SONS OF ISRAEL SWEAR SAYING GOD WILL SURELY VISIT YOU AND YOU SHALL CARRY UP MY BONES FROM HERE

 SO JOSEPH DIED BEING  YEARS OLD

THEY EMBALMED HIM AND HE WAS PUT IN A COFFIN IN EGYPT

 SAMUELAFTER THE DEATH OF SAUL WHEN DAVID HAD RETURNED FROM STRIKING DOWN THE AMALEKITES DAVID REMAINED TWO DAYS IN ZIKLAG

AND ON THE THIRD DAY BEHOLD A MAN CAME FROM SAUL'S CAMP WITH HIS CLOTHES TORN AND DIRT ON HIS HEAD

AND WHEN HE CAME TO DAVID HE FELL TO THE GROUND AND PAID HOMAGE

DAVID SAID TO HIM WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 AND HE SAID TO HIM I HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE CAMP OF ISRAEL

 AND DAVID SAID TO HIM HOW DID IT GO

TELL ME

 AND HE ANSWERED THE PEOPLE FLED FROM THE BATTLE AND ALSO MANY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN AND ARE DEAD AND SAUL AND HIS SON JONATHAN ARE ALSO DEAD

 THEN DAVID SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SAUL AND HIS SON JONATHAN ARE DEAD

 AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HIM SAID BY CHANCE I HAPPENED TO BE ON MOUNT GILBOA AND THERE WAS SAUL LEANING ON HIS SPEAR AND BEHOLD THE CHARIOTS AND THE HORSEMEN WERE CLOSE UPON HIM

AND WHEN HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM HE SAW ME AND CALLED TO ME

AND I ANSWERED 'HERE I AM

' AND HE SAID TO ME 'WHO ARE YOU

' I ANSWERED HIM 'I AM AN AMALEKITE

' AND HE SAID TO ME 'STAND BESIDE ME AND KILL ME FOR ANGUISH HAS SEIZED ME AND YET MY LIFE STILL LINGERS

' SO I STOOD BESIDE HIM AND KILLED HIM BECAUSE I WAS SURE THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE AFTER HE HAD FALLEN

AND I TOOK THE CROWN THAT WAS ON HIS HEAD AND THE ARMLET THAT WAS ON HIS ARM AND I HAVE BROUGHT THEM HERE TO MY LORD

 THEN DAVID TOOK HOLD OF HIS CLOTHES AND TORE THEM AND SO DID ALL THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND THEY MOURNED AND WEPT AND FASTED UNTIL EVENING FOR SAUL AND FOR JONATHAN HIS SON AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD AND FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY HAD FALLEN BY THE SWORD

AND DAVID SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HIM WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE SON OF A SOJOURNER AN AMALEKITE

 DAVID SAID TO HIM HOW IS IT YOU WERE NOT AFRAID TO PUT OUT YOUR HAND TO DESTROY THE LORD'S ANOINTED

 THEN DAVID CALLED ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN AND SAID GO EXECUTE HIM

 AND HE STRUCK HIM DOWN SO THAT HE DIED

AND DAVID SAID TO HIM YOUR BLOOD BE ON YOUR HEAD FOR YOUR OWN MOUTH HAS TESTIFIED AGAINST YOU SAYING 'I HAVE KILLED THE LORD'S ANOINTED

' AND DAVID LAMENTED WITH THIS LAMENTATION OVER SAUL AND JONATHAN HIS SON AND HE SAID IT SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH; BEHOLD IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF JASHAR

HE SAID YOUR GLORY O ISRAEL IS SLAIN ON YOUR HIGH PLACES

HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN

TELL IT NOT IN GATH PUBLISH IT NOT IN THE STREETS OF ASHKELON LEST THE DAUGHTERS OF THE PHILISTINES REJOICE LEST THE DAUGHTERS OF THE UNCIRCUMCISED EXULT

YOU MOUNTAINS OF GILBOA LET THERE BE NO DEW OR RAIN UPON YOU NOR FIELDS OF OFFERINGS

FOR THERE THE SHIELD OF THE MIGHTY WAS DEFILED THE SHIELD OF SAUL NOT ANOINTED WITH OIL

FROM THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN FROM THE FAT OF THE MIGHTY THE BOW OF JONATHAN TURNED NOT BACK AND THE SWORD OF SAUL RETURNED NOT EMPTY

SAUL AND JONATHAN BELOVED AND LOVELY

IN LIFE AND IN DEATH THEY WERE NOT DIVIDED; THEY WERE SWIFTER THAN EAGLES; THEY WERE STRONGER THAN LIONS

YOU DAUGHTERS OF ISRAEL WEEP OVER SAUL WHO CLOTHED YOU LUXURIOUSLY IN SCARLET WHO PUT ORNAMENTS OF GOLD ON YOUR APPAREL

HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN IN THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE

JONATHAN LIES SLAIN ON YOUR HIGH PLACES

I AM DISTRESSED FOR YOU MY BROTHER JONATHAN; VERY PLEASANT HAVE YOU BEEN TO ME; YOUR LOVE TO ME WAS EXTRAORDINARY SURPASSING THE LOVE OF WOMEN

HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED

AFTER THIS DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD SHALL I GO UP INTO ANY OF THE CITIES OF JUDAH

 AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM GO UP

 DAVID SAID TO WHICH SHALL I GO UP

 AND HE SAID TO HEBRON

 SO DAVID WENT UP THERE AND HIS TWO WIVES ALSO AHINOAM OF JEZREEL AND ABIGAIL THE WIDOW OF NABAL OF CARMEL

AND DAVID BROUGHT UP HIS MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM EVERYONE WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD AND THEY LIVED IN THE TOWNS OF HEBRON

AND THE MEN OF JUDAH CAME AND THERE THEY ANOINTED DAVID KING OVER THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

WHEN THEY TOLD DAVID IT WAS THE MEN OF JABESHGILEAD WHO BURIED SAUL DAVID SENT MESSENGERS TO THE MEN OF JABESHGILEAD AND SAID TO THEM MAY YOU BE BLESSED BY THE LORD BECAUSE YOU SHOWED THIS LOYALTY TO SAUL YOUR LORD AND BURIED HIM

NOW MAY THE LORD SHOW STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO YOU

AND I WILL DO GOOD TO YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS THING

NOW THEREFORE LET YOUR HANDS BE STRONG AND BE VALIANT FOR SAUL YOUR LORD IS DEAD AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH HAS ANOINTED ME KING OVER THEM

 BUT ABNER THE SON OF NER COMMANDER OF SAUL'S ARMY TOOK ISHBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL AND BROUGHT HIM OVER TO MAHANAIM AND HE MADE HIM KING OVER GILEAD AND THE ASHURITES AND JEZREEL AND EPHRAIM AND BENJAMIN AND ALL ISRAEL

ISHBOSHETH SAUL'S SON WAS FORTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL AND HE REIGNED TWO YEARS

BUT THE HOUSE OF JUDAH FOLLOWED DAVID

AND THE TIME THAT DAVID WAS KING IN HEBRON OVER THE HOUSE OF JUDAH WAS SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS

ABNER THE SON OF NER AND THE SERVANTS OF ISHBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL WENT OUT FROM MAHANAIM TO GIBEON

AND JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH AND THE SERVANTS OF DAVID WENT OUT AND MET THEM AT THE POOL OF GIBEON

AND THEY SAT DOWN THE ONE ON THE ONE SIDE OF THE POOL AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL

AND ABNER SAID TO JOAB LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND COMPETE BEFORE US

 AND JOAB SAID LET THEM ARISE

 THEN THEY AROSE AND PASSED OVER BY NUMBER TWELVE FOR BENJAMIN AND ISHBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL AND TWELVE OF THE SERVANTS OF DAVID

AND EACH CAUGHT HIS OPPONENT BY THE HEAD AND THRUST HIS SWORD IN HIS OPPONENT'S SIDE SO THEY FELL DOWN TOGETHER

THEREFORE THAT PLACE WAS CALLED HELKATHHAZZURIM WHICH IS AT GIBEON

AND THE BATTLE WAS VERY FIERCE THAT DAY

AND ABNER AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE BEATEN BEFORE THE SERVANTS OF DAVID

AND THE THREE SONS OF ZERUIAH WERE THERE JOAB ABISHAI AND ASAHEL

NOW ASAHEL WAS AS SWIFT OF FOOT AS A WILD GAZELLE

AND ASAHEL PURSUED ABNER AND AS HE WENT HE TURNED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR TO THE LEFT FROM FOLLOWING ABNER

THEN ABNER LOOKED BEHIND HIM AND SAID IS IT YOU ASAHEL

 AND HE ANSWERED IT IS I

 ABNER SAID TO HIM TURN ASIDE TO YOUR RIGHT HAND OR TO YOUR LEFT AND SEIZE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN AND TAKE HIS SPOIL

 BUT ASAHEL WOULD NOT TURN ASIDE FROM FOLLOWING HIM

AND ABNER SAID AGAIN TO ASAHEL TURN ASIDE FROM FOLLOWING ME

WHY SHOULD I STRIKE YOU TO THE GROUND

HOW THEN COULD I LIFT UP MY FACE TO YOUR BROTHER JOAB

 BUT HE REFUSED TO TURN ASIDE

THEREFORE ABNER STRUCK HIM IN THE STOMACH WITH THE BUTT OF HIS SPEAR SO THAT THE SPEAR CAME OUT AT HIS BACK

AND HE FELL THERE AND DIED WHERE HE WAS

AND ALL WHO CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE ASAHEL HAD FALLEN AND DIED STOOD STILL

BUT JOAB AND ABISHAI PURSUED ABNER

AND AS THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN THEY CAME TO THE HILL OF AMMAH WHICH LIES BEFORE GIAH ON THE WAY TO THE WILDERNESS OF GIBEON

AND THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER BEHIND ABNER AND BECAME ONE GROUP AND TOOK THEIR STAND ON THE TOP OF A HILL

THEN ABNER CALLED TO JOAB SHALL THE SWORD DEVOUR FOREVER

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE END WILL BE BITTER

HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE YOU TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO TURN FROM THE PURSUIT OF THEIR BROTHERS

 AND JOAB SAID AS GOD LIVES IF YOU HAD NOT SPOKEN SURELY THE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN UP THE PURSUIT OF THEIR BROTHERS UNTIL THE MORNING

 SO JOAB BLEW THE TRUMPET AND ALL THE MEN STOPPED AND PURSUED ISRAEL NO MORE NOR DID THEY FIGHT ANYMORE

AND ABNER AND HIS MEN WENT ALL THAT NIGHT THROUGH THE ARABAH

THEY CROSSED THE JORDAN AND MARCHING THE WHOLE MORNING THEY CAME TO MAHANAIM

JOAB RETURNED FROM THE PURSUIT OF ABNER

AND WHEN HE HAD GATHERED ALL THE PEOPLE TOGETHER THERE WERE MISSING FROM DAVID'S SERVANTS NINETEEN MEN BESIDES ASAHEL

BUT THE SERVANTS OF DAVID HAD STRUCK DOWN OF BENJAMIN  OF ABNER'S MEN

AND THEY TOOK UP ASAHEL AND BURIED HIM IN THE TOMB OF HIS FATHER WHICH WAS AT BETHLEHEM

AND JOAB AND HIS MEN MARCHED ALL NIGHT AND THE DAY BROKE UPON THEM AT HEBRON

THERE WAS A LONG WAR BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF SAUL AND THE HOUSE OF DAVID

AND DAVID GREW STRONGER AND STRONGER WHILE THE HOUSE OF SAUL BECAME WEAKER AND WEAKER

AND SONS WERE BORN TO DAVID AT HEBRON HIS FIRSTBORN WAS AMNON OF AHINOAM OF JEZREEL; AND HIS SECOND CHILEAB OF ABIGAIL THE WIDOW OF NABAL OF CARMEL; AND THE THIRD ABSALOM THE SON OF MAACAH THE DAUGHTER OF TALMAI KING OF GESHUR; AND THE FOURTH ADONIJAH THE SON OF HAGGITH; AND THE FIFTH SHEPHATIAH THE SON OF ABITAL; AND THE SIXTH ITHREAM OF EGLAH DAVID'S WIFE

THESE WERE BORN TO DAVID IN HEBRON

WHILE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF SAUL AND THE HOUSE OF DAVID ABNER WAS MAKING HIMSELF STRONG IN THE HOUSE OF SAUL

NOW SAUL HAD A CONCUBINE WHOSE NAME WAS RIZPAH THE DAUGHTER OF AIAH

AND ISHBOSHETH SAID TO ABNER WHY HAVE YOU GONE IN TO MY FATHER'S CONCUBINE

 THEN ABNER WAS VERY ANGRY OVER THE WORDS OF ISHBOSHETH AND SAID AM I A DOG'S HEAD OF JUDAH

TO THIS DAY I KEEP SHOWING STEADFAST LOVE TO THE HOUSE OF SAUL YOUR FATHER TO HIS BROTHERS AND TO HIS FRIENDS AND HAVE NOT GIVEN YOU INTO THE HAND OF DAVID

AND YET YOU CHARGE ME TODAY WITH A FAULT CONCERNING A WOMAN

GOD DO SO TO ABNER AND MORE ALSO IF I DO NOT ACCOMPLISH FOR DAVID WHAT THE LORD HAS SWORN TO HIM TO TRANSFER THE KINGDOM FROM THE HOUSE OF SAUL AND SET UP THE THRONE OF DAVID OVER ISRAEL AND OVER JUDAH FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA

 AND ISHBOSHETH COULD NOT ANSWER ABNER ANOTHER WORD BECAUSE HE FEARED HIM

AND ABNER SENT MESSENGERS TO DAVID ON HIS BEHALF SAYING TO WHOM DOES THE LAND BELONG

MAKE YOUR COVENANT WITH ME AND BEHOLD MY HAND SHALL BE WITH YOU TO BRING OVER ALL ISRAEL TO YOU

 AND HE SAID GOOD; I WILL MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU

BUT ONE THING I REQUIRE OF YOU; THAT IS YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE UNLESS YOU FIRST BRING MICHAL SAUL'S DAUGHTER WHEN YOU COME TO SEE MY FACE

 THEN DAVID SENT MESSENGERS TO ISHBOSHETH SAUL'S SON SAYING GIVE ME MY WIFE MICHAL FOR WHOM I PAID THE BRIDAL PRICE OF A HUNDRED FORESKINS OF THE PHILISTINES

 AND ISHBOSHETH SENT AND TOOK HER FROM HER HUSBAND PALTIEL THE SON OF LAISH

BUT HER HUSBAND WENT WITH HER WEEPING AFTER HER ALL THE WAY TO BAHURIM

THEN ABNER SAID TO HIM GO RETURN

 AND HE RETURNED

AND ABNER CONFERRED WITH THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL SAYING FOR SOME TIME PAST YOU HAVE BEEN SEEKING DAVID AS KING OVER YOU

NOW THEN BRING IT ABOUT FOR THE LORD HAS PROMISED DAVID SAYING 'BY THE HAND OF MY SERVANT DAVID I WILL SAVE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND FROM THE HAND OF ALL THEIR ENEMIES

' ABNER ALSO SPOKE TO BENJAMIN

AND THEN ABNER WENT TO TELL DAVID AT HEBRON ALL THAT ISRAEL AND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF BENJAMIN THOUGHT GOOD TO DO

WHEN ABNER CAME WITH TWENTY MEN TO DAVID AT HEBRON DAVID MADE A FEAST FOR ABNER AND THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND ABNER SAID TO DAVID I WILL ARISE AND GO AND WILL GATHER ALL ISRAEL TO MY LORD THE KING THAT THEY MAY MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY REIGN OVER ALL THAT YOUR HEART DESIRES

 SO DAVID SENT ABNER AWAY AND HE WENT IN PEACE

JUST THEN THE SERVANTS OF DAVID ARRIVED WITH JOAB FROM A RAID BRINGING MUCH SPOIL WITH THEM

BUT ABNER WAS NOT WITH DAVID AT HEBRON FOR HE HAD SENT HIM AWAY AND HE HAD GONE IN PEACE

WHEN JOAB AND ALL THE ARMY THAT WAS WITH HIM CAME IT WAS TOLD JOAB ABNER THE SON OF NER CAME TO THE KING AND HE HAS LET HIM GO AND HE HAS GONE IN PEACE

 THEN JOAB WENT TO THE KING AND SAID WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

BEHOLD ABNER CAME TO YOU

WHY IS IT THAT YOU HAVE SENT HIM AWAY SO THAT HE IS GONE

YOU KNOW THAT ABNER THE SON OF NER CAME TO DECEIVE YOU AND TO KNOW YOUR GOING OUT AND YOUR COMING IN AND TO KNOW ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING

 WHEN JOAB CAME OUT FROM DAVID'S PRESENCE HE SENT MESSENGERS AFTER ABNER AND THEY BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM THE CISTERN OF SIRAH

BUT DAVID DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT

AND WHEN ABNER RETURNED TO HEBRON JOAB TOOK HIM ASIDE INTO THE MIDST OF THE GATE TO SPEAK WITH HIM PRIVATELY AND THERE HE STRUCK HIM IN THE STOMACH SO THAT HE DIED FOR THE BLOOD OF ASAHEL HIS BROTHER

AFTERWARD WHEN DAVID HEARD OF IT HE SAID I AND MY KINGDOM ARE FOREVER GUILTLESS BEFORE THE LORD FOR THE BLOOD OF ABNER THE SON OF NER

MAY IT FALL UPON THE HEAD OF JOAB AND UPON ALL HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER BE WITHOUT ONE WHO HAS A DISCHARGE OR WHO IS LEPROUS OR WHO HOLDS A SPINDLE OR WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD OR WHO LACKS BREAD

 SO JOAB AND ABISHAI HIS BROTHER KILLED ABNER BECAUSE HE HAD PUT THEIR BROTHER ASAHEL TO DEATH IN THE BATTLE AT GIBEON

THEN DAVID SAID TO JOAB AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM TEAR YOUR CLOTHES AND PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND MOURN BEFORE ABNER

 AND KING DAVID FOLLOWED THE BIER

THEY BURIED ABNER AT HEBRON

AND THE KING LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT AT THE GRAVE OF ABNER AND ALL THE PEOPLE WEPT

AND THE KING LAMENTED FOR ABNER SAYING SHOULD ABNER DIE AS A FOOL DIES

YOUR HANDS WERE NOT BOUND; YOUR FEET WERE NOT FETTERED; AS ONE FALLS BEFORE THE WICKED YOU HAVE FALLEN

AND ALL THE PEOPLE WEPT AGAIN OVER HIM

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO PERSUADE DAVID TO EAT BREAD WHILE IT WAS YET DAY

BUT DAVID SWORE SAYING GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF I TASTE BREAD OR ANYTHING ELSE TILL THE SUN GOES DOWN

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK NOTICE OF IT AND IT PLEASED THEM AS EVERYTHING THAT THE KING DID PLEASED ALL THE PEOPLE

SO ALL THE PEOPLE AND ALL ISRAEL UNDERSTOOD THAT DAY THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN THE KING'S WILL TO PUT TO DEATH ABNER THE SON OF NER

AND THE KING SAID TO HIS SERVANTS DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN HAS FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL

AND I WAS GENTLE TODAY THOUGH ANOINTED KING

THESE MEN THE SONS OF ZERUIAH ARE MORE SEVERE THAN I

THE LORD REPAY THE EVILDOER ACCORDING TO HIS WICKEDNESS

WHEN ISHBOSHETH SAUL'S SON HEARD THAT ABNER HAD DIED AT HEBRON HIS COURAGE FAILED AND ALL ISRAEL WAS DISMAYED

NOW SAUL'S SON HAD TWO MEN WHO WERE CAPTAINS OF RAIDING BANDS; THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS BAANAH AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER RECHAB SONS OF RIMMON A MAN OF BENJAMIN FROM BEEROTH FOR BEEROTH ALSO IS COUNTED PART OF BENJAMIN; THE BEEROTHITES FLED TO GITTAIM AND HAVE BEEN SOJOURNERS THERE TO THIS DAY

JONATHAN THE SON OF SAUL HAD A SON WHO WAS CRIPPLED IN HIS FEET

HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN THE NEWS ABOUT SAUL AND JONATHAN CAME FROM JEZREEL AND HIS NURSE TOOK HIM UP AND FLED AND AS SHE FLED IN HER HASTE HE FELL AND BECAME LAME

AND HIS NAME WAS MEPHIBOSHETH

NOW THE SONS OF RIMMON THE BEEROTHITE RECHAB AND BAANAH SET OUT AND ABOUT THE HEAT OF THE DAY THEY CAME TO THE HOUSE OF ISHBOSHETH AS HE WAS TAKING HIS NOONDAY REST

AND THEY CAME INTO THE MIDST OF THE HOUSE AS IF TO GET WHEAT AND THEY STABBED HIM IN THE STOMACH

THEN RECHAB AND BAANAH HIS BROTHER ESCAPED

WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE HOUSE AS HE LAY ON HIS BED IN HIS BEDROOM THEY STRUCK HIM AND PUT HIM TO DEATH AND BEHEADED HIM

THEY TOOK HIS HEAD AND WENT BY THE WAY OF THE ARABAH ALL NIGHT AND BROUGHT THE HEAD OF ISHBOSHETH TO DAVID AT HEBRON

AND THEY SAID TO THE KING HERE IS THE HEAD OF ISHBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL YOUR ENEMY WHO SOUGHT YOUR LIFE

THE LORD HAS AVENGED MY LORD THE KING THIS DAY ON SAUL AND ON HIS OFFSPRING

 BUT DAVID ANSWERED RECHAB AND BAANAH HIS BROTHER THE SONS OF RIMMON THE BEEROTHITE AS THE LORD LIVES WHO HAS REDEEMED MY LIFE OUT OF EVERY ADVERSITY WHEN ONE TOLD ME 'BEHOLD SAUL IS DEAD' AND THOUGHT HE WAS BRINGING GOOD NEWS I SEIZED HIM AND KILLED HIM AT ZIKLAG WHICH WAS THE REWARD I GAVE HIM FOR HIS NEWS

HOW MUCH MORE WHEN WICKED MEN HAVE KILLED A RIGHTEOUS MAN IN HIS OWN HOUSE ON HIS BED SHALL I NOT NOW REQUIRE HIS BLOOD AT YOUR HAND AND DESTROY YOU FROM THE EARTH

 AND DAVID COMMANDED HIS YOUNG MEN AND THEY KILLED THEM AND CUT OFF THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND HANGED THEM BESIDE THE POOL AT HEBRON

BUT THEY TOOK THE HEAD OF ISHBOSHETH AND BURIED IT IN THE TOMB OF ABNER AT HEBRON

THEN ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL CAME TO DAVID AT HEBRON AND SAID BEHOLD WE ARE YOUR BONE AND FLESH

IN TIMES PAST WHEN SAUL WAS KING OVER US IT WAS YOU WHO LED OUT AND BROUGHT IN ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SAID TO YOU 'YOU SHALL BE SHEPHERD OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND YOU SHALL BE PRINCE OVER ISRAEL

' SO ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME TO THE KING AT HEBRON AND KING DAVID MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM AT HEBRON BEFORE THE LORD AND THEY ANOINTED DAVID KING OVER ISRAEL

DAVID WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FORTY YEARS

AT HEBRON HE REIGNED OVER JUDAH SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AND AT JERUSALEM HE REIGNED OVER ALL ISRAEL AND JUDAH THIRTYTHREE YEARS

AND THE KING AND HIS MEN WENT TO JERUSALEM AGAINST THE JEBUSITES THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND WHO SAID TO DAVID YOU WILL NOT COME IN HERE BUT THE BLIND AND THE LAME WILL WARD YOU OFFTHINKING DAVID CANNOT COME IN HERE

 NEVERTHELESS DAVID TOOK THE STRONGHOLD OF ZION THAT IS THE CITY OF DAVID

AND DAVID SAID ON THAT DAY WHOEVER WOULD STRIKE THE JEBUSITES LET HIM GET UP THE WATER SHAFT TO ATTACK 'THE LAME AND THE BLIND' WHO ARE HATED BY DAVID'S SOUL

 THEREFORE IT IS SAID THE BLIND AND THE LAME SHALL NOT COME INTO THE HOUSE

 AND DAVID LIVED IN THE STRONGHOLD AND CALLED IT THE CITY OF DAVID

AND DAVID BUILT THE CITY ALL AROUND FROM THE MILLO INWARD

AND DAVID BECAME GREATER AND GREATER FOR THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS WAS WITH HIM

AND HIRAM KING OF TYRE SENT MESSENGERS TO DAVID AND CEDAR TREES ALSO CARPENTERS AND MASONS WHO BUILT DAVID A HOUSE

AND DAVID KNEW THAT THE LORD HAD ESTABLISHED HIM KING OVER ISRAEL AND THAT HE HAD EXALTED HIS KINGDOM FOR THE SAKE OF HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND DAVID TOOK MORE CONCUBINES AND WIVES FROM JERUSALEM AFTER HE CAME FROM HEBRON AND MORE SONS AND DAUGHTERS WERE BORN TO DAVID

AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WERE BORN TO HIM IN JERUSALEM SHAMMUA SHOBAB NATHAN SOLOMON IBHAR ELISHUA NEPHEG JAPHIA ELISHAMA ELIADA AND ELIPHELET

WHEN THE PHILISTINES HEARD THAT DAVID HAD BEEN ANOINTED KING OVER ISRAEL ALL THE PHILISTINES WENT UP TO SEARCH FOR DAVID

BUT DAVID HEARD OF IT AND WENT DOWN TO THE STRONGHOLD

NOW THE PHILISTINES HAD COME AND SPREAD OUT IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

AND DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD SHALL I GO UP AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

WILL YOU GIVE THEM INTO MY HAND

 AND THE LORD SAID TO DAVID GO UP FOR I WILL CERTAINLY GIVE THE PHILISTINES INTO YOUR HAND

 AND DAVID CAME TO BAALPERAZIM AND DAVID DEFEATED THEM THERE

AND HE SAID THE LORD HAS BURST THROUGH MY ENEMIES BEFORE ME LIKE A BURSTING FLOOD

 THEREFORE THE NAME OF THAT PLACE IS CALLED BAALPERAZIM

AND THE PHILISTINES LEFT THEIR IDOLS THERE AND DAVID AND HIS MEN CARRIED THEM AWAY

AND THE PHILISTINES CAME UP YET AGAIN AND SPREAD OUT IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

AND WHEN DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD HE SAID YOU SHALL NOT GO UP; GO AROUND TO THEIR REAR AND COME AGAINST THEM OPPOSITE THE BALSAM TREES

AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF MARCHING IN THE TOPS OF THE BALSAM TREES THEN ROUSE YOURSELF FOR THEN THE LORD HAS GONE OUT BEFORE YOU TO STRIKE DOWN THE ARMY OF THE PHILISTINES

 AND DAVID DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED HIM AND STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINES FROM GEBA TO GEZER

DAVID AGAIN GATHERED ALL THE CHOSEN MEN OF ISRAEL THIRTY THOUSAND

AND DAVID AROSE AND WENT WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM FROM BAALEJUDAH TO BRING UP FROM THERE THE ARK OF GOD WHICH IS CALLED BY THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WHO SITS ENTHRONED ON THE CHERUBIM

AND THEY CARRIED THE ARK OF GOD ON A NEW CART AND BROUGHT IT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF ABINADAB WHICH WAS ON THE HILL

AND UZZAH AND AHIO THE SONS OF ABINADAB WERE DRIVING THE NEW CART WITH THE ARK OF GOD AND AHIO WENT BEFORE THE ARK

AND DAVID AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WERE MAKING MERRY BEFORE THE LORD WITH SONGS AND LYRES AND HARPS AND TAMBOURINES AND CASTANETS AND CYMBALS

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE THRESHING FLOOR OF NACON UZZAH PUT OUT HIS HAND TO THE ARK OF GOD AND TOOK HOLD OF IT FOR THE OXEN STUMBLED

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST UZZAH AND GOD STRUCK HIM DOWN THERE BECAUSE OF HIS ERROR AND HE DIED THERE BESIDE THE ARK OF GOD

AND DAVID WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THE LORD HAD BURST FORTH AGAINST UZZAH

AND THAT PLACE IS CALLED PEREZUZZAH TO THIS DAY

AND DAVID WAS AFRAID OF THE LORD THAT DAY AND HE SAID HOW CAN THE ARK OF THE LORD COME TO ME

 SO DAVID WAS NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE ARK OF THE LORD INTO THE CITY OF DAVID

BUT DAVID TOOK IT ASIDE TO THE HOUSE OF OBEDEDOM THE GITTITE

AND THE ARK OF THE LORD REMAINED IN THE HOUSE OF OBEDEDOM THE GITTITE THREE MONTHS AND THE LORD BLESSED OBEDEDOM AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD

AND IT WAS TOLD KING DAVID THE LORD HAS BLESSED THE HOUSEHOLD OF OBEDEDOM AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARK OF GOD

 SO DAVID WENT AND BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF GOD FROM THE HOUSE OF OBEDEDOM TO THE CITY OF DAVID WITH REJOICING

AND WHEN THOSE WHO BORE THE ARK OF THE LORD HAD GONE SIX STEPS HE SACRIFICED AN OX AND A FATTENED ANIMAL

AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT

AND DAVID WAS WEARING A LINEN EPHOD

SO DAVID AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF THE LORD WITH SHOUTING AND WITH THE SOUND OF THE HORN

AS THE ARK OF THE LORD CAME INTO THE CITY OF DAVID MICHAL THE DAUGHTER OF SAUL LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW KING DAVID LEAPING AND DANCING BEFORE THE LORD AND SHE DESPISED HIM IN HER HEART

AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE ARK OF THE LORD AND SET IT IN ITS PLACE INSIDE THE TENT THAT DAVID HAD PITCHED FOR IT

AND DAVID OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS BEFORE THE LORD

AND WHEN DAVID HAD FINISHED OFFERING THE BURNT OFFERINGS AND THE PEACE OFFERINGS HE BLESSED THE PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF ISRAEL BOTH MEN AND WOMEN A CAKE OF BREAD A PORTION OF MEAT AND A CAKE OF RAISINS TO EACH ONE

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE DEPARTED EACH TO HIS HOUSE

AND DAVID RETURNED TO BLESS HIS HOUSEHOLD

BUT MICHAL THE DAUGHTER OF SAUL CAME OUT TO MEET DAVID AND SAID HOW THE KING OF ISRAEL HONORED HIMSELF TODAY UNCOVERING HIMSELF TODAY BEFORE THE EYES OF HIS SERVANTS' FEMALE SERVANTS AS ONE OF THE VULGAR FELLOWS SHAMELESSLY UNCOVERS HIMSELF

 AND DAVID SAID TO MICHAL IT WAS BEFORE THE LORD WHO CHOSE ME ABOVE YOUR FATHER AND ABOVE ALL HIS HOUSE TO APPOINT ME AS PRINCE OVER ISRAEL THE PEOPLE OF THE LORDAND I WILL MAKE MERRY BEFORE THE LORD

I WILL MAKE MYSELF YET MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THIS AND I WILL BE ABASED IN YOUR EYES

BUT BY THE FEMALE SERVANTS OF WHOM YOU HAVE SPOKEN BY THEM I SHALL BE HELD IN HONOR

 AND MICHAL THE DAUGHTER OF SAUL HAD NO CHILD TO THE DAY OF HER DEATH

NOW WHEN THE KING LIVED IN HIS HOUSE AND THE LORD HAD GIVEN HIM REST FROM ALL HIS SURROUNDING ENEMIES THE KING SAID TO NATHAN THE PROPHET SEE NOW I DWELL IN A HOUSE OF CEDAR BUT THE ARK OF GOD DWELLS IN A TENT

 AND NATHAN SAID TO THE KING GO DO ALL THAT IS IN YOUR HEART FOR THE LORD IS WITH YOU

 BUT THAT SAME NIGHT THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO NATHAN GO AND TELL MY SERVANT DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD WOULD YOU BUILD ME A HOUSE TO DWELL IN

I HAVE NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE SINCE THE DAY I BROUGHT UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM EGYPT TO THIS DAY BUT I HAVE BEEN MOVING ABOUT IN A TENT FOR MY DWELLING

IN ALL PLACES WHERE I HAVE MOVED WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID I SPEAK A WORD WITH ANY OF THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL WHOM I COMMANDED TO SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL SAYING WHY HAVE YOU NOT BUILT ME A HOUSE OF CEDAR

' NOW THEREFORE THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO MY SERVANT DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS I TOOK YOU FROM THE PASTURE FROM FOLLOWING THE SHEEP THAT YOU SHOULD BE PRINCE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU WENT AND HAVE CUT OFF ALL YOUR ENEMIES FROM BEFORE YOU

AND I WILL MAKE FOR YOU A GREAT NAME LIKE THE NAME OF THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH

AND I WILL APPOINT A PLACE FOR MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND WILL PLANT THEM SO THAT THEY MAY DWELL IN THEIR OWN PLACE AND BE DISTURBED NO MORE

AND VIOLENT MEN SHALL AFFLICT THEM NO MORE AS FORMERLY FROM THE TIME THAT I APPOINTED JUDGES OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST FROM ALL YOUR ENEMIES

MOREOVER THE LORD DECLARES TO YOU THAT THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU A HOUSE

WHEN YOUR DAYS ARE FULFILLED AND YOU LIE DOWN WITH YOUR FATHERS I WILL RAISE UP YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU WHO SHALL COME FROM YOUR BODY AND I WILL ESTABLISH HIS KINGDOM

HE SHALL BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME AND I WILL ESTABLISH THE THRONE OF HIS KINGDOM FOREVER

I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON

WHEN HE COMMITS INIQUITY I WILL DISCIPLINE HIM WITH THE ROD OF MEN WITH THE STRIPES OF THE SONS OF MEN BUT MY STEADFAST LOVE WILL NOT DEPART FROM HIM AS I TOOK IT FROM SAUL WHOM I PUT AWAY FROM BEFORE YOU

AND YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR KINGDOM SHALL BE MADE SURE FOREVER BEFORE ME

YOUR THRONE SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER

' IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THESE WORDS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THIS VISION NATHAN SPOKE TO DAVID

THEN KING DAVID WENT IN AND SAT BEFORE THE LORD AND SAID WHO AM I O LORD GOD AND WHAT IS MY HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME THUS FAR

AND YET THIS WAS A SMALL THING IN YOUR EYES O LORD GOD

YOU HAVE SPOKEN ALSO OF YOUR SERVANT'S HOUSE FOR A GREAT WHILE TO COME AND THIS IS INSTRUCTION FOR MANKIND O LORD GOD

AND WHAT MORE CAN DAVID SAY TO YOU

FOR YOU KNOW YOUR SERVANT O LORD GOD

BECAUSE OF YOUR PROMISE AND ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN HEART YOU HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS GREATNESS TO MAKE YOUR SERVANT KNOW IT

THEREFORE YOU ARE GREAT O LORD GOD

FOR THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU AND THERE IS NO GOD BESIDES YOU ACCORDING TO ALL THAT WE HAVE HEARD WITH OUR EARS

AND WHO IS LIKE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL THE ONE NATION ON EARTH WHOM GOD WENT TO REDEEM TO BE HIS PEOPLE MAKING HIMSELF A NAME AND DOING FOR THEM GREAT AND AWESOME THINGS BY DRIVING OUT BEFORE YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU REDEEMED FOR YOURSELF FROM EGYPT A NATION AND ITS GODS

AND YOU ESTABLISHED FOR YOURSELF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL TO BE YOUR PEOPLE FOREVER

AND YOU O LORD BECAME THEIR GOD

AND NOW O LORD GOD CONFIRM FOREVER THE WORD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN CONCERNING YOUR SERVANT AND CONCERNING HIS HOUSE AND DO AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN

AND YOUR NAME WILL BE MAGNIFIED FOREVER SAYING 'THE LORD OF HOSTS IS GOD OVER ISRAEL' AND THE HOUSE OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID WILL BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE YOU

FOR YOU O LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAVE MADE THIS REVELATION TO YOUR SERVANT SAYING 'I WILL BUILD YOU A HOUSE

' THEREFORE YOUR SERVANT HAS FOUND COURAGE TO PRAY THIS PRAYER TO YOU

AND NOW O LORD GOD YOU ARE GOD AND YOUR WORDS ARE TRUE AND YOU HAVE PROMISED THIS GOOD THING TO YOUR SERVANT

NOW THEREFORE MAY IT PLEASE YOU TO BLESS THE HOUSE OF YOUR SERVANT SO THAT IT MAY CONTINUE FOREVER BEFORE YOU

FOR YOU O LORD GOD HAVE SPOKEN AND WITH YOUR BLESSING SHALL THE HOUSE OF YOUR SERVANT BE BLESSED FOREVER

AFTER THIS DAVID DEFEATED THE PHILISTINES AND SUBDUED THEM AND DAVID TOOK METHEGAMMAH OUT OF THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

AND HE DEFEATED MOAB AND HE MEASURED THEM WITH A LINE MAKING THEM LIE DOWN ON THE GROUND

TWO LINES HE MEASURED TO BE PUT TO DEATH AND ONE FULL LINE TO BE SPARED

AND THE MOABITES BECAME SERVANTS TO DAVID AND BROUGHT TRIBUTE

DAVID ALSO DEFEATED HADADEZER THE SON OF REHOB KING OF ZOBAH AS HE WENT TO RESTORE HIS POWER AT THE RIVER EUPHRATES

AND DAVID TOOK FROM HIM  HORSEMEN AND  FOOT SOLDIERS

AND DAVID HAMSTRUNG ALL THE CHARIOT HORSES BUT LEFT ENOUGH FOR A HUNDRED CHARIOTS

AND WHEN THE SYRIANS OF DAMASCUS CAME TO HELP HADADEZER KING OF ZOBAH DAVID STRUCK DOWN  MEN OF THE SYRIANS

THEN DAVID PUT GARRISONS IN ARAM OF DAMASCUS AND THE SYRIANS BECAME SERVANTS TO DAVID AND BROUGHT TRIBUTE

AND THE LORD GAVE VICTORY TO DAVID WHEREVER HE WENT

AND DAVID TOOK THE SHIELDS OF GOLD THAT WERE CARRIED BY THE SERVANTS OF HADADEZER AND BROUGHT THEM TO JERUSALEM

AND FROM BETAH AND FROM BEROTHAI CITIES OF HADADEZER KING DAVID TOOK VERY MUCH BRONZE

WHEN TOI KING OF HAMATH HEARD THAT DAVID HAD DEFEATED THE WHOLE ARMY OF HADADEZER TOI SENT HIS SON JORAM TO KING DAVID TO ASK ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND TO BLESS HIM BECAUSE HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST HADADEZER AND DEFEATED HIM FOR HADADEZER HAD OFTEN BEEN AT WAR WITH TOI

AND JORAM BROUGHT WITH HIM ARTICLES OF SILVER OF GOLD AND OF BRONZE

THESE ALSO KING DAVID DEDICATED TO THE LORD TOGETHER WITH THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT HE DEDICATED FROM ALL THE NATIONS HE SUBDUED FROM EDOM MOAB THE AMMONITES THE PHILISTINES AMALEK AND FROM THE SPOIL OF HADADEZER THE SON OF REHOB KING OF ZOBAH

AND DAVID MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE RETURNED FROM STRIKING DOWN  EDOMITES IN THE VALLEY OF SALT

THEN HE PUT GARRISONS IN EDOM; THROUGHOUT ALL EDOM HE PUT GARRISONS AND ALL THE EDOMITES BECAME DAVID'S SERVANTS

AND THE LORD GAVE VICTORY TO DAVID WHEREVER HE WENT

SO DAVID REIGNED OVER ALL ISRAEL

AND DAVID ADMINISTERED JUSTICE AND EQUITY TO ALL HIS PEOPLE

JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH WAS OVER THE ARMY AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF AHILUD WAS RECORDER AND ZADOK THE SON OF AHITUB AND AHIMELECH THE SON OF ABIATHAR WERE PRIESTS AND SERAIAH WAS SECRETARY AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS OVER THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES AND DAVID'S SONS WERE PRIESTS

AND DAVID SAID IS THERE STILL ANYONE LEFT OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL THAT I MAY SHOW HIM KINDNESS FOR JONATHAN'S SAKE

 NOW THERE WAS A SERVANT OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL WHOSE NAME WAS ZIBA AND THEY CALLED HIM TO DAVID

AND THE KING SAID TO HIM ARE YOU ZIBA

 AND HE SAID I AM YOUR SERVANT

 AND THE KING SAID IS THERE NOT STILL SOMEONE OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL THAT I MAY SHOW THE KINDNESS OF GOD TO HIM

 ZIBA SAID TO THE KING THERE IS STILL A SON OF JONATHAN; HE IS CRIPPLED IN HIS FEET

 THE KING SAID TO HIM WHERE IS HE

 AND ZIBA SAID TO THE KING HE IS IN THE HOUSE OF MACHIR THE SON OF AMMIEL AT LODEBAR

 THEN KING DAVID SENT AND BROUGHT HIM FROM THE HOUSE OF MACHIR THE SON OF AMMIEL AT LODEBAR

AND MEPHIBOSHETH THE SON OF JONATHAN SON OF SAUL CAME TO DAVID AND FELL ON HIS FACE AND PAID HOMAGE

AND DAVID SAID MEPHIBOSHETH

 AND HE ANSWERED BEHOLD I AM YOUR SERVANT

 AND DAVID SAID TO HIM DO NOT FEAR FOR I WILL SHOW YOU KINDNESS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FATHER JONATHAN AND I WILL RESTORE TO YOU ALL THE LAND OF SAUL YOUR FATHER AND YOU SHALL EAT AT MY TABLE ALWAYS

 AND HE PAID HOMAGE AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR SERVANT THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW REGARD FOR A DEAD DOG SUCH AS I

 THEN THE KING CALLED ZIBA SAUL'S SERVANT AND SAID TO HIM ALL THAT BELONGED TO SAUL AND TO ALL HIS HOUSE I HAVE GIVEN TO YOUR MASTER'S GRANDSON

AND YOU AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR SERVANTS SHALL TILL THE LAND FOR HIM AND SHALL BRING IN THE PRODUCE THAT YOUR MASTER'S GRANDSON MAY HAVE BREAD TO EAT

BUT MEPHIBOSHETH YOUR MASTER'S GRANDSON SHALL ALWAYS EAT AT MY TABLE

 NOW ZIBA HAD FIFTEEN SONS AND TWENTY SERVANTS

THEN ZIBA SAID TO THE KING ACCORDING TO ALL THAT MY LORD THE KING COMMANDS HIS SERVANT SO WILL YOUR SERVANT DO

 SO MEPHIBOSHETH ATE AT DAVID'S TABLE LIKE ONE OF THE KING'S SONS

AND MEPHIBOSHETH HAD A YOUNG SON WHOSE NAME WAS MICA

AND ALL WHO LIVED IN ZIBA'S HOUSE BECAME MEPHIBOSHETH'S SERVANTS

SO MEPHIBOSHETH LIVED IN JERUSALEM FOR HE ATE ALWAYS AT THE KING'S TABLE

NOW HE WAS LAME IN BOTH HIS FEET

AFTER THIS THE KING OF THE AMMONITES DIED AND HANUN HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AND DAVID SAID I WILL DEAL LOYALLY WITH HANUN THE SON OF NAHASH AS HIS FATHER DEALT LOYALLY WITH ME

 SO DAVID SENT BY HIS SERVANTS TO CONSOLE HIM CONCERNING HIS FATHER

AND DAVID'S SERVANTS CAME INTO THE LAND OF THE AMMONITES

BUT THE PRINCES OF THE AMMONITES SAID TO HANUN THEIR LORD DO YOU THINK BECAUSE DAVID HAS SENT COMFORTERS TO YOU THAT HE IS HONORING YOUR FATHER

HAS NOT DAVID SENT HIS SERVANTS TO YOU TO SEARCH THE CITY AND TO SPY IT OUT AND TO OVERTHROW IT

 SO HANUN TOOK DAVID'S SERVANTS AND SHAVED OFF HALF THE BEARD OF EACH AND CUT OFF THEIR GARMENTS IN THE MIDDLE AT THEIR HIPS AND SENT THEM AWAY

WHEN IT WAS TOLD DAVID HE SENT TO MEET THEM FOR THE MEN WERE GREATLY ASHAMED

AND THE KING SAID REMAIN AT JERICHO UNTIL YOUR BEARDS HAVE GROWN AND THEN RETURN

 WHEN THE AMMONITES SAW THAT THEY HAD BECOME A STENCH TO DAVID THE AMMONITES SENT AND HIRED THE SYRIANS OF BETHREHOB AND THE SYRIANS OF ZOBAH  FOOT SOLDIERS AND THE KING OF MAACAH WITH  MEN AND THE MEN OF TOB  MEN

AND WHEN DAVID HEARD OF IT HE SENT JOAB AND ALL THE HOST OF THE MIGHTY MEN

AND THE AMMONITES CAME OUT AND DREW UP IN BATTLE ARRAY AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE AND THE SYRIANS OF ZOBAH AND OF REHOB AND THE MEN OF TOB AND MAACAH WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY

WHEN JOAB SAW THAT THE BATTLE WAS SET AGAINST HIM BOTH IN FRONT AND IN THE REAR HE CHOSE SOME OF THE BEST MEN OF ISRAEL AND ARRAYED THEM AGAINST THE SYRIANS

THE REST OF HIS MEN HE PUT IN THE CHARGE OF ABISHAI HIS BROTHER AND HE ARRAYED THEM AGAINST THE AMMONITES

AND HE SAID IF THE SYRIANS ARE TOO STRONG FOR ME THEN YOU SHALL HELP ME BUT IF THE AMMONITES ARE TOO STRONG FOR YOU THEN I WILL COME AND HELP YOU

BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND LET US BE COURAGEOUS FOR OUR PEOPLE AND FOR THE CITIES OF OUR GOD AND MAY THE LORD DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

 SO JOAB AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR TO BATTLE AGAINST THE SYRIANS AND THEY FLED BEFORE HIM

AND WHEN THE AMMONITES SAW THAT THE SYRIANS FLED THEY LIKEWISE FLED BEFORE ABISHAI AND ENTERED THE CITY

THEN JOAB RETURNED FROM FIGHTING AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND CAME TO JERUSALEM

BUT WHEN THE SYRIANS SAW THAT THEY HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY ISRAEL THEY GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER

AND HADADEZER SENT AND BROUGHT OUT THE SYRIANS WHO WERE BEYOND THE EUPHRATES

THEY CAME TO HELAM WITH SHOBACH THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF HADADEZER AT THEIR HEAD

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD DAVID HE GATHERED ALL ISRAEL TOGETHER AND CROSSED THE JORDAN AND CAME TO HELAM

THE SYRIANS ARRAYED THEMSELVES AGAINST DAVID AND FOUGHT WITH HIM

AND THE SYRIANS FLED BEFORE ISRAEL AND DAVID KILLED OF THE SYRIANS THE MEN OF  CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN AND WOUNDED SHOBACH THE COMMANDER OF THEIR ARMY SO THAT HE DIED THERE

AND WHEN ALL THE KINGS WHO WERE SERVANTS OF HADADEZER SAW THAT THEY HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY ISRAEL THEY MADE PEACE WITH ISRAEL AND BECAME SUBJECT TO THEM

SO THE SYRIANS WERE AFRAID TO SAVE THE AMMONITES ANYMORE

IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR THE TIME WHEN KINGS GO OUT TO BATTLE DAVID SENT JOAB AND HIS SERVANTS WITH HIM AND ALL ISRAEL

AND THEY RAVAGED THE AMMONITES AND BESIEGED RABBAH

BUT DAVID REMAINED AT JERUSALEM

IT HAPPENED LATE ONE AFTERNOON WHEN DAVID AROSE FROM HIS COUCH AND WAS WALKING ON THE ROOF OF THE KING'S HOUSE THAT HE SAW FROM THE ROOF A WOMAN BATHING; AND THE WOMAN WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL

AND DAVID SENT AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE WOMAN

AND ONE SAID IS NOT THIS BATHSHEBA THE DAUGHTER OF ELIAM THE WIFE OF URIAH THE HITTITE

 SO DAVID SENT MESSENGERS AND TOOK HER AND SHE CAME TO HIM AND HE LAY WITH HER

NOW SHE HAD BEEN PURIFYING HERSELF FROM HER UNCLEANNESS

 THEN SHE RETURNED TO HER HOUSE

AND THE WOMAN CONCEIVED AND SHE SENT AND TOLD DAVID I AM PREGNANT

 SO DAVID SENT WORD TO JOAB SEND ME URIAH THE HITTITE

 AND JOAB SENT URIAH TO DAVID

WHEN URIAH CAME TO HIM DAVID ASKED HOW JOAB WAS DOING AND HOW THE PEOPLE WERE DOING AND HOW THE WAR WAS GOING

THEN DAVID SAID TO URIAH GO DOWN TO YOUR HOUSE AND WASH YOUR FEET

 AND URIAH WENT OUT OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND THERE FOLLOWED HIM A PRESENT FROM THE KING

BUT URIAH SLEPT AT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S HOUSE WITH ALL THE SERVANTS OF HIS LORD AND DID NOT GO DOWN TO HIS HOUSE

WHEN THEY TOLD DAVID URIAH DID NOT GO DOWN TO HIS HOUSE DAVID SAID TO URIAH HAVE YOU NOT COME FROM A JOURNEY

WHY DID YOU NOT GO DOWN TO YOUR HOUSE

 URIAH SAID TO DAVID THE ARK AND ISRAEL AND JUDAH DWELL IN BOOTHS AND MY LORD JOAB AND THE SERVANTS OF MY LORD ARE CAMPING IN THE OPEN FIELD

SHALL I THEN GO TO MY HOUSE TO EAT AND TO DRINK AND TO LIE WITH MY WIFE

AS YOU LIVE AND AS YOUR SOUL LIVES I WILL NOT DO THIS THING

 THEN DAVID SAID TO URIAH REMAIN HERE TODAY ALSO AND TOMORROW I WILL SEND YOU BACK

 SO URIAH REMAINED IN JERUSALEM THAT DAY AND THE NEXT

AND DAVID INVITED HIM AND HE ATE IN HIS PRESENCE AND DRANK SO THAT HE MADE HIM DRUNK

AND IN THE EVENING HE WENT OUT TO LIE ON HIS COUCH WITH THE SERVANTS OF HIS LORD BUT HE DID NOT GO DOWN TO HIS HOUSE

IN THE MORNING DAVID WROTE A LETTER TO JOAB AND SENT IT BY THE HAND OF URIAH

IN THE LETTER HE WROTE SET URIAH IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE HARDEST FIGHTING AND THEN DRAW BACK FROM HIM THAT HE MAY BE STRUCK DOWN AND DIE

 AND AS JOAB WAS BESIEGING THE CITY HE ASSIGNED URIAH TO THE PLACE WHERE HE KNEW THERE WERE VALIANT MEN

AND THE MEN OF THE CITY CAME OUT AND FOUGHT WITH JOAB AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS OF DAVID AMONG THE PEOPLE FELL

URIAH THE HITTITE ALSO DIED

THEN JOAB SENT AND TOLD DAVID ALL THE NEWS ABOUT THE FIGHTING

AND HE INSTRUCTED THE MESSENGER WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED TELLING ALL THE NEWS ABOUT THE FIGHTING TO THE KING THEN IF THE KING'S ANGER RISES AND IF HE SAYS TO YOU 'WHY DID YOU GO SO NEAR THE CITY TO FIGHT

DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT THEY WOULD SHOOT FROM THE WALL

WHO KILLED ABIMELECH THE SON OF JERUBBESHETH

DID NOT A WOMAN CAST AN UPPER MILLSTONE ON HIM FROM THE WALL SO THAT HE DIED AT THEBEZ

WHY DID YOU GO SO NEAR THE WALL

' THEN YOU SHALL SAY 'YOUR SERVANT URIAH THE HITTITE IS DEAD ALSO

' SO THE MESSENGER WENT AND CAME AND TOLD DAVID ALL THAT JOAB HAD SENT HIM TO TELL

THE MESSENGER SAID TO DAVID THE MEN GAINED AN ADVANTAGE OVER US AND CAME OUT AGAINST US IN THE FIELD BUT WE DROVE THEM BACK TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE

THEN THE ARCHERS SHOT AT YOUR SERVANTS FROM THE WALL

SOME OF THE KING'S SERVANTS ARE DEAD AND YOUR SERVANT URIAH THE HITTITE IS DEAD ALSO

 DAVID SAID TO THE MESSENGER THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO JOAB 'DO NOT LET THIS MATTER TROUBLE YOU FOR THE SWORD DEVOURS NOW ONE AND NOW ANOTHER

STRENGTHEN YOUR ATTACK AGAINST THE CITY AND OVERTHROW IT

' AND ENCOURAGE HIM

 WHEN THE WIFE OF URIAH HEARD THAT URIAH HER HUSBAND WAS DEAD SHE LAMENTED OVER HER HUSBAND

AND WHEN THE MOURNING WAS OVER DAVID SENT AND BROUGHT HER TO HIS HOUSE AND SHE BECAME HIS WIFE AND BORE HIM A SON

BUT THE THING THAT DAVID HAD DONE DISPLEASED THE LORD

AND THE LORD SENT NATHAN TO DAVID

HE CAME TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM THERE WERE TWO MEN IN A CERTAIN CITY THE ONE RICH AND THE OTHER POOR

THE RICH MAN HAD VERY MANY FLOCKS AND HERDS BUT THE POOR MAN HAD NOTHING BUT ONE LITTLE EWE LAMB WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT

AND HE BROUGHT IT UP AND IT GREW UP WITH HIM AND WITH HIS CHILDREN

IT USED TO EAT OF HIS MORSEL AND DRINK FROM HIS CUP AND LIE IN HIS ARMS AND IT WAS LIKE A DAUGHTER TO HIM

NOW THERE CAME A TRAVELER TO THE RICH MAN AND HE WAS UNWILLING TO TAKE ONE OF HIS OWN FLOCK OR HERD TO PREPARE FOR THE GUEST WHO HAD COME TO HIM BUT HE TOOK THE POOR MAN'S LAMB AND PREPARED IT FOR THE MAN WHO HAD COME TO HIM

 THEN DAVID'S ANGER WAS GREATLY KINDLED AGAINST THE MAN AND HE SAID TO NATHAN AS THE LORD LIVES THE MAN WHO HAS DONE THIS DESERVES TO DIE AND HE SHALL RESTORE THE LAMB FOURFOLD BECAUSE HE DID THIS THING AND BECAUSE HE HAD NO PITY

 NATHAN SAID TO DAVID YOU ARE THE MAN

THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'I ANOINTED YOU KING OVER ISRAEL AND I DELIVERED YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF SAUL

AND I GAVE YOU YOUR MASTER'S HOUSE AND YOUR MASTER'S WIVES INTO YOUR ARMS AND GAVE YOU THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND OF JUDAH

AND IF THIS WERE TOO LITTLE I WOULD ADD TO YOU AS MUCH MORE

WHY HAVE YOU DESPISED THE WORD OF THE LORD TO DO WHAT IS EVIL IN HIS SIGHT

YOU HAVE STRUCK DOWN URIAH THE HITTITE WITH THE SWORD AND HAVE TAKEN HIS WIFE TO BE YOUR WIFE AND HAVE KILLED HIM WITH THE SWORD OF THE AMMONITES

NOW THEREFORE THE SWORD SHALL NEVER DEPART FROM YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE DESPISED ME AND HAVE TAKEN THE WIFE OF URIAH THE HITTITE TO BE YOUR WIFE

' THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BEHOLD I WILL RAISE UP EVIL AGAINST YOU OUT OF YOUR OWN HOUSE

AND I WILL TAKE YOUR WIVES BEFORE YOUR EYES AND GIVE THEM TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND HE SHALL LIE WITH YOUR WIVES IN THE SIGHT OF THIS SUN

FOR YOU DID IT SECRETLY BUT I WILL DO THIS THING BEFORE ALL ISRAEL AND BEFORE THE SUN

' DAVID SAID TO NATHAN I HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD

 AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID THE LORD ALSO HAS PUT AWAY YOUR SIN; YOU SHALL NOT DIE

NEVERTHELESS BECAUSE BY THIS DEED YOU HAVE UTTERLY SCORNED THE LORD THE CHILD WHO IS BORN TO YOU SHALL DIE THEN NATHAN WENT TO HIS HOUSE

AND THE LORD AFFLICTED THE CHILD THAT URIAH'S WIFE BORE TO DAVID AND HE BECAME SICK

DAVID THEREFORE SOUGHT GOD ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD

AND DAVID FASTED AND WENT IN AND LAY ALL NIGHT ON THE GROUND

AND THE ELDERS OF HIS HOUSE STOOD BESIDE HIM TO RAISE HIM FROM THE GROUND BUT HE WOULD NOT NOR DID HE EAT FOOD WITH THEM

ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE CHILD DIED

AND THE SERVANTS OF DAVID WERE AFRAID TO TELL HIM THAT THE CHILD WAS DEAD FOR THEY SAID BEHOLD WHILE THE CHILD WAS YET ALIVE WE SPOKE TO HIM AND HE DID NOT LISTEN TO US

HOW THEN CAN WE SAY TO HIM THE CHILD IS DEAD

HE MAY DO HIMSELF SOME HARM

 BUT WHEN DAVID SAW THAT HIS SERVANTS WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER DAVID UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHILD WAS DEAD

AND DAVID SAID TO HIS SERVANTS IS THE CHILD DEAD

 THEY SAID HE IS DEAD

 THEN DAVID AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND WASHED AND ANOINTED HIMSELF AND CHANGED HIS CLOTHES

AND HE WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND WORSHIPED

HE THEN WENT TO HIS OWN HOUSE

AND WHEN HE ASKED THEY SET FOOD BEFORE HIM AND HE ATE

THEN HIS SERVANTS SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE DONE

YOU FASTED AND WEPT FOR THE CHILD WHILE HE WAS ALIVE; BUT WHEN THE CHILD DIED YOU AROSE AND ATE FOOD

 HE SAID WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL ALIVE I FASTED AND WEPT FOR I SAID 'WHO KNOWS WHETHER THE LORD WILL BE GRACIOUS TO ME THAT THE CHILD MAY LIVE

' BUT NOW HE IS DEAD

WHY SHOULD I FAST

CAN I BRING HIM BACK AGAIN

I SHALL GO TO HIM BUT HE WILL NOT RETURN TO ME

 THEN DAVID COMFORTED HIS WIFE BATHSHEBA AND WENT IN TO HER AND LAY WITH HER AND SHE BORE A SON AND HE CALLED HIS NAME SOLOMON

AND THE LORD LOVED HIM AND SENT A MESSAGE BY NATHAN THE PROPHET

SO HE CALLED HIS NAME JEDIDIAH BECAUSE OF THE LORD

NOW JOAB FOUGHT AGAINST RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES AND TOOK THE ROYAL CITY

AND JOAB SENT MESSENGERS TO DAVID AND SAID I HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST RABBAH; MOREOVER I HAVE TAKEN THE CITY OF WATERS

NOW THEN GATHER THE REST OF THE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND ENCAMP AGAINST THE CITY AND TAKE IT LEST I TAKE THE CITY AND IT BE CALLED BY MY NAME

 SO DAVID GATHERED ALL THE PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WENT TO RABBAH AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT AND TOOK IT

AND HE TOOK THE CROWN OF THEIR KING FROM HIS HEAD

THE WEIGHT OF IT WAS A TALENT OF GOLD AND IN IT WAS A PRECIOUS STONE AND IT WAS PLACED ON DAVID'S HEAD

AND HE BROUGHT OUT THE SPOIL OF THE CITY A VERY GREAT AMOUNT

AND HE BROUGHT OUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT AND SET THEM TO LABOR WITH SAWS AND IRON PICKS AND IRON AXES AND MADE THEM TOIL AT THE BRICK KILNS

AND THUS HE DID TO ALL THE CITIES OF THE AMMONITES

THEN DAVID AND ALL THE PEOPLE RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

NOW ABSALOM DAVID'S SON HAD A BEAUTIFUL SISTER WHOSE NAME WAS TAMAR

AND AFTER A TIME AMNON DAVID'S SON LOVED HER

AND AMNON WAS SO TORMENTED THAT HE MADE HIMSELF ILL BECAUSE OF HIS SISTER TAMAR FOR SHE WAS A VIRGIN AND IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO AMNON TO DO ANYTHING TO HER

BUT AMNON HAD A FRIEND WHOSE NAME WAS JONADAB THE SON OF SHIMEAH DAVID'S BROTHER

AND JONADAB WAS A VERY CRAFTY MAN

AND HE SAID TO HIM O SON OF THE KING WHY ARE YOU SO HAGGARD MORNING AFTER MORNING

WILL YOU NOT TELL ME

 AMNON SAID TO HIM I LOVE TAMAR MY BROTHER ABSALOM'S SISTER

 JONADAB SAID TO HIM LIE DOWN ON YOUR BED AND PRETEND TO BE ILL

AND WHEN YOUR FATHER COMES TO SEE YOU SAY TO HIM 'LET MY SISTER TAMAR COME AND GIVE ME BREAD TO EAT AND PREPARE THE FOOD IN MY SIGHT THAT I MAY SEE IT AND EAT IT FROM HER HAND

' SO AMNON LAY DOWN AND PRETENDED TO BE ILL

AND WHEN THE KING CAME TO SEE HIM AMNON SAID TO THE KING PLEASE LET MY SISTER TAMAR COME AND MAKE A COUPLE OF CAKES IN MY SIGHT THAT I MAY EAT FROM HER HAND

 THEN DAVID SENT HOME TO TAMAR SAYING GO TO YOUR BROTHER AMNON'S HOUSE AND PREPARE FOOD FOR HIM

 SO TAMAR WENT TO HER BROTHER AMNON'S HOUSE WHERE HE WAS LYING DOWN

AND SHE TOOK DOUGH AND KNEADED IT AND MADE CAKES IN HIS SIGHT AND BAKED THE CAKES

AND SHE TOOK THE PAN AND EMPTIED IT OUT BEFORE HIM BUT HE REFUSED TO EAT

AND AMNON SAID SEND OUT EVERYONE FROM ME

 SO EVERYONE WENT OUT FROM HIM

THEN AMNON SAID TO TAMAR BRING THE FOOD INTO THE CHAMBER THAT I MAY EAT FROM YOUR HAND

 AND TAMAR TOOK THE CAKES SHE HAD MADE AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHAMBER TO AMNON HER BROTHER

BUT WHEN SHE BROUGHT THEM NEAR HIM TO EAT HE TOOK HOLD OF HER AND SAID TO HER COME LIE WITH ME MY SISTER

 SHE ANSWERED HIM NO MY BROTHER DO NOT VIOLATE ME FOR SUCH A THING IS NOT DONE IN ISRAEL; DO NOT DO THIS OUTRAGEOUS THING

AS FOR ME WHERE COULD I CARRY MY SHAME

AND AS FOR YOU YOU WOULD BE AS ONE OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FOOLS IN ISRAEL

NOW THEREFORE PLEASE SPEAK TO THE KING FOR HE WILL NOT WITHHOLD ME FROM YOU

 BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER AND BEING STRONGER THAN SHE HE VIOLATED HER AND LAY WITH HER

THEN AMNON HATED HER WITH VERY GREAT HATRED SO THAT THE HATRED WITH WHICH HE HATED HER WAS GREATER THAN THE LOVE WITH WHICH HE HAD LOVED HER

AND AMNON SAID TO HER GET UP

GO

 BUT SHE SAID TO HIM NO MY BROTHER FOR THIS WRONG IN SENDING ME AWAY IS GREATER THAN THE OTHER THAT YOU DID TO ME

 BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER

HE CALLED THE YOUNG MAN WHO SERVED HIM AND SAID PUT THIS WOMAN OUT OF MY PRESENCE AND BOLT THE DOOR AFTER HER

 NOW SHE WAS WEARING A LONG ROBE WITH SLEEVES FOR THUS WERE THE VIRGIN DAUGHTERS OF THE KING DRESSED

SO HIS SERVANT PUT HER OUT AND BOLTED THE DOOR AFTER HER

AND TAMAR PUT ASHES ON HER HEAD AND TORE THE LONG ROBE THAT SHE WORE

AND SHE LAID HER HAND ON HER HEAD AND WENT AWAY CRYING ALOUD AS SHE WENT

AND HER BROTHER ABSALOM SAID TO HER HAS AMNON YOUR BROTHER BEEN WITH YOU

NOW HOLD YOUR PEACE MY SISTER

HE IS YOUR BROTHER; DO NOT TAKE THIS TO HEART

 SO TAMAR LIVED A DESOLATE WOMAN IN HER BROTHER ABSALOM'S HOUSE

WHEN KING DAVID HEARD OF ALL THESE THINGS HE WAS VERY ANGRY

BUT ABSALOM SPOKE TO AMNON NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD FOR ABSALOM HATED AMNON BECAUSE HE HAD VIOLATED HIS SISTER TAMAR

AFTER TWO FULL YEARS ABSALOM HAD SHEEPSHEARERS AT BAALHAZOR WHICH IS NEAR EPHRAIM AND ABSALOM INVITED ALL THE KING'S SONS

AND ABSALOM CAME TO THE KING AND SAID BEHOLD YOUR SERVANT HAS SHEEPSHEARERS

PLEASE LET THE KING AND HIS SERVANTS GO WITH YOUR SERVANT

 BUT THE KING SAID TO ABSALOM NO MY SON LET US NOT ALL GO LEST WE BE BURDENSOME TO YOU

 HE PRESSED HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT GAVE HIM HIS BLESSING

THEN ABSALOM SAID IF NOT PLEASE LET MY BROTHER AMNON GO WITH US

 AND THE KING SAID TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE GO WITH YOU

 BUT ABSALOM PRESSED HIM UNTIL HE LET AMNON AND ALL THE KING'S SONS GO WITH HIM

THEN ABSALOM COMMANDED HIS SERVANTS MARK WHEN AMNON'S HEART IS MERRY WITH WINE AND WHEN I SAY TO YOU 'STRIKE AMNON' THEN KILL HIM

DO NOT FEAR; HAVE I NOT COMMANDED YOU

BE COURAGEOUS AND BE VALIANT

 SO THE SERVANTS OF ABSALOM DID TO AMNON AS ABSALOM HAD COMMANDED

THEN ALL THE KING'S SONS AROSE AND EACH MOUNTED HIS MULE AND FLED

WHILE THEY WERE ON THE WAY NEWS CAME TO DAVID ABSALOM HAS STRUCK DOWN ALL THE KING'S SONS AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS LEFT

 THEN THE KING AROSE AND TORE HIS GARMENTS AND LAY ON THE EARTH

AND ALL HIS SERVANTS WHO WERE STANDING BY TORE THEIR GARMENTS

BUT JONADAB THE SON OF SHIMEAH DAVID'S BROTHER SAID LET NOT MY LORD SUPPOSE THAT THEY HAVE KILLED ALL THE YOUNG MEN THE KING'S SONS FOR AMNON ALONE IS DEAD

FOR BY THE COMMAND OF ABSALOM THIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED FROM THE DAY HE VIOLATED HIS SISTER TAMAR

NOW THEREFORE LET NOT MY LORD THE KING SO TAKE IT TO HEART AS TO SUPPOSE THAT ALL THE KING'S SONS ARE DEAD FOR AMNON ALONE IS DEAD

 BUT ABSALOM FLED

AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO KEPT THE WATCH LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD MANY PEOPLE WERE COMING FROM THE ROAD BEHIND HIM BY THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

AND JONADAB SAID TO THE KING BEHOLD THE KING'S SONS HAVE COME; AS YOUR SERVANT SAID SO IT HAS COME ABOUT

 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING BEHOLD THE KING'S SONS CAME AND LIFTED UP THEIR VOICE AND WEPT

AND THE KING ALSO AND ALL HIS SERVANTS WEPT VERY BITTERLY

BUT ABSALOM FLED AND WENT TO TALMAI THE SON OF AMMIHUD KING OF GESHUR

AND DAVID MOURNED FOR HIS SON DAY AFTER DAY

SO ABSALOM FLED AND WENT TO GESHUR AND WAS THERE THREE YEARS

AND THE SPIRIT OF THE KING LONGED TO GO OUT TO ABSALOM BECAUSE HE WAS COMFORTED ABOUT AMNON SINCE HE WAS DEAD

NOW JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH KNEW THAT THE KING'S HEART WENT OUT TO ABSALOM

AND JOAB SENT TO TEKOA AND BROUGHT FROM THERE A WISE WOMAN AND SAID TO HER PRETEND TO BE A MOURNER AND PUT ON MOURNING GARMENTS

DO NOT ANOINT YOURSELF WITH OIL BUT BEHAVE LIKE A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN MOURNING MANY DAYS FOR THE DEAD

GO TO THE KING AND SPEAK THUS TO HIM

 SO JOAB PUT THE WORDS IN HER MOUTH

WHEN THE WOMAN OF TEKOA CAME TO THE KING SHE FELL ON HER FACE TO THE GROUND AND PAID HOMAGE AND SAID SAVE ME O KING

 AND THE KING SAID TO HER WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE

 SHE ANSWERED ALAS I AM A WIDOW; MY HUSBAND IS DEAD

AND YOUR SERVANT HAD TWO SONS AND THEY QUARRELED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE FIELD

THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEPARATE THEM AND ONE STRUCK THE OTHER AND KILLED HIM

AND NOW THE WHOLE CLAN HAS RISEN AGAINST YOUR SERVANT AND THEY SAY 'GIVE UP THE MAN WHO STRUCK HIS BROTHER THAT WE MAY PUT HIM TO DEATH FOR THE LIFE OF HIS BROTHER WHOM HE KILLED

' AND SO THEY WOULD DESTROY THE HEIR ALSO

THUS THEY WOULD QUENCH MY COAL THAT IS LEFT AND LEAVE TO MY HUSBAND NEITHER NAME NOR REMNANT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

 THEN THE KING SAID TO THE WOMAN GO TO YOUR HOUSE AND I WILL GIVE ORDERS CONCERNING YOU

 AND THE WOMAN OF TEKOA SAID TO THE KING ON ME BE THE GUILT MY LORD THE KING AND ON MY FATHER'S HOUSE; LET THE KING AND HIS THRONE BE GUILTLESS

 THE KING SAID IF ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING TO YOU BRING HIM TO ME AND HE SHALL NEVER TOUCH YOU AGAIN

 THEN SHE SAID PLEASE LET THE KING INVOKE THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT THE AVENGER OF BLOOD KILL NO MORE AND MY SON BE NOT DESTROYED

 HE SAID AS THE LORD LIVES NOT ONE HAIR OF YOUR SON SHALL FALL TO THE GROUND

 THEN THE WOMAN SAID PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK A WORD TO MY LORD THE KING

 HE SAID SPEAK

 AND THE WOMAN SAID WHY THEN HAVE YOU PLANNED SUCH A THING AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF GOD

FOR IN GIVING THIS DECISION THE KING CONVICTS HIMSELF INASMUCH AS THE KING DOES NOT BRING HIS BANISHED ONE HOME AGAIN

WE MUST ALL DIE; WE ARE LIKE WATER SPILLED ON THE GROUND WHICH CANNOT BE GATHERED UP AGAIN

BUT GOD WILL NOT TAKE AWAY LIFE AND HE DEVISES MEANS SO THAT THE BANISHED ONE WILL NOT REMAIN AN OUTCAST

NOW I HAVE COME TO SAY THIS TO MY LORD THE KING BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE ME AFRAID AND YOUR SERVANT THOUGHT 'I WILL SPEAK TO THE KING; IT MAY BE THAT THE KING WILL PERFORM THE REQUEST OF HIS SERVANT

FOR THE KING WILL HEAR AND DELIVER HIS SERVANT FROM THE HAND OF THE MAN WHO WOULD DESTROY ME AND MY SON TOGETHER FROM THE HERITAGE OF GOD

' AND YOUR SERVANT THOUGHT 'THE WORD OF MY LORD THE KING WILL SET ME AT REST' FOR MY LORD THE KING IS LIKE THE ANGEL OF GOD TO DISCERN GOOD AND EVIL

THE LORD YOUR GOD BE WITH YOU

 THEN THE KING ANSWERED THE WOMAN DO NOT HIDE FROM ME ANYTHING I ASK YOU

 AND THE WOMAN SAID LET MY LORD THE KING SPEAK

 THE KING SAID IS THE HAND OF JOAB WITH YOU IN ALL THIS

 THE WOMAN ANSWERED AND SAID AS SURELY AS YOU LIVE MY LORD THE KING ONE CANNOT TURN TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT FROM ANYTHING THAT MY LORD THE KING HAS SAID

IT WAS YOUR SERVANT JOAB WHO COMMANDED ME; IT WAS HE WHO PUT ALL THESE WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF YOUR SERVANT

IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THINGS YOUR SERVANT JOAB DID THIS

BUT MY LORD HAS WISDOM LIKE THE WISDOM OF THE ANGEL OF GOD TO KNOW ALL THINGS THAT ARE ON THE EARTH

 THEN THE KING SAID TO JOAB BEHOLD NOW I GRANT THIS; GO BRING BACK THE YOUNG MAN ABSALOM

 AND JOAB FELL ON HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND PAID HOMAGE AND BLESSED THE KING

AND JOAB SAID TODAY YOUR SERVANT KNOWS THAT I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT MY LORD THE KING IN THAT THE KING HAS GRANTED THE REQUEST OF HIS SERVANT

 SO JOAB AROSE AND WENT TO GESHUR AND BROUGHT ABSALOM TO JERUSALEM

AND THE KING SAID LET HIM DWELL APART IN HIS OWN HOUSE; HE IS NOT TO COME INTO MY PRESENCE

 SO ABSALOM LIVED APART IN HIS OWN HOUSE AND DID NOT COME INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE

NOW IN ALL ISRAEL THERE WAS NO ONE SO MUCH TO BE PRAISED FOR HIS HANDSOME APPEARANCE AS ABSALOM

FROM THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD THERE WAS NO BLEMISH IN HIM

AND WHEN HE CUT THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD FOR AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR HE USED TO CUT IT; WHEN IT WAS HEAVY ON HIM HE CUT IT HE WEIGHED THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD TWO HUNDRED SHEKELS BY THE KING'S WEIGHT

THERE WERE BORN TO ABSALOM THREE SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER WHOSE NAME WAS TAMAR

SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

SO ABSALOM LIVED TWO FULL YEARS IN JERUSALEM WITHOUT COMING INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE

THEN ABSALOM SENT FOR JOAB TO SEND HIM TO THE KING BUT JOAB WOULD NOT COME TO HIM

AND HE SENT A SECOND TIME BUT JOAB WOULD NOT COME

THEN HE SAID TO HIS SERVANTS SEE JOAB'S FIELD IS NEXT TO MINE AND HE HAS BARLEY THERE; GO AND SET IT ON FIRE

 SO ABSALOM'S SERVANTS SET THE FIELD ON FIRE

THEN JOAB AROSE AND WENT TO ABSALOM AT HIS HOUSE AND SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOUR SERVANTS SET MY FIELD ON FIRE

 ABSALOM ANSWERED JOAB BEHOLD I SENT WORD TO YOU 'COME HERE THAT I MAY SEND YOU TO THE KING TO ASK WHY HAVE I COME FROM GESHUR

IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO BE THERE STILL

 NOW THEREFORE LET ME GO INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING AND IF THERE IS GUILT IN ME LET HIM PUT ME TO DEATH

' THEN JOAB WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM AND HE SUMMONED ABSALOM

SO HE CAME TO THE KING AND BOWED HIMSELF ON HIS FACE TO THE GROUND BEFORE THE KING AND THE KING KISSED ABSALOM

AFTER THIS ABSALOM GOT HIMSELF A CHARIOT AND HORSES AND FIFTY MEN TO RUN BEFORE HIM

AND ABSALOM USED TO RISE EARLY AND STAND BESIDE THE WAY OF THE GATE

AND WHEN ANY MAN HAD A DISPUTE TO COME BEFORE THE KING FOR JUDGMENT ABSALOM WOULD CALL TO HIM AND SAY FROM WHAT CITY ARE YOU

 AND WHEN HE SAID YOUR SERVANT IS OF SUCH AND SUCH A TRIBE IN ISRAEL ABSALOM WOULD SAY TO HIM SEE YOUR CLAIMS ARE GOOD AND RIGHT BUT THERE IS NO MAN DESIGNATED BY THE KING TO HEAR YOU

 THEN ABSALOM WOULD SAY OH THAT I WERE JUDGE IN THE LAND

THEN EVERY MAN WITH A DISPUTE OR CAUSE MIGHT COME TO ME AND I WOULD GIVE HIM JUSTICE

 AND WHENEVER A MAN CAME NEAR TO PAY HOMAGE TO HIM HE WOULD PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TAKE HOLD OF HIM AND KISS HIM

THUS ABSALOM DID TO ALL OF ISRAEL WHO CAME TO THE KING FOR JUDGMENT

SO ABSALOM STOLE THE HEARTS OF THE MEN OF ISRAEL

AND AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS ABSALOM SAID TO THE KING PLEASE LET ME GO AND PAY MY VOW WHICH I HAVE VOWED TO THE LORD IN HEBRON

FOR YOUR SERVANT VOWED A VOW WHILE I LIVED AT GESHUR IN ARAM SAYING 'IF THE LORD WILL INDEED BRING ME BACK TO JERUSALEM THEN I WILL OFFER WORSHIP TO THE LORD

' THE KING SAID TO HIM GO IN PEACE

 SO HE AROSE AND WENT TO HEBRON

BUT ABSALOM SENT SECRET MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL SAYING AS SOON AS YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THEN SAY 'ABSALOM IS KING AT HEBRON

' WITH ABSALOM WENT TWO HUNDRED MEN FROM JERUSALEM WHO WERE INVITED GUESTS AND THEY WENT IN THEIR INNOCENCE AND KNEW NOTHING

AND WHILE ABSALOM WAS OFFERING THE SACRIFICES HE SENT FOR AHITHOPHEL THE GILONITE DAVID'S COUNSELOR FROM HIS CITY GILOH

AND THE CONSPIRACY GREW STRONG AND THE PEOPLE WITH ABSALOM KEPT INCREASING

AND A MESSENGER CAME TO DAVID SAYING THE HEARTS OF THE MEN OF ISRAEL HAVE GONE AFTER ABSALOM

 THEN DAVID SAID TO ALL HIS SERVANTS WHO WERE WITH HIM AT JERUSALEM ARISE AND LET US FLEE OR ELSE THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE FOR US FROM ABSALOM

GO QUICKLY LEST HE OVERTAKE US QUICKLY AND BRING DOWN RUIN ON US AND STRIKE THE CITY WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

 AND THE KING'S SERVANTS SAID TO THE KING BEHOLD YOUR SERVANTS ARE READY TO DO WHATEVER MY LORD THE KING DECIDES

 SO THE KING WENT OUT AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM

AND THE KING LEFT TEN CONCUBINES TO KEEP THE HOUSE

AND THE KING WENT OUT AND ALL THE PEOPLE AFTER HIM

AND THEY HALTED AT THE LAST HOUSE

AND ALL HIS SERVANTS PASSED BY HIM AND ALL THE CHERETHITES AND ALL THE PELETHITES AND ALL THE SIX HUNDRED GITTITES WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM GATH PASSED ON BEFORE THE KING

THEN THE KING SAID TO ITTAI THE GITTITE WHY DO YOU ALSO GO WITH US

GO BACK AND STAY WITH THE KING FOR YOU ARE A FOREIGNER AND ALSO AN EXILE FROM YOUR HOME

YOU CAME ONLY YESTERDAY AND SHALL I TODAY MAKE YOU WANDER ABOUT WITH US SINCE I GO I KNOW NOT WHERE

GO BACK AND TAKE YOUR BROTHERS WITH YOU AND MAY THE LORD SHOW STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO YOU

 BUT ITTAI ANSWERED THE KING AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS MY LORD THE KING LIVES WHEREVER MY LORD THE KING SHALL BE WHETHER FOR DEATH OR FOR LIFE THERE ALSO WILL YOUR SERVANT BE

 AND DAVID SAID TO ITTAI GO THEN PASS ON

 SO ITTAI THE GITTITE PASSED ON WITH ALL HIS MEN AND ALL THE LITTLE ONES WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND ALL THE LAND WEPT ALOUD AS ALL THE PEOPLE PASSED BY AND THE KING CROSSED THE BROOK KIDRON AND ALL THE PEOPLE PASSED ON TOWARD THE WILDERNESS

AND ABIATHAR CAME UP AND BEHOLD ZADOK CAME ALSO WITH ALL THE LEVITES BEARING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF GOD

AND THEY SET DOWN THE ARK OF GOD UNTIL THE PEOPLE HAD ALL PASSED OUT OF THE CITY

THEN THE KING SAID TO ZADOK CARRY THE ARK OF GOD BACK INTO THE CITY

IF I FIND FAVOR IN THE EYES OF THE LORD HE WILL BRING ME BACK AND LET ME SEE BOTH IT AND HIS DWELLING PLACE

BUT IF HE SAYS 'I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN YOU' BEHOLD HERE I AM LET HIM DO TO ME WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

 THE KING ALSO SAID TO ZADOK THE PRIEST ARE YOU NOT A SEER

GO BACK TO THE CITY IN PEACE WITH YOUR TWO SONS AHIMAAZ YOUR SON AND JONATHAN THE SON OF ABIATHAR

SEE I WILL WAIT AT THE FORDS OF THE WILDERNESS UNTIL WORD COMES FROM YOU TO INFORM ME

 SO ZADOK AND ABIATHAR CARRIED THE ARK OF GOD BACK TO JERUSALEM AND THEY REMAINED THERE

BUT DAVID WENT UP THE ASCENT OF THE MOUNT OF OLIVES WEEPING AS HE WENT BAREFOOT AND WITH HIS HEAD COVERED

AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM COVERED THEIR HEADS AND THEY WENT UP WEEPING AS THEY WENT

AND IT WAS TOLD DAVID AHITHOPHEL IS AMONG THE CONSPIRATORS WITH ABSALOM

 AND DAVID SAID O LORD PLEASE TURN THE COUNSEL OF AHITHOPHEL INTO FOOLISHNESS

 WHILE DAVID WAS COMING TO THE SUMMIT WHERE GOD WAS WORSHIPED BEHOLD HUSHAI THE ARCHITE CAME TO MEET HIM WITH HIS COAT TORN AND DIRT ON HIS HEAD

DAVID SAID TO HIM IF YOU GO ON WITH ME YOU WILL BE A BURDEN TO ME

BUT IF YOU RETURN TO THE CITY AND SAY TO ABSALOM 'I WILL BE YOUR SERVANT O KING; AS I HAVE BEEN YOUR FATHER'S SERVANT IN TIME PAST SO NOW I WILL BE YOUR SERVANT' THEN YOU WILL DEFEAT FOR ME THE COUNSEL OF AHITHOPHEL

ARE NOT ZADOK AND ABIATHAR THE PRIESTS WITH YOU THERE

SO WHATEVER YOU HEAR FROM THE KING'S HOUSE TELL IT TO ZADOK AND ABIATHAR THE PRIESTS

BEHOLD THEIR TWO SONS ARE WITH THEM THERE AHIMAAZ ZADOK'S SON AND JONATHAN ABIATHAR'S SON AND BY THEM YOU SHALL SEND TO ME EVERYTHING YOU HEAR

 SO HUSHAI DAVID'S FRIEND CAME INTO THE CITY JUST AS ABSALOM WAS ENTERING JERUSALEM

WHEN DAVID HAD PASSED A LITTLE BEYOND THE SUMMIT ZIBA THE SERVANT OF MEPHIBOSHETH MET HIM WITH A COUPLE OF DONKEYS SADDLED BEARING TWO HUNDRED LOAVES OF BREAD A HUNDRED BUNCHES OF RAISINS A HUNDRED OF SUMMER FRUITS AND A SKIN OF WINE

AND THE KING SAID TO ZIBA WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT THESE

 ZIBA ANSWERED THE DONKEYS ARE FOR THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD TO RIDE ON THE BREAD AND SUMMER FRUIT FOR THE YOUNG MEN TO EAT AND THE WINE FOR THOSE WHO FAINT IN THE WILDERNESS TO DRINK

 AND THE KING SAID AND WHERE IS YOUR MASTER'S SON

 ZIBA SAID TO THE KING BEHOLD HE REMAINS IN JERUSALEM FOR HE SAID 'TODAY THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WILL GIVE ME BACK THE KINGDOM OF MY FATHER

' THEN THE KING SAID TO ZIBA BEHOLD ALL THAT BELONGED TO MEPHIBOSHETH IS NOW YOURS

 AND ZIBA SAID I PAY HOMAGE; LET ME EVER FIND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT MY LORD THE KING

 WHEN KING DAVID CAME TO BAHURIM THERE CAME OUT A MAN OF THE FAMILY OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL WHOSE NAME WAS SHIMEI THE SON OF GERA AND AS HE CAME HE CURSED CONTINUALLY

AND HE THREW STONES AT DAVID AND AT ALL THE SERVANTS OF KING DAVID AND ALL THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE MIGHTY MEN WERE ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT

AND SHIMEI SAID AS HE CURSED GET OUT GET OUT YOU MAN OF BLOOD YOU WORTHLESS MAN

THE LORD HAS AVENGED ON YOU ALL THE BLOOD OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL IN WHOSE PLACE YOU HAVE REIGNED AND THE LORD HAS GIVEN THE KINGDOM INTO THE HAND OF YOUR SON ABSALOM

SEE YOUR EVIL IS ON YOU FOR YOU ARE A MAN OF BLOOD

 THEN ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH SAID TO THE KING WHY SHOULD THIS DEAD DOG CURSE MY LORD THE KING

LET ME GO OVER AND TAKE OFF HIS HEAD

 BUT THE KING SAID WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU YOU SONS OF ZERUIAH

IF HE IS CURSING BECAUSE THE LORD HAS SAID TO HIM 'CURSE DAVID' WHO THEN SHALL SAY 'WHY HAVE YOU DONE SO

' AND DAVID SAID TO ABISHAI AND TO ALL HIS SERVANTS BEHOLD MY OWN SON SEEKS MY LIFE; HOW MUCH MORE NOW MAY THIS BENJAMINITE

LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET HIM CURSE FOR THE LORD HAS TOLD HIM TO

IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD WILL LOOK ON THE WRONG DONE TO ME AND THAT THE LORD WILL REPAY ME WITH GOOD FOR HIS CURSING TODAY

 SO DAVID AND HIS MEN WENT ON THE ROAD WHILE SHIMEI WENT ALONG ON THE HILLSIDE OPPOSITE HIM AND CURSED AS HE WENT AND THREW STONES AT HIM AND FLUNG DUST

AND THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM ARRIVED WEARY AT THE JORDAN

AND THERE HE REFRESHED HIMSELF

NOW ABSALOM AND ALL THE PEOPLE THE MEN OF ISRAEL CAME TO JERUSALEM AND AHITHOPHEL WITH HIM

AND WHEN HUSHAI THE ARCHITE DAVID'S FRIEND CAME TO ABSALOM HUSHAI SAID TO ABSALOM LONG LIVE THE KING

LONG LIVE THE KING

 AND ABSALOM SAID TO HUSHAI IS THIS YOUR LOYALTY TO YOUR FRIEND

WHY DID YOU NOT GO WITH YOUR FRIEND

 AND HUSHAI SAID TO ABSALOM NO FOR WHOM THE LORD AND THIS PEOPLE AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL HAVE CHOSEN HIS I WILL BE AND WITH HIM I WILL REMAIN

AND AGAIN WHOM SHOULD I SERVE

SHOULD IT NOT BE HIS SON

AS I HAVE SERVED YOUR FATHER SO I WILL SERVE YOU

 THEN ABSALOM SAID TO AHITHOPHEL GIVE YOUR COUNSEL

WHAT SHALL WE DO

 AHITHOPHEL SAID TO ABSALOM GO IN TO YOUR FATHER'S CONCUBINES WHOM HE HAS LEFT TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND ALL ISRAEL WILL HEAR THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF A STENCH TO YOUR FATHER AND THE HANDS OF ALL WHO ARE WITH YOU WILL BE STRENGTHENED

 SO THEY PITCHED A TENT FOR ABSALOM ON THE ROOF

AND ABSALOM WENT IN TO HIS FATHER'S CONCUBINES IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL

NOW IN THOSE DAYS THE COUNSEL THAT AHITHOPHEL GAVE WAS AS IF ONE CONSULTED THE WORD OF GOD; SO WAS ALL THE COUNSEL OF AHITHOPHEL ESTEEMED BOTH BY DAVID AND BY ABSALOM

MOREOVER AHITHOPHEL SAID TO ABSALOM LET ME CHOOSE TWELVE THOUSAND MEN AND I WILL ARISE AND PURSUE DAVID TONIGHT

I WILL COME UPON HIM WHILE HE IS WEARY AND DISCOURAGED AND THROW HIM INTO A PANIC AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH HIM WILL FLEE

I WILL STRIKE DOWN ONLY THE KING AND I WILL BRING ALL THE PEOPLE BACK TO YOU AS A BRIDE COMES HOME TO HER HUSBAND

YOU SEEK THE LIFE OF ONLY ONE MAN AND ALL THE PEOPLE WILL BE AT PEACE

 AND THE ADVICE SEEMED RIGHT IN THE EYES OF ABSALOM AND ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL

THEN ABSALOM SAID CALL HUSHAI THE ARCHITE ALSO AND LET US HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY

 AND WHEN HUSHAI CAME TO ABSALOM ABSALOM SAID TO HIM THUS HAS AHITHOPHEL SPOKEN; SHALL WE DO AS HE SAYS

IF NOT YOU SPEAK

 THEN HUSHAI SAID TO ABSALOM THIS TIME THE COUNSEL THAT AHITHOPHEL HAS GIVEN IS NOT GOOD

 HUSHAI SAID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER AND HIS MEN ARE MIGHTY MEN AND THAT THEY ARE ENRAGED LIKE A BEAR ROBBED OF HER CUBS IN THE FIELD

BESIDES YOUR FATHER IS EXPERT IN WAR; HE WILL NOT SPEND THE NIGHT WITH THE PEOPLE

BEHOLD EVEN NOW HE HAS HIDDEN HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE PITS OR IN SOME OTHER PLACE

AND AS SOON AS SOME OF THE PEOPLE FALL AT THE FIRST ATTACK WHOEVER HEARS IT WILL SAY 'THERE HAS BEEN A SLAUGHTER AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW ABSALOM

' THEN EVEN THE VALIANT MAN WHOSE HEART IS LIKE THE HEART OF A LION WILL UTTERLY MELT WITH FEAR FOR ALL ISRAEL KNOWS THAT YOUR FATHER IS A MIGHTY MAN AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE WITH HIM ARE VALIANT MEN

BUT MY COUNSEL IS THAT ALL ISRAEL BE GATHERED TO YOU FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA AS THE SAND BY THE SEA FOR MULTITUDE AND THAT YOU GO TO BATTLE IN PERSON

SO WE SHALL COME UPON HIM IN SOME PLACE WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND AND WE SHALL LIGHT UPON HIM AS THE DEW FALLS ON THE GROUND AND OF HIM AND ALL THE MEN WITH HIM NOT ONE WILL BE LEFT

IF HE WITHDRAWS INTO A CITY THEN ALL ISRAEL WILL BRING ROPES TO THAT CITY AND WE SHALL DRAG IT INTO THE VALLEY UNTIL NOT EVEN A PEBBLE IS TO BE FOUND THERE

 AND ABSALOM AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAID THE COUNSEL OF HUSHAI THE ARCHITE IS BETTER THAN THE COUNSEL OF AHITHOPHEL

 FOR THE LORD HAD ORDAINED TO DEFEAT THE GOOD COUNSEL OF AHITHOPHEL SO THAT THE LORD MIGHT BRING HARM UPON ABSALOM

THEN HUSHAI SAID TO ZADOK AND ABIATHAR THE PRIESTS THUS AND SO DID AHITHOPHEL COUNSEL ABSALOM AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND THUS AND SO HAVE I COUNSELED

NOW THEREFORE SEND QUICKLY AND TELL DAVID 'DO NOT STAY TONIGHT AT THE FORDS OF THE WILDERNESS BUT BY ALL MEANS PASS OVER LEST THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH HIM BE SWALLOWED UP

' NOW JONATHAN AND AHIMAAZ WERE WAITING AT ENROGEL

A FEMALE SERVANT WAS TO GO AND TELL THEM AND THEY WERE TO GO AND TELL KING DAVID FOR THEY WERE NOT TO BE SEEN ENTERING THE CITY

BUT A YOUNG MAN SAW THEM AND TOLD ABSALOM

SO BOTH OF THEM WENT AWAY QUICKLY AND CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A MAN AT BAHURIM WHO HAD A WELL IN HIS COURTYARD

AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO IT

AND THE WOMAN TOOK AND SPREAD A COVERING OVER THE WELL'S MOUTH AND SCATTERED GRAIN ON IT AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF IT

WHEN ABSALOM'S SERVANTS CAME TO THE WOMAN AT THE HOUSE THEY SAID WHERE ARE AHIMAAZ AND JONATHAN

 AND THE WOMAN SAID TO THEM THEY HAVE GONE OVER THE BROOK OF WATER

 AND WHEN THEY HAD SOUGHT AND COULD NOT FIND THEM THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

AFTER THEY HAD GONE THE MEN CAME UP OUT OF THE WELL AND WENT AND TOLD KING DAVID

THEY SAID TO DAVID ARISE AND GO QUICKLY OVER THE WATER FOR THUS AND SO HAS AHITHOPHEL COUNSELED AGAINST YOU

 THEN DAVID AROSE AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND THEY CROSSED THE JORDAN

BY DAYBREAK NOT ONE WAS LEFT WHO HAD NOT CROSSED THE JORDAN

WHEN AHITHOPHEL SAW THAT HIS COUNSEL WAS NOT FOLLOWED HE SADDLED HIS DONKEY AND WENT OFF HOME TO HIS OWN CITY

HE SET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER AND HANGED HIMSELF AND HE DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE TOMB OF HIS FATHER

THEN DAVID CAME TO MAHANAIM

AND ABSALOM CROSSED THE JORDAN WITH ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL

NOW ABSALOM HAD SET AMASA OVER THE ARMY INSTEAD OF JOAB

AMASA WAS THE SON OF A MAN NAMED ITHRA THE ISHMAELITE WHO HAD MARRIED ABIGAL THE DAUGHTER OF NAHASH SISTER OF ZERUIAH JOAB'S MOTHER

AND ISRAEL AND ABSALOM ENCAMPED IN THE LAND OF GILEAD

WHEN DAVID CAME TO MAHANAIM SHOBI THE SON OF NAHASH FROM RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES AND MACHIR THE SON OF AMMIEL FROM LODEBAR AND BARZILLAI THE GILEADITE FROM ROGELIM BROUGHT BEDS BASINS AND EARTHEN VESSELS WHEAT BARLEY FLOUR PARCHED GRAIN BEANS AND LENTILS HONEY AND CURDS AND SHEEP AND CHEESE FROM THE HERD FOR DAVID AND THE PEOPLE WITH HIM TO EAT FOR THEY SAID THE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY AND WEARY AND THIRSTY IN THE WILDERNESS

THEN DAVID MUSTERED THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM AND SET OVER THEM COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS

AND DAVID SENT OUT THE ARMY ONE THIRD UNDER THE COMMAND OF JOAB ONE THIRD UNDER THE COMMAND OF ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH JOAB'S BROTHER AND ONE THIRD UNDER THE COMMAND OF ITTAI THE GITTITE

AND THE KING SAID TO THE MEN I MYSELF WILL ALSO GO OUT WITH YOU

 BUT THE MEN SAID YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT

FOR IF WE FLEE THEY WILL NOT CARE ABOUT US

IF HALF OF US DIE THEY WILL NOT CARE ABOUT US

BUT YOU ARE WORTH TEN THOUSAND OF US

THEREFORE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SEND US HELP FROM THE CITY

 THE KING SAID TO THEM WHATEVER SEEMS BEST TO YOU I WILL DO

 SO THE KING STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE GATE WHILE ALL THE ARMY MARCHED OUT BY HUNDREDS AND BY THOUSANDS

AND THE KING ORDERED JOAB AND ABISHAI AND ITTAI DEAL GENTLY FOR MY SAKE WITH THE YOUNG MAN ABSALOM

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE HEARD WHEN THE KING GAVE ORDERS TO ALL THE COMMANDERS ABOUT ABSALOM

SO THE ARMY WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD AGAINST ISRAEL AND THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN THE FOREST OF EPHRAIM

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE DEFEATED THERE BY THE SERVANTS OF DAVID AND THE LOSS THERE WAS GREAT ON THAT DAY TWENTY THOUSAND MEN

THE BATTLE SPREAD OVER THE FACE OF ALL THE COUNTRY AND THE FOREST DEVOURED MORE PEOPLE THAT DAY THAN THE SWORD

AND ABSALOM HAPPENED TO MEET THE SERVANTS OF DAVID

ABSALOM WAS RIDING ON HIS MULE AND THE MULE WENT UNDER THE THICK BRANCHES OF A GREAT TEREBINTH AND HIS HEAD CAUGHT FAST IN THE OAK AND HE WAS SUSPENDED BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH WHILE THE MULE THAT WAS UNDER HIM WENT ON

AND A CERTAIN MAN SAW IT AND TOLD JOAB BEHOLD I SAW ABSALOM HANGING IN AN OAK

 JOAB SAID TO THE MAN WHO TOLD HIM WHAT YOU SAW HIM

WHY THEN DID YOU NOT STRIKE HIM THERE TO THE GROUND

I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO GIVE YOU TEN PIECES OF SILVER AND A BELT

 BUT THE MAN SAID TO JOAB EVEN IF I FELT IN MY HAND THE WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER I WOULD NOT REACH OUT MY HAND AGAINST THE KING'S SON FOR IN OUR HEARING THE KING COMMANDED YOU AND ABISHAI AND ITTAI 'FOR MY SAKE PROTECT THE YOUNG MAN ABSALOM

' ON THE OTHER HAND IF I HAD DEALT TREACHEROUSLY AGAINST HIS LIFE AND THERE IS NOTHING HIDDEN FROM THE KING THEN YOU YOURSELF WOULD HAVE STOOD ALOOF

 JOAB SAID I WILL NOT WASTE TIME LIKE THIS WITH YOU

 AND HE TOOK THREE JAVELINS IN HIS HAND AND THRUST THEM INTO THE HEART OF ABSALOM WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE IN THE OAK

AND TEN YOUNG MEN JOAB'S ARMORBEARERS SURROUNDED ABSALOM AND STRUCK HIM AND KILLED HIM

THEN JOAB BLEW THE TRUMPET AND THE TROOPS CAME BACK FROM PURSUING ISRAEL FOR JOAB RESTRAINED THEM

AND THEY TOOK ABSALOM AND THREW HIM INTO A GREAT PIT IN THE FOREST AND RAISED OVER HIM A VERY GREAT HEAP OF STONES

AND ALL ISRAEL FLED EVERY ONE TO HIS OWN HOME

NOW ABSALOM IN HIS LIFETIME HAD TAKEN AND SET UP FOR HIMSELF THE PILLAR THAT IS IN THE KING'S VALLEY FOR HE SAID I HAVE NO SON TO KEEP MY NAME IN REMEMBRANCE

 HE CALLED THE PILLAR AFTER HIS OWN NAME AND IT IS CALLED ABSALOM'S MONUMENT TO THIS DAY

THEN AHIMAAZ THE SON OF ZADOK SAID LET ME RUN AND CARRY NEWS TO THE KING THAT THE LORD HAS DELIVERED HIM FROM THE HAND OF HIS ENEMIES

 AND JOAB SAID TO HIM YOU ARE NOT TO CARRY NEWS TODAY

YOU MAY CARRY NEWS ANOTHER DAY BUT TODAY YOU SHALL CARRY NO NEWS BECAUSE THE KING'S SON IS DEAD

 THEN JOAB SAID TO THE CUSHITE GO TELL THE KING WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN

 THE CUSHITE BOWED BEFORE JOAB AND RAN

THEN AHIMAAZ THE SON OF ZADOK SAID AGAIN TO JOAB COME WHAT MAY LET ME ALSO RUN AFTER THE CUSHITE

 AND JOAB SAID WHY WILL YOU RUN MY SON SEEING THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO REWARD FOR THE NEWS

 COME WHAT MAY HE SAID I WILL RUN

 SO HE SAID TO HIM RUN

 THEN AHIMAAZ RAN BY THE WAY OF THE PLAIN AND OUTRAN THE CUSHITE

NOW DAVID WAS SITTING BETWEEN THE TWO GATES AND THE WATCHMAN WENT UP TO THE ROOF OF THE GATE BY THE WALL AND WHEN HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED HE SAW A MAN RUNNING ALONE

THE WATCHMAN CALLED OUT AND TOLD THE KING

AND THE KING SAID IF HE IS ALONE THERE IS NEWS IN HIS MOUTH

 AND HE DREW NEARER AND NEARER

THE WATCHMAN SAW ANOTHER MAN RUNNING

AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED TO THE GATE AND SAID SEE ANOTHER MAN RUNNING ALONE

 THE KING SAID HE ALSO BRINGS NEWS

 THE WATCHMAN SAID I THINK THE RUNNING OF THE FIRST IS LIKE THE RUNNING OF AHIMAAZ THE SON OF ZADOK

 AND THE KING SAID HE IS A GOOD MAN AND COMES WITH GOOD NEWS

 THEN AHIMAAZ CRIED OUT TO THE KING ALL IS WELL

 AND HE BOWED BEFORE THE KING WITH HIS FACE TO THE EARTH AND SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS DELIVERED UP THE MEN WHO RAISED THEIR HAND AGAINST MY LORD THE KING

 AND THE KING SAID IS IT WELL WITH THE YOUNG MAN ABSALOM

 AHIMAAZ ANSWERED WHEN JOAB SENT THE KING'S SERVANT YOUR SERVANT I SAW A GREAT COMMOTION BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS

 AND THE KING SAID TURN ASIDE AND STAND HERE

 SO HE TURNED ASIDE AND STOOD STILL

AND BEHOLD THE CUSHITE CAME AND THE CUSHITE SAID GOOD NEWS FOR MY LORD THE KING

FOR THE LORD HAS DELIVERED YOU THIS DAY FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO ROSE UP AGAINST YOU

 THE KING SAID TO THE CUSHITE IS IT WELL WITH THE YOUNG MAN ABSALOM

 AND THE CUSHITE ANSWERED MAY THE ENEMIES OF MY LORD THE KING AND ALL WHO RISE UP AGAINST YOU FOR EVIL BE LIKE THAT YOUNG MAN

 AND THE KING WAS DEEPLY MOVED AND WENT UP TO THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE AND WEPT

AND AS HE WENT HE SAID O MY SON ABSALOM MY SON MY SON ABSALOM

WOULD I HAD DIED INSTEAD OF YOU O ABSALOM MY SON MY SON

IT WAS TOLD JOAB BEHOLD THE KING IS WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR ABSALOM

 SO THE VICTORY THAT DAY WAS TURNED INTO MOURNING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE HEARD THAT DAY THE KING IS GRIEVING FOR HIS SON

 AND THE PEOPLE STOLE INTO THE CITY THAT DAY AS PEOPLE STEAL IN WHO ARE ASHAMED WHEN THEY FLEE IN BATTLE

THE KING COVERED HIS FACE AND THE KING CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE O MY SON ABSALOM O ABSALOM MY SON MY SON

 THEN JOAB CAME INTO THE HOUSE TO THE KING AND SAID YOU HAVE TODAY COVERED WITH SHAME THE FACES OF ALL YOUR SERVANTS WHO HAVE THIS DAY SAVED YOUR LIFE AND THE LIVES OF YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS AND THE LIVES OF YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CONCUBINES BECAUSE YOU LOVE THOSE WHO HATE YOU AND HATE THOSE WHO LOVE YOU

FOR YOU HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TODAY THAT COMMANDERS AND SERVANTS ARE NOTHING TO YOU FOR TODAY I KNOW THAT IF ABSALOM WERE ALIVE AND ALL OF US WERE DEAD TODAY THEN YOU WOULD BE PLEASED

NOW THEREFORE ARISE GO OUT AND SPEAK KINDLY TO YOUR SERVANTS FOR I SWEAR BY THE LORD IF YOU DO NOT GO NOT A MAN WILL STAY WITH YOU THIS NIGHT AND THIS WILL BE WORSE FOR YOU THAN ALL THE EVIL THAT HAS COME UPON YOU FROM YOUR YOUTH UNTIL NOW THEN THE KING AROSE AND TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE GATE

AND THE PEOPLE WERE ALL TOLD BEHOLD THE KING IS SITTING IN THE GATE

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME BEFORE THE KING

NOW ISRAEL HAD FLED EVERY MAN TO HIS HOME

AND ALL THE PEOPLE WERE ARGUING THROUGHOUT ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL SAYING THE KING DELIVERED US FROM THE HAND OF OUR ENEMIES AND SAVED US FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND NOW HE HAS FLED OUT OF THE LAND FROM ABSALOM

BUT ABSALOM WHOM WE ANOINTED OVER US IS DEAD IN BATTLE

NOW THEREFORE WHY DO YOU SAY NOTHING ABOUT BRINGING THE KING BACK

 AND KING DAVID SENT THIS MESSAGE TO ZADOK AND ABIATHAR THE PRIESTS SAY TO THE ELDERS OF JUDAH 'WHY SHOULD YOU BE THE LAST TO BRING THE KING BACK TO HIS HOUSE WHEN THE WORD OF ALL ISRAEL HAS COME TO THE KING

YOU ARE MY BROTHERS; YOU ARE MY BONE AND MY FLESH

WHY THEN SHOULD YOU BE THE LAST TO BRING BACK THE KING

' AND SAY TO AMASA 'ARE YOU NOT MY BONE AND MY FLESH

GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF YOU ARE NOT COMMANDER OF MY ARMY FROM NOW ON IN PLACE OF JOAB

' AND HE SWAYED THE HEART OF ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH AS ONE MAN SO THAT THEY SENT WORD TO THE KING RETURN BOTH YOU AND ALL YOUR SERVANTS

 SO THE KING CAME BACK TO THE JORDAN AND JUDAH CAME TO GILGAL TO MEET THE KING AND TO BRING THE KING OVER THE JORDAN

AND SHIMEI THE SON OF GERA THE BENJAMINITE FROM BAHURIM HURRIED TO COME DOWN WITH THE MEN OF JUDAH TO MEET KING DAVID

AND WITH HIM WERE A THOUSAND MEN FROM BENJAMIN

AND ZIBA THE SERVANT OF THE HOUSE OF SAUL WITH HIS FIFTEEN SONS AND HIS TWENTY SERVANTS RUSHED DOWN TO THE JORDAN BEFORE THE KING AND THEY CROSSED THE FORD TO BRING OVER THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD AND TO DO HIS PLEASURE

AND SHIMEI THE SON OF GERA FELL DOWN BEFORE THE KING AS HE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS THE JORDAN AND SAID TO THE KING LET NOT MY LORD HOLD ME GUILTY OR REMEMBER HOW YOUR SERVANT DID WRONG ON THE DAY MY LORD THE KING LEFT JERUSALEM

DO NOT LET THE KING TAKE IT TO HEART

FOR YOUR SERVANT KNOWS THAT I HAVE SINNED

THEREFORE BEHOLD I HAVE COME THIS DAY THE FIRST OF ALL THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH TO COME DOWN TO MEET MY LORD THE KING

 ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH ANSWERED SHALL NOT SHIMEI BE PUT TO DEATH FOR THIS BECAUSE HE CURSED THE LORD'S ANOINTED

 BUT DAVID SAID WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU YOU SONS OF ZERUIAH THAT YOU SHOULD THIS DAY BE AS AN ADVERSARY TO ME

SHALL ANYONE BE PUT TO DEATH IN ISRAEL THIS DAY

FOR DO I NOT KNOW THAT I AM THIS DAY KING OVER ISRAEL

 AND THE KING SAID TO SHIMEI YOU SHALL NOT DIE

 AND THE KING GAVE HIM HIS OATH

AND MEPHIBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL CAME DOWN TO MEET THE KING

HE HAD NEITHER TAKEN CARE OF HIS FEET NOR TRIMMED HIS BEARD NOR WASHED HIS CLOTHES FROM THE DAY THE KING DEPARTED UNTIL THE DAY HE CAME BACK IN SAFETY

AND WHEN HE CAME TO JERUSALEM TO MEET THE KING THE KING SAID TO HIM WHY DID YOU NOT GO WITH ME MEPHIBOSHETH

 HE ANSWERED MY LORD O KING MY SERVANT DECEIVED ME FOR YOUR SERVANT SAID TO HIM 'I WILL SADDLE A DONKEY FOR MYSELF THAT I MAY RIDE ON IT AND GO WITH THE KING

' FOR YOUR SERVANT IS LAME

HE HAS SLANDERED YOUR SERVANT TO MY LORD THE KING

BUT MY LORD THE KING IS LIKE THE ANGEL OF GOD; DO THEREFORE WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

FOR ALL MY FATHER'S HOUSE WERE BUT MEN DOOMED TO DEATH BEFORE MY LORD THE KING BUT YOU SET YOUR SERVANT AMONG THOSE WHO EAT AT YOUR TABLE

WHAT FURTHER RIGHT HAVE I THEN TO CRY TO THE KING

 AND THE KING SAID TO HIM WHY SPEAK ANY MORE OF YOUR AFFAIRS

I HAVE DECIDED YOU AND ZIBA SHALL DIVIDE THE LAND

 AND MEPHIBOSHETH SAID TO THE KING OH LET HIM TAKE IT ALL SINCE MY LORD THE KING HAS COME SAFELY HOME

 NOW BARZILLAI THE GILEADITE HAD COME DOWN FROM ROGELIM AND HE WENT ON WITH THE KING TO THE JORDAN TO ESCORT HIM OVER THE JORDAN

BARZILLAI WAS A VERY AGED MAN EIGHTY YEARS OLD

HE HAD PROVIDED THE KING WITH FOOD WHILE HE STAYED AT MAHANAIM FOR HE WAS A VERY WEALTHY MAN

AND THE KING SAID TO BARZILLAI COME OVER WITH ME AND I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU WITH ME IN JERUSALEM

 BUT BARZILLAI SAID TO THE KING HOW MANY YEARS HAVE I STILL TO LIVE THAT I SHOULD GO UP WITH THE KING TO JERUSALEM

I AM THIS DAY EIGHTY YEARS OLD

CAN I DISCERN WHAT IS PLEASANT AND WHAT IS NOT

CAN YOUR SERVANT TASTE WHAT HE EATS OR WHAT HE DRINKS

CAN I STILL LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF SINGING MEN AND SINGING WOMEN

WHY THEN SHOULD YOUR SERVANT BE AN ADDED BURDEN TO MY LORD THE KING

YOUR SERVANT WILL GO A LITTLE WAY OVER THE JORDAN WITH THE KING

WHY SHOULD THE KING REPAY ME WITH SUCH A REWARD

PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT RETURN THAT I MAY DIE IN MY OWN CITY NEAR THE GRAVE OF MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER

BUT HERE IS YOUR SERVANT CHIMHAM

LET HIM GO OVER WITH MY LORD THE KING AND DO FOR HIM WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

 AND THE KING ANSWERED CHIMHAM SHALL GO OVER WITH ME AND I WILL DO FOR HIM WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU AND ALL THAT YOU DESIRE OF ME I WILL DO FOR YOU

 THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OVER THE JORDAN AND THE KING WENT OVER

AND THE KING KISSED BARZILLAI AND BLESSED HIM AND HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN HOME

THE KING WENT ON TO GILGAL AND CHIMHAM WENT ON WITH HIM

ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND ALSO HALF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT THE KING ON HIS WAY

THEN ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL CAME TO THE KING AND SAID TO THE KING WHY HAVE OUR BROTHERS THE MEN OF JUDAH STOLEN YOU AWAY AND BROUGHT THE KING AND HIS HOUSEHOLD OVER THE JORDAN AND ALL DAVID'S MEN WITH HIM

 ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH ANSWERED THE MEN OF ISRAEL BECAUSE THE KING IS OUR CLOSE RELATIVE

WHY THEN ARE YOU ANGRY OVER THIS MATTER

HAVE WE EATEN AT ALL AT THE KING'S EXPENSE

OR HAS HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT

 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH WE HAVE TEN SHARES IN THE KING AND IN DAVID ALSO WE HAVE MORE THAN YOU

WHY THEN DID YOU DESPISE US

WERE WE NOT THE FIRST TO SPEAK OF BRINGING BACK OUR KING

 BUT THE WORDS OF THE MEN OF JUDAH WERE FIERCER THAN THE WORDS OF THE MEN OF ISRAEL

NOW THERE HAPPENED TO BE THERE A WORTHLESS MAN WHOSE NAME WAS SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI A BENJAMINITE

AND HE BLEW THE TRUMPET AND SAID WE HAVE NO PORTION IN DAVID AND WE HAVE NO INHERITANCE IN THE SON OF JESSE; EVERY MAN TO HIS TENTS O ISRAEL

 SO ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL WITHDREW FROM DAVID AND FOLLOWED SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI

BUT THE MEN OF JUDAH FOLLOWED THEIR KING STEADFASTLY FROM THE JORDAN TO JERUSALEM

AND DAVID CAME TO HIS HOUSE AT JERUSALEM

AND THE KING TOOK THE TEN CONCUBINES WHOM HE HAD LEFT TO CARE FOR THE HOUSE AND PUT THEM IN A HOUSE UNDER GUARD AND PROVIDED FOR THEM BUT DID NOT GO IN TO THEM

SO THEY WERE SHUT UP UNTIL THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH LIVING AS IF IN WIDOWHOOD

THEN THE KING SAID TO AMASA CALL THE MEN OF JUDAH TOGETHER TO ME WITHIN THREE DAYS AND BE HERE YOURSELF

 SO AMASA WENT TO SUMMON JUDAH BUT HE DELAYED BEYOND THE SET TIME THAT HAD BEEN APPOINTED HIM

AND DAVID SAID TO ABISHAI NOW SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI WILL DO US MORE HARM THAN ABSALOM

TAKE YOUR LORD'S SERVANTS AND PURSUE HIM LEST HE GET HIMSELF TO FORTIFIED CITIES AND ESCAPE FROM US

 AND THERE WENT OUT AFTER HIM JOAB'S MEN AND THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY MEN

THEY WENT OUT FROM JERUSALEM TO PURSUE SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI

WHEN THEY WERE AT THE GREAT STONE THAT IS IN GIBEON AMASA CAME TO MEET THEM

NOW JOAB WAS WEARING A SOLDIER'S GARMENT AND OVER IT WAS A BELT WITH A SWORD IN ITS SHEATH FASTENED ON HIS THIGH AND AS HE WENT FORWARD IT FELL OUT

AND JOAB SAID TO AMASA IS IT WELL WITH YOU MY BROTHER

 AND JOAB TOOK AMASA BY THE BEARD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TO KISS HIM

BUT AMASA DID NOT OBSERVE THE SWORD THAT WAS IN JOAB'S HAND

SO JOAB STRUCK HIM WITH IT IN THE STOMACH AND SPILLED HIS ENTRAILS TO THE GROUND WITHOUT STRIKING A SECOND BLOW AND HE DIED

THEN JOAB AND ABISHAI HIS BROTHER PURSUED SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI

AND ONE OF JOAB'S YOUNG MEN TOOK HIS STAND BY AMASA AND SAID WHOEVER FAVORS JOAB AND WHOEVER IS FOR DAVID LET HIM FOLLOW JOAB

 AND AMASA LAY WALLOWING IN HIS BLOOD IN THE HIGHWAY

AND ANYONE WHO CAME BY SEEING HIM STOPPED

AND WHEN THE MAN SAW THAT ALL THE PEOPLE STOPPED HE CARRIED AMASA OUT OF THE HIGHWAY INTO THE FIELD AND THREW A GARMENT OVER HIM

WHEN HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE HIGHWAY ALL THE PEOPLE WENT ON AFTER JOAB TO PURSUE SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI

AND SHEBA PASSED THROUGH ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO ABEL OF BETHMAACAH AND ALL THE BICHRITES ASSEMBLED AND FOLLOWED HIM IN

AND ALL THE MEN WHO WERE WITH JOAB CAME AND BESIEGED HIM IN ABEL OF BETHMAACAH

THEY CAST UP A MOUND AGAINST THE CITY AND IT STOOD AGAINST THE RAMPART AND THEY WERE BATTERING THE WALL TO THROW IT DOWN

THEN A WISE WOMAN CALLED FROM THE CITY LISTEN

LISTEN

TELL JOAB 'COME HERE THAT I MAY SPEAK TO YOU

' AND HE CAME NEAR HER AND THE WOMAN SAID ARE YOU JOAB

 HE ANSWERED I AM

 THEN SHE SAID TO HIM LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF YOUR SERVANT

 AND HE ANSWERED I AM LISTENING

 THEN SHE SAID THEY USED TO SAY IN FORMER TIMES 'LET THEM BUT ASK COUNSEL AT ABEL' AND SO THEY SETTLED A MATTER

I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO ARE PEACEABLE AND FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL

YOU SEEK TO DESTROY A CITY THAT IS A MOTHER IN ISRAEL

WHY WILL YOU SWALLOW UP THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD

 JOAB ANSWERED FAR BE IT FROM ME FAR BE IT THAT I SHOULD SWALLOW UP OR DESTROY

THAT IS NOT TRUE

BUT A MAN OF THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM CALLED SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI HAS LIFTED UP HIS HAND AGAINST KING DAVID

GIVE UP HIM ALONE AND I WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE CITY

 AND THE WOMAN SAID TO JOAB BEHOLD HIS HEAD SHALL BE THROWN TO YOU OVER THE WALL

 THEN THE WOMAN WENT TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM

AND THEY CUT OFF THE HEAD OF SHEBA THE SON OF BICHRI AND THREW IT OUT TO JOAB

SO HE BLEW THE TRUMPET AND THEY DISPERSED FROM THE CITY EVERY MAN TO HIS HOME

AND JOAB RETURNED TO JERUSALEM TO THE KING

NOW JOAB WAS IN COMMAND OF ALL THE ARMY OF ISRAEL; AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS IN COMMAND OF THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES; AND ADORAM WAS IN CHARGE OF THE FORCED LABOR; AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF AHILUD WAS THE RECORDER; AND SHEVA WAS SECRETARY; AND ZADOK AND ABIATHAR WERE PRIESTS; AND IRA THE JAIRITE WAS ALSO DAVID'S PRIEST

NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE DAYS OF DAVID FOR THREE YEARS YEAR AFTER YEAR

AND DAVID SOUGHT THE FACE OF THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID THERE IS BLOODGUILT ON SAUL AND ON HIS HOUSE BECAUSE HE PUT THE GIBEONITES TO DEATH

 SO THE KING CALLED THE GIBEONITES AND SPOKE TO THEM

NOW THE GIBEONITES WERE NOT OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BUT OF THE REMNANT OF THE AMORITES

ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD SWORN TO SPARE THEM SAUL HAD SOUGHT TO STRIKE THEM DOWN IN HIS ZEAL FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH

AND DAVID SAID TO THE GIBEONITES WHAT SHALL I DO FOR YOU

AND HOW SHALL I MAKE ATONEMENT THAT YOU MAY BLESS THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD

 THE GIBEONITES SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT A MATTER OF SILVER OR GOLD BETWEEN US AND SAUL OR HIS HOUSE; NEITHER IS IT FOR US TO PUT ANY MAN TO DEATH IN ISRAEL

 AND HE SAID WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT I SHALL DO FOR YOU

 THEY SAID TO THE KING THE MAN WHO CONSUMED US AND PLANNED TO DESTROY US SO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE IN ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL LET SEVEN OF HIS SONS BE GIVEN TO US SO THAT WE MAY HANG THEM BEFORE THE LORD AT GIBEAH OF SAUL THE CHOSEN OF THE LORD

 AND THE KING SAID I WILL GIVE THEM

 BUT THE KING SPARED MEPHIBOSHETH THE SON OF SAUL'S SON JONATHAN BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF THE LORD THAT WAS BETWEEN THEM BETWEEN DAVID AND JONATHAN THE SON OF SAUL

THE KING TOOK THE TWO SONS OF RIZPAH THE DAUGHTER OF AIAH WHOM SHE BORE TO SAUL ARMONI AND MEPHIBOSHETH; AND THE FIVE SONS OF MERAB THE DAUGHTER OF SAUL WHOM SHE BORE TO ADRIEL THE SON OF BARZILLAI THE MEHOLATHITE; AND HE GAVE THEM INTO THE HANDS OF THE GIBEONITES AND THEY HANGED THEM ON THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE THE LORD AND THE SEVEN OF THEM PERISHED TOGETHER

THEY WERE PUT TO DEATH IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HARVEST AT THE BEGINNING OF BARLEY HARVEST

THEN RIZPAH THE DAUGHTER OF AIAH TOOK SACKCLOTH AND SPREAD IT FOR HERSELF ON THE ROCK FROM THE BEGINNING OF HARVEST UNTIL RAIN FELL UPON THEM FROM THE HEAVENS

AND SHE DID NOT ALLOW THE BIRDS OF THE AIR TO COME UPON THEM BY DAY OR THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD BY NIGHT

WHEN DAVID WAS TOLD WHAT RIZPAH THE DAUGHTER OF AIAH THE CONCUBINE OF SAUL HAD DONE DAVID WENT AND TOOK THE BONES OF SAUL AND THE BONES OF HIS SON JONATHAN FROM THE MEN OF JABESHGILEAD WHO HAD STOLEN THEM FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE OF BETHSHAN WHERE THE PHILISTINES HAD HANGED THEM ON THE DAY THE PHILISTINES KILLED SAUL ON GILBOA

AND HE BROUGHT UP FROM THERE THE BONES OF SAUL AND THE BONES OF HIS SON JONATHAN; AND THEY GATHERED THE BONES OF THOSE WHO WERE HANGED

AND THEY BURIED THE BONES OF SAUL AND HIS SON JONATHAN IN THE LAND OF BENJAMIN IN ZELA IN THE TOMB OF KISH HIS FATHER

AND THEY DID ALL THAT THE KING COMMANDED

AND AFTER THAT GOD RESPONDED TO THE PLEA FOR THE LAND

THERE WAS WAR AGAIN BETWEEN THE PHILISTINES AND ISRAEL AND DAVID WENT DOWN TOGETHER WITH HIS SERVANTS AND THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

AND DAVID GREW WEARY

AND ISHBIBENOB ONE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THE GIANTS WHOSE SPEAR WEIGHED THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS OF BRONZE AND WHO WAS ARMED WITH A NEW SWORD THOUGHT TO KILL DAVID

BUT ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH CAME TO HIS AID AND ATTACKED THE PHILISTINE AND KILLED HIM

THEN DAVID'S MEN SWORE TO HIM YOU SHALL NO LONGER GO OUT WITH US TO BATTLE LEST YOU QUENCH THE LAMP OF ISRAEL

 AFTER THIS THERE WAS AGAIN WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES AT GOB

THEN SIBBECAI THE HUSHATHITE STRUCK DOWN SAPH WHO WAS ONE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THE GIANTS

AND THERE WAS AGAIN WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES AT GOB AND ELHANAN THE SON OF JAAREOREGIM THE BETHLEHEMITE STRUCK DOWN GOLIATH THE GITTITE THE SHAFT OF WHOSE SPEAR WAS LIKE A WEAVER'S BEAM

AND THERE WAS AGAIN WAR AT GATH WHERE THERE WAS A MAN OF GREAT STATURE WHO HAD SIX FINGERS ON EACH HAND AND SIX TOES ON EACH FOOT TWENTYFOUR IN NUMBER AND HE ALSO WAS DESCENDED FROM THE GIANTS

AND WHEN HE TAUNTED ISRAEL JONATHAN THE SON OF SHIMEI DAVID'S BROTHER STRUCK HIM DOWN

THESE FOUR WERE DESCENDED FROM THE GIANTS IN GATH AND THEY FELL BY THE HAND OF DAVID AND BY THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS

AND DAVID SPOKE TO THE LORD THE WORDS OF THIS SONG ON THE DAY WHEN THE LORD DELIVERED HIM FROM THE HAND OF ALL HIS ENEMIES AND FROM THE HAND OF SAUL

HE SAID THE LORD IS MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS AND MY DELIVERER MY GOD MY ROCK IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE MY SHIELD AND THE HORN OF MY SALVATION MY STRONGHOLD AND MY REFUGE MY SAVIOR; YOU SAVE ME FROM VIOLENCE

I CALL UPON THE LORD WHO IS WORTHY TO BE PRAISED AND I AM SAVED FROM MY ENEMIES

FOR THE WAVES OF DEATH ENCOMPASSED ME THE TORRENTS OF DESTRUCTION ASSAILED ME; THE CORDS OF SHEOL ENTANGLED ME; THE SNARES OF DEATH CONFRONTED ME

IN MY DISTRESS I CALLED UPON THE LORD; TO MY GOD I CALLED

FROM HIS TEMPLE HE HEARD MY VOICE AND MY CRY CAME TO HIS EARS

THEN THE EARTH REELED AND ROCKED; THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HEAVENS TREMBLED AND QUAKED BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY

SMOKE WENT UP FROM HIS NOSTRILS AND DEVOURING FIRE FROM HIS MOUTH; GLOWING COALS FLAMED FORTH FROM HIM

HE BOWED THE HEAVENS AND CAME DOWN; THICK DARKNESS WAS UNDER HIS FEET

HE RODE ON A CHERUB AND FLEW; HE WAS SEEN ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND

HE MADE DARKNESS AROUND HIM HIS CANOPY THICK CLOUDS A GATHERING OF WATER

OUT OF THE BRIGHTNESS BEFORE HIM COALS OF FIRE FLAMED FORTH

THE LORD THUNDERED FROM HEAVEN AND THE MOST HIGH UTTERED HIS VOICE

AND HE SENT OUT ARROWS AND SCATTERED THEM; LIGHTNING AND ROUTED THEM

THEN THE CHANNELS OF THE SEA WERE SEEN; THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD WERE LAID BARE AT THE REBUKE OF THE LORD AT THE BLAST OF THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS

HE SENT FROM ON HIGH HE TOOK ME; HE DREW ME OUT OF MANY WATERS

HE RESCUED ME FROM MY STRONG ENEMY FROM THOSE WHO HATED ME FOR THEY WERE TOO MIGHTY FOR ME

THEY CONFRONTED ME IN THE DAY OF MY CALAMITY BUT THE LORD WAS MY SUPPORT

HE BROUGHT ME OUT INTO A BROAD PLACE; HE RESCUED ME BECAUSE HE DELIGHTED IN ME

THE LORD DEALT WITH ME ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS; ACCORDING TO THE CLEANNESS OF MY HANDS HE REWARDED ME

FOR I HAVE KEPT THE WAYS OF THE LORD AND HAVE NOT WICKEDLY DEPARTED FROM MY GOD

FOR ALL HIS RULES WERE BEFORE ME AND FROM HIS STATUTES I DID NOT TURN ASIDE

I WAS BLAMELESS BEFORE HIM AND I KEPT MYSELF FROM GUILT

AND THE LORD HAS REWARDED ME ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS ACCORDING TO MY CLEANNESS IN HIS SIGHT

WITH THE MERCIFUL YOU SHOW YOURSELF MERCIFUL; WITH THE BLAMELESS MAN YOU SHOW YOURSELF BLAMELESS; WITH THE PURIFIED YOU DEAL PURELY AND WITH THE CROOKED YOU MAKE YOURSELF SEEM TORTUOUS

YOU SAVE A HUMBLE PEOPLE BUT YOUR EYES ARE ON THE HAUGHTY TO BRING THEM DOWN

FOR YOU ARE MY LAMP O LORD AND MY GOD LIGHTENS MY DARKNESS

FOR BY YOU I CAN RUN AGAINST A TROOP AND BY MY GOD I CAN LEAP OVER A WALL

THIS GODHIS WAY IS PERFECT; THE WORD OF THE LORD PROVES TRUE; HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

FOR WHO IS GOD BUT THE LORD

AND WHO IS A ROCK EXCEPT OUR GOD

THIS GOD IS MY STRONG REFUGE AND HAS MADE MY WAY BLAMELESS

HE MADE MY FEET LIKE THE FEET OF A DEER AND SET ME SECURE ON THE HEIGHTS

HE TRAINS MY HANDS FOR WAR SO THAT MY ARMS CAN BEND A BOW OF BRONZE

YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE SHIELD OF YOUR SALVATION AND YOUR GENTLENESS MADE ME GREAT

YOU GAVE A WIDE PLACE FOR MY STEPS UNDER ME AND MY FEET DID NOT SLIP; I PURSUED MY ENEMIES AND DESTROYED THEM AND DID NOT TURN BACK UNTIL THEY WERE CONSUMED

I CONSUMED THEM; I THRUST THEM THROUGH SO THAT THEY DID NOT RISE; THEY FELL UNDER MY FEET

FOR YOU EQUIPPED ME WITH STRENGTH FOR THE BATTLE; YOU MADE THOSE WHO RISE AGAINST ME SINK UNDER ME

YOU MADE MY ENEMIES TURN THEIR BACKS TO ME THOSE WHO HATED ME AND I DESTROYED THEM

THEY LOOKED BUT THERE WAS NONE TO SAVE; THEY CRIED TO THE LORD BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THEM

I BEAT THEM FINE AS THE DUST OF THE EARTH; I CRUSHED THEM AND STAMPED THEM DOWN LIKE THE MIRE OF THE STREETS

YOU DELIVERED ME FROM STRIFE WITH MY PEOPLE; YOU KEPT ME AS THE HEAD OF THE NATIONS; PEOPLE WHOM I HAD NOT KNOWN SERVED ME

FOREIGNERS CAME CRINGING TO ME; AS SOON AS THEY HEARD OF ME THEY OBEYED ME

FOREIGNERS LOST HEART AND CAME TREMBLING OUT OF THEIR FORTRESSES

THE LORD LIVES AND BLESSED BE MY ROCK AND EXALTED BE MY GOD THE ROCK OF MY SALVATION THE GOD WHO GAVE ME VENGEANCE AND BROUGHT DOWN PEOPLES UNDER ME WHO BROUGHT ME OUT FROM MY ENEMIES; YOU EXALTED ME ABOVE THOSE WHO ROSE AGAINST ME; YOU DELIVERED ME FROM MEN OF VIOLENCE

FOR THIS I WILL PRAISE YOU O LORD AMONG THE NATIONS AND SING PRAISES TO YOUR NAME

GREAT SALVATION HE BRINGS TO HIS KING AND SHOWS STEADFAST LOVE TO HIS ANOINTED TO DAVID AND HIS OFFSPRING FOREVER

NOW THESE ARE THE LAST WORDS OF DAVID THE ORACLE OF DAVID THE SON OF JESSE THE ORACLE OF THE MAN WHO WAS RAISED ON HIGH THE ANOINTED OF THE GOD OF JACOB THE SWEET PSALMIST OF ISRAEL THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD SPEAKS BY ME; HIS WORD IS ON MY TONGUE

THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SPOKEN; THE ROCK OF ISRAEL HAS SAID TO ME WHEN ONE RULES JUSTLY OVER MEN RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD HE DAWNS ON THEM LIKE THE MORNING LIGHT LIKE THE SUN SHINING FORTH ON A CLOUDLESS MORNING LIKE RAIN THAT MAKES GRASS TO SPROUT FROM THE EARTH

FOR DOES NOT MY HOUSE STAND SO WITH GOD

FOR HE HAS MADE WITH ME AN EVERLASTING COVENANT ORDERED IN ALL THINGS AND SECURE

FOR WILL HE NOT CAUSE TO PROSPER ALL MY HELP AND MY DESIRE

BUT WORTHLESS MEN ARE ALL LIKE THORNS THAT ARE THROWN AWAY FOR THEY CANNOT BE TAKEN WITH THE HAND; BUT THE MAN WHO TOUCHES THEM ARMS HIMSELF WITH IRON AND THE SHAFT OF A SPEAR AND THEY ARE UTTERLY CONSUMED WITH FIRE

 THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MIGHTY MEN WHOM DAVID HAD JOSHEBBASSHEBETH A TAHCHEMONITE; HE WAS CHIEF OF THE THREE

HE WIELDED HIS SPEAR AGAINST EIGHT HUNDRED WHOM HE KILLED AT ONE TIME

AND NEXT TO HIM AMONG THE THREE MIGHTY MEN WAS ELEAZAR THE SON OF DODO SON OF AHOHI

HE WAS WITH DAVID WHEN THEY DEFIED THE PHILISTINES WHO WERE GATHERED THERE FOR BATTLE AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WITHDREW

HE ROSE AND STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINES UNTIL HIS HAND WAS WEARY AND HIS HAND CLUNG TO THE SWORD

AND THE LORD BROUGHT ABOUT A GREAT VICTORY THAT DAY AND THE MEN RETURNED AFTER HIM ONLY TO STRIP THE SLAIN

AND NEXT TO HIM WAS SHAMMAH THE SON OF AGEE THE HARARITE

THE PHILISTINES GATHERED TOGETHER AT LEHI WHERE THERE WAS A PLOT OF GROUND FULL OF LENTILS AND THE MEN FLED FROM THE PHILISTINES

BUT HE TOOK HIS STAND IN THE MIDST OF THE PLOT AND DEFENDED IT AND STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINES AND THE LORD WORKED A GREAT VICTORY

AND THREE OF THE THIRTY CHIEF MEN WENT DOWN AND CAME ABOUT HARVEST TIME TO DAVID AT THE CAVE OF ADULLAM WHEN A BAND OF PHILISTINES WAS ENCAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

DAVID WAS THEN IN THE STRONGHOLD AND THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES WAS THEN AT BETHLEHEM

AND DAVID SAID LONGINGLY OH THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE ME WATER TO DRINK FROM THE WELL OF BETHLEHEM THAT IS BY THE GATE

 THEN THE THREE MIGHTY MEN BROKE THROUGH THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND DREW WATER OUT OF THE WELL OF BETHLEHEM THAT WAS BY THE GATE AND CARRIED AND BROUGHT IT TO DAVID

BUT HE WOULD NOT DRINK OF IT

HE POURED IT OUT TO THE LORD AND SAID FAR BE IT FROM ME O LORD THAT I SHOULD DO THIS

SHALL I DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE MEN WHO WENT AT THE RISK OF THEIR LIVES

 THEREFORE HE WOULD NOT DRINK IT

THESE THINGS THE THREE MIGHTY MEN DID

NOW ABISHAI THE BROTHER OF JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH WAS CHIEF OF THE THIRTY

AND HE WIELDED HIS SPEAR AGAINST THREE HUNDRED MEN AND KILLED THEM AND WON A NAME BESIDE THE THREE

HE WAS THE MOST RENOWNED OF THE THIRTY AND BECAME THEIR COMMANDER BUT HE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THE THREE

AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS A VALIANT MAN OF KABZEEL A DOER OF GREAT DEEDS

HE STRUCK DOWN TWO ARIELS OF MOAB

HE ALSO WENT DOWN AND STRUCK DOWN A LION IN A PIT ON A DAY WHEN SNOW HAD FALLEN

AND HE STRUCK DOWN AN EGYPTIAN A HANDSOME MAN

THE EGYPTIAN HAD A SPEAR IN HIS HAND BUT BENAIAH WENT DOWN TO HIM WITH A STAFF AND SNATCHED THE SPEAR OUT OF THE EGYPTIAN'S HAND AND KILLED HIM WITH HIS OWN SPEAR

THESE THINGS DID BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND WON A NAME BESIDE THE THREE MIGHTY MEN

HE WAS RENOWNED AMONG THE THIRTY BUT HE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THE THREE

AND DAVID SET HIM OVER HIS BODYGUARD

ASAHEL THE BROTHER OF JOAB WAS ONE OF THE THIRTY; ELHANAN THE SON OF DODO OF BETHLEHEM SHAMMAH OF HAROD ELIKA OF HAROD HELEZ THE PALTITE IRA THE SON OF IKKESH OF TEKOA ABIEZER OF ANATHOTH MEBUNNAI THE HUSHATHITE ZALMON THE AHOHITE MAHARAI OF NETOPHAH HELEB THE SON OF BAANAH OF NETOPHAH ITTAI THE SON OF RIBAI OF GIBEAH OF THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN BENAIAH OF PIRATHON HIDDAI OF THE BROOKS OF GAASH ABIALBON THE ARBATHITE AZMAVETH OF BAHURIM ELIAHBA THE SHAALBONITE THE SONS OF JASHEN JONATHAN SHAMMAH THE HARARITE AHIAM THE SON OF SHARAR THE HARARITE ELIPHELET THE SON OF AHASBAI OF MAACAH ELIAM THE SON OF AHITHOPHEL OF GILO HEZRO OF CARMEL PAARAI THE ARBITE IGAL THE SON OF NATHAN OF ZOBAH BANI THE GADITE ZELEK THE AMMONITE NAHARAI OF BEEROTH THE ARMORBEARER OF JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH IRA THE ITHRITE GAREB THE ITHRITE URIAH THE HITTITE THIRTYSEVEN IN ALL

AGAIN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE INCITED DAVID AGAINST THEM SAYING GO NUMBER ISRAEL AND JUDAH

 SO THE KING SAID TO JOAB THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WHO WAS WITH HIM GO THROUGH ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA AND NUMBER THE PEOPLE THAT I MAY KNOW THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE

 BUT JOAB SAID TO THE KING MAY THE LORD YOUR GOD ADD TO THE PEOPLE A HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY AS THEY ARE WHILE THE EYES OF MY LORD THE KING STILL SEE IT BUT WHY DOES MY LORD THE KING DELIGHT IN THIS THING

 BUT THE KING'S WORD PREVAILED AGAINST JOAB AND THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY

SO JOAB AND THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE KING TO NUMBER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEY CROSSED THE JORDAN AND BEGAN FROM AROER AND FROM THE CITY THAT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TOWARD GAD AND ON TO JAZER

THEN THEY CAME TO GILEAD AND TO KADESH IN THE LAND OF THE HITTITES; AND THEY CAME TO DAN AND FROM DAN THEY WENT AROUND TO SIDON AND CAME TO THE FORTRESS OF TYRE AND TO ALL THE CITIES OF THE HIVITES AND CANAANITES; AND THEY WENT OUT TO THE NEGEB OF JUDAH AT BEERSHEBA

SO WHEN THEY HAD GONE THROUGH ALL THE LAND THEY CAME TO JERUSALEM AT THE END OF NINE MONTHS AND TWENTY DAYS

AND JOAB GAVE THE SUM OF THE NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE TO THE KING IN ISRAEL THERE WERE  VALIANT MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD AND THE MEN OF JUDAH WERE 

BUT DAVID'S HEART STRUCK HIM AFTER HE HAD NUMBERED THE PEOPLE

AND DAVID SAID TO THE LORD I HAVE SINNED GREATLY IN WHAT I HAVE DONE

BUT NOW O LORD PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE INIQUITY OF YOUR SERVANT FOR I HAVE DONE VERY FOOLISHLY

 AND WHEN DAVID AROSE IN THE MORNING THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO THE PROPHET GAD DAVID'S SEER SAYING GO AND SAY TO DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THREE THINGS I OFFER YOU

CHOOSE ONE OF THEM THAT I MAY DO IT TO YOU

' SO GAD CAME TO DAVID AND TOLD HIM AND SAID TO HIM SHALL THREE YEARS OF FAMINE COME TO YOU IN YOUR LAND

OR WILL YOU FLEE THREE MONTHS BEFORE YOUR FOES WHILE THEY PURSUE YOU

OR SHALL THERE BE THREE DAYS' PESTILENCE IN YOUR LAND

NOW CONSIDER AND DECIDE WHAT ANSWER I SHALL RETURN TO HIM WHO SENT ME

 THEN DAVID SAID TO GAD I AM IN GREAT DISTRESS

LET US FALL INTO THE HAND OF THE LORD FOR HIS MERCY IS GREAT; BUT LET ME NOT FALL INTO THE HAND OF MAN

 SO THE LORD SENT A PESTILENCE ON ISRAEL FROM THE MORNING UNTIL THE APPOINTED TIME

AND THERE DIED OF THE PEOPLE FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA  MEN

AND WHEN THE ANGEL STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARD JERUSALEM TO DESTROY IT THE LORD RELENTED FROM THE CALAMITY AND SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO WAS WORKING DESTRUCTION AMONG THE PEOPLE IT IS ENOUGH; NOW STAY YOUR HAND

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WAS BY THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ARAUNAH THE JEBUSITE

THEN DAVID SPOKE TO THE LORD WHEN HE SAW THE ANGEL WHO WAS STRIKING THE PEOPLE AND SAID BEHOLD I HAVE SINNED AND I HAVE DONE WICKEDLY

BUT THESE SHEEP WHAT HAVE THEY DONE

PLEASE LET YOUR HAND BE AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY FATHER'S HOUSE

 AND GAD CAME THAT DAY TO DAVID AND SAID TO HIM GO UP RAISE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD ON THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ARAUNAH THE JEBUSITE

 SO DAVID WENT UP AT GAD'S WORD AS THE LORD COMMANDED

AND WHEN ARAUNAH LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE KING AND HIS SERVANTS COMING ON TOWARD HIM

AND ARAUNAH WENT OUT AND PAID HOMAGE TO THE KING WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND

AND ARAUNAH SAID WHY HAS MY LORD THE KING COME TO HIS SERVANT

 DAVID SAID TO BUY THE THRESHING FLOOR FROM YOU IN ORDER TO BUILD AN ALTAR TO THE LORD THAT THE PLAGUE MAY BE AVERTED FROM THE PEOPLE

 THEN ARAUNAH SAID TO DAVID LET MY LORD THE KING TAKE AND OFFER UP WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

HERE ARE THE OXEN FOR THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE THRESHING SLEDGES AND THE YOKES OF THE OXEN FOR THE WOOD

ALL THIS O KING ARAUNAH GIVES TO THE KING

 AND ARAUNAH SAID TO THE KING THE LORD YOUR GOD ACCEPT YOU

 BUT THE KING SAID TO ARAUNAH NO BUT I WILL BUY IT FROM YOU FOR A PRICE

I WILL NOT OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD MY GOD THAT COST ME NOTHING

 SO DAVID BOUGHT THE THRESHING FLOOR AND THE OXEN FOR FIFTY SHEKELS OF SILVER

AND DAVID BUILT THERE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS

SO THE LORD RESPONDED TO THE PLEA FOR THE LAND AND THE PLAGUE WAS AVERTED FROM ISRAEL

OBADIAHTHE VISION OF OBADIAH

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD CONCERNING EDOMWE HAVE HEARD A REPORT FROM THE LORDAND A MESSENGER HAS BEEN SENT AMONG THE NATIONS RISE UP

LET US RISE AGAINST HER FOR BATTLE

 BEHOLD I WILL MAKE YOU SMALL AMONG THE NATIONS; YOU SHALL BE UTTERLY DESPISED

THE PRIDE OF YOUR HEART HAS DECEIVED YOU YOU WHO LIVE IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCK IN YOUR LOFTY DWELLING WHO SAY IN YOUR HEART WHO WILL BRING ME DOWN TO THE GROUND

 THOUGH YOU SOAR ALOFT LIKE THE EAGLE THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS FROM THERE I WILL BRING YOU DOWN DECLARES THE LORD

IF THIEVES CAME TO YOU IF PLUNDERERS CAME BY NIGHTHOW YOU HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

WOULD THEY NOT STEAL ONLY ENOUGH FOR THEMSELVES

IF GRAPE GATHERERS CAME TO YOU WOULD THEY NOT LEAVE GLEANINGS

HOW ESAU HAS BEEN PILLAGED HIS TREASURES SOUGHT OUT

ALL YOUR ALLIES HAVE DRIVEN YOU TO YOUR BORDER; THOSE AT PEACE WITH YOU HAVE DECEIVED YOU; THEY HAVE PREVAILED AGAINST YOU; THOSE WHO EAT YOUR BREAD HAVE SET A TRAP BENEATH YOUYOU HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING

WILL I NOT ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD DESTROY THE WISE MEN OUT OF EDOM AND UNDERSTANDING OUT OF MOUNT ESAU

AND YOUR MIGHTY MEN SHALL BE DISMAYED O TEMAN SO THAT EVERY MAN FROM MOUNT ESAU WILL BE CUT OFF BY SLAUGHTER

BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE DONE TO YOUR BROTHER JACOB SHAME SHALL COVER YOU AND YOU SHALL BE CUT OFF FOREVER

ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD ALOOF ON THE DAY THAT STRANGERS CARRIED OFF HIS WEALTH AND FOREIGNERS ENTERED HIS GATES AND CAST LOTS FOR JERUSALEM YOU WERE LIKE ONE OF THEM

BUT DO NOT GLOAT OVER THE DAY OF YOUR BROTHER IN THE DAY OF HIS MISFORTUNE; DO NOT REJOICE OVER THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH IN THE DAY OF THEIR RUIN; DO NOT BOAST IN THE DAY OF DISTRESS

DO NOT ENTER THE GATE OF MY PEOPLE IN THE DAY OF THEIR CALAMITY; DO NOT GLOAT OVER HIS DISASTER IN THE DAY OF HIS CALAMITY; DO NOT LOOT HIS WEALTH IN THE DAY OF HIS CALAMITY

DO NOT STAND AT THE CROSSROADS TO CUT OFF HIS FUGITIVES; DO NOT HAND OVER HIS SURVIVORS IN THE DAY OF DISTRESS

FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR UPON ALL THE NATIONS

AS YOU HAVE DONE IT SHALL BE DONE TO YOU; YOUR DEEDS SHALL RETURN ON YOUR OWN HEAD

FOR AS YOU HAVE DRUNK ON MY HOLY MOUNTAIN SO ALL THE NATIONS SHALL DRINK CONTINUALLY; THEY SHALL DRINK AND SWALLOW AND SHALL BE AS THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER BEEN

BUT IN MOUNT ZION THERE SHALL BE THOSE WHO ESCAPE AND IT SHALL BE HOLY AND THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL POSSESS THEIR OWN POSSESSIONS

THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE A FIRE AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU STUBBLE; THEY SHALL BURN THEM AND CONSUME THEM AND THERE SHALL BE NO SURVIVOR FOR THE HOUSE OF ESAU FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

THOSE OF THE NEGEB SHALL POSSESS MOUNT ESAU AND THOSE OF THE SHEPHELAH SHALL POSSESS THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES; THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND OF EPHRAIM AND THE LAND OF SAMARIA AND BENJAMIN SHALL POSSESS GILEAD

THE EXILES OF THIS HOST OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL POSSESS THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES AS FAR AS ZAREPHATH AND THE EXILES OF JERUSALEM WHO ARE IN SEPHARAD SHALL POSSESS THE CITIES OF THE NEGEB

SAVIORS SHALL GO UP TO MOUNT ZION TO RULE MOUNT ESAU AND THE KINGDOM SHALL BE THE LORD'S

ESTHERNOW IN THE DAYS OF AHASUERUS THE AHASUERUS WHO REIGNED FROM INDIA TO ETHIOPIA OVER  PROVINCES IN THOSE DAYS WHEN KING AHASUERUS SAT ON HIS ROYAL THRONE IN SUSA THE CAPITAL IN THE THIRD YEAR OF HIS REIGN HE GAVE A FEAST FOR ALL HIS OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS

THE ARMY OF PERSIA AND MEDIA AND THE NOBLES AND GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCES WERE BEFORE HIM WHILE HE SHOWED THE RICHES OF HIS ROYAL GLORY AND THE SPLENDOR AND POMP OF HIS GREATNESS FOR MANY DAYS  DAYS

AND WHEN THESE DAYS WERE COMPLETED THE KING GAVE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE PRESENT IN SUSA THE CITADEL BOTH GREAT AND SMALL A FEAST LASTING FOR SEVEN DAYS IN THE COURT OF THE GARDEN OF THE KING'S PALACE

THERE WERE WHITE COTTON CURTAINS AND VIOLET HANGINGS FASTENED WITH CORDS OF FINE LINEN AND PURPLE TO SILVER RODS AND MARBLE PILLARS AND ALSO COUCHES OF GOLD AND SILVER ON A MOSAIC PAVEMENT OF PORPHYRY MARBLE MOTHEROFPEARL AND PRECIOUS STONES

DRINKS WERE SERVED IN GOLDEN VESSELS VESSELS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND THE ROYAL WINE WAS LAVISHED ACCORDING TO THE BOUNTY OF THE KING

AND DRINKING WAS ACCORDING TO THIS EDICT THERE IS NO COMPULSION

 FOR THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO ALL THE STAFF OF HIS PALACE TO DO AS EACH MAN DESIRED

QUEEN VASHTI ALSO GAVE A FEAST FOR THE WOMEN IN THE PALACE THAT BELONGED TO KING AHASUERUS

ON THE SEVENTH DAY WHEN THE HEART OF THE KING WAS MERRY WITH WINE HE COMMANDED MEHUMAN BIZTHA HARBONA BIGTHA AND ABAGTHA ZETHAR AND CARKAS THE SEVEN EUNUCHS WHO SERVED IN THE PRESENCE OF KING AHASUERUS TO BRING QUEEN VASHTI BEFORE THE KING WITH HER ROYAL CROWN IN ORDER TO SHOW THE PEOPLES AND THE PRINCES HER BEAUTY FOR SHE WAS LOVELY TO LOOK AT

BUT QUEEN VASHTI REFUSED TO COME AT THE KING'S COMMAND DELIVERED BY THE EUNUCHS

AT THIS THE KING BECAME ENRAGED AND HIS ANGER BURNED WITHIN HIM

THEN THE KING SAID TO THE WISE MEN WHO KNEW THE TIMES FOR THIS WAS THE KING'S PROCEDURE TOWARD ALL WHO WERE VERSED IN LAW AND JUDGMENT THE MEN NEXT TO HIM BEING CARSHENA SHETHAR ADMATHA TARSHISH MERES MARSENA AND MEMUCAN THE SEVEN PRINCES OF PERSIA AND MEDIA WHO SAW THE KING'S FACE AND SAT FIRST IN THE KINGDOM ACCORDING TO THE LAW WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO QUEEN VASHTI BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT PERFORMED THE COMMAND OF KING AHASUERUS DELIVERED BY THE EUNUCHS

 THEN MEMUCAN SAID IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING AND THE OFFICIALS NOT ONLY AGAINST THE KING HAS QUEEN VASHTI DONE WRONG BUT ALSO AGAINST ALL THE OFFICIALS AND ALL THE PEOPLES WHO ARE IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF KING AHASUERUS

FOR THE QUEEN'S BEHAVIOR WILL BE MADE KNOWN TO ALL WOMEN CAUSING THEM TO LOOK AT THEIR HUSBANDS WITH CONTEMPT SINCE THEY WILL SAY 'KING AHASUERUS COMMANDED QUEEN VASHTI TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SHE DID NOT COME

' THIS VERY DAY THE NOBLE WOMEN OF PERSIA AND MEDIA WHO HAVE HEARD OF THE QUEEN'S BEHAVIOR WILL SAY THE SAME TO ALL THE KING'S OFFICIALS AND THERE WILL BE CONTEMPT AND WRATH IN PLENTY

IF IT PLEASE THE KING LET A ROYAL ORDER GO OUT FROM HIM AND LET IT BE WRITTEN AMONG THE LAWS OF THE PERSIANS AND THE MEDES SO THAT IT MAY NOT BE REPEALED THAT VASHTI IS NEVER AGAIN TO COME BEFORE KING AHASUERUS

AND LET THE KING GIVE HER ROYAL POSITION TO ANOTHER WHO IS BETTER THAN SHE

SO WHEN THE DECREE MADE BY THE KING IS PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM FOR IT IS VAST ALL WOMEN WILL GIVE HONOR TO THEIR HUSBANDS HIGH AND LOW ALIKE

 THIS ADVICE PLEASED THE KING AND THE PRINCES AND THE KING DID AS MEMUCAN PROPOSED

HE SENT LETTERS TO ALL THE ROYAL PROVINCES TO EVERY PROVINCE IN ITS OWN SCRIPT AND TO EVERY PEOPLE IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE THAT EVERY MAN BE MASTER IN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD AND SPEAK ACCORDING TO THE LANGUAGE OF HIS PEOPLE

AFTER THESE THINGS WHEN THE ANGER OF KING AHASUERUS HAD ABATED HE REMEMBERED VASHTI AND WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND WHAT HAD BEEN DECREED AGAINST HER

THEN THE KING'S YOUNG MEN WHO ATTENDED HIM SAID LET BEAUTIFUL YOUNG VIRGINS BE SOUGHT OUT FOR THE KING

AND LET THE KING APPOINT OFFICERS IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF HIS KINGDOM TO GATHER ALL THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG VIRGINS TO THE HAREM IN SUSA THE CAPITAL UNDER CUSTODY OF HEGAI THE KING'S EUNUCH WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE WOMEN

LET THEIR COSMETICS BE GIVEN THEM

AND LET THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO PLEASES THE KING BE QUEEN INSTEAD OF VASHTI

 THIS PLEASED THE KING AND HE DID SO

NOW THERE WAS A JEW IN SUSA THE CITADEL WHOSE NAME WAS MORDECAI THE SON OF JAIR SON OF SHIMEI SON OF KISH A BENJAMINITE WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM JERUSALEM AMONG THE CAPTIVES CARRIED AWAY WITH JECONIAH KING OF JUDAH WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON HAD CARRIED AWAY

HE WAS BRINGING UP HADASSAH THAT IS ESTHER THE DAUGHTER OF HIS UNCLE FOR SHE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER

THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD A BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND WAS LOVELY TO LOOK AT AND WHEN HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER DIED MORDECAI TOOK HER AS HIS OWN DAUGHTER

SO WHEN THE KING'S ORDER AND HIS EDICT WERE PROCLAIMED AND WHEN MANY YOUNG WOMEN WERE GATHERED IN SUSA THE CITADEL IN CUSTODY OF HEGAI ESTHER ALSO WAS TAKEN INTO THE KING'S PALACE AND PUT IN CUSTODY OF HEGAI WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE WOMEN

AND THE YOUNG WOMAN PLEASED HIM AND WON HIS FAVOR

AND HE QUICKLY PROVIDED HER WITH HER COSMETICS AND HER PORTION OF FOOD AND WITH SEVEN CHOSEN YOUNG WOMEN FROM THE KING'S PALACE AND ADVANCED HER AND HER YOUNG WOMEN TO THE BEST PLACE IN THE HAREM

ESTHER HAD NOT MADE KNOWN HER PEOPLE OR KINDRED FOR MORDECAI HAD COMMANDED HER NOT TO MAKE IT KNOWN

AND EVERY DAY MORDECAI WALKED IN FRONT OF THE COURT OF THE HAREM TO LEARN HOW ESTHER WAS AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER

NOW WHEN THE TURN CAME FOR EACH YOUNG WOMAN TO GO IN TO KING AHASUERUS AFTER BEING TWELVE MONTHS UNDER THE REGULATIONS FOR THE WOMEN SINCE THIS WAS THE REGULAR PERIOD OF THEIR BEAUTIFYING SIX MONTHS WITH OIL OF MYRRH AND SIX MONTHS WITH SPICES AND OINTMENTS FOR WOMEN WHEN THE YOUNG WOMAN WENT IN TO THE KING IN THIS WAY SHE WAS GIVEN WHATEVER SHE DESIRED TO TAKE WITH HER FROM THE HAREM TO THE KING'S PALACE

IN THE EVENING SHE WOULD GO IN AND IN THE MORNING SHE WOULD RETURN TO THE SECOND HAREM IN CUSTODY OF SHAASHGAZ THE KING'S EUNUCH WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CONCUBINES

SHE WOULD NOT GO IN TO THE KING AGAIN UNLESS THE KING DELIGHTED IN HER AND SHE WAS SUMMONED BY NAME

WHEN THE TURN CAME FOR ESTHER THE DAUGHTER OF ABIHAIL THE UNCLE OF MORDECAI WHO HAD TAKEN HER AS HIS OWN DAUGHTER TO GO IN TO THE KING SHE ASKED FOR NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HEGAI THE KING'S EUNUCH WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE WOMEN ADVISED

NOW ESTHER WAS WINNING FAVOR IN THE EYES OF ALL WHO SAW HER

AND WHEN ESTHER WAS TAKEN TO KING AHASUERUS INTO HIS ROYAL PALACE IN THE TENTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF TEBETH IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN THE KING LOVED ESTHER MORE THAN ALL THE WOMEN AND SHE WON GRACE AND FAVOR IN HIS SIGHT MORE THAN ALL THE VIRGINS SO THAT HE SET THE ROYAL CROWN ON HER HEAD AND MADE HER QUEEN INSTEAD OF VASHTI

THEN THE KING GAVE A GREAT FEAST FOR ALL HIS OFFICIALS AND SERVANTS; IT WAS ESTHER'S FEAST

HE ALSO GRANTED A REMISSION OF TAXES TO THE PROVINCES AND GAVE GIFTS WITH ROYAL GENEROSITY

NOW WHEN THE VIRGINS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SECOND TIME MORDECAI WAS SITTING AT THE KING'S GATE

ESTHER HAD NOT MADE KNOWN HER KINDRED OR HER PEOPLE AS MORDECAI HAD COMMANDED HER FOR ESTHER OBEYED MORDECAI JUST AS WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HIM

IN THOSE DAYS AS MORDECAI WAS SITTING AT THE KING'S GATE BIGTHAN AND TERESH TWO OF THE KING'S EUNUCHS WHO GUARDED THE THRESHOLD BECAME ANGRY AND SOUGHT TO LAY HANDS ON KING AHASUERUS

AND THIS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MORDECAI AND HE TOLD IT TO QUEEN ESTHER AND ESTHER TOLD THE KING IN THE NAME OF MORDECAI

WHEN THE AFFAIR WAS INVESTIGATED AND FOUND TO BE SO THE MEN WERE BOTH HANGED ON THE GALLOWS

AND IT WAS RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING

AFTER THESE THINGS KING AHASUERUS PROMOTED HAMAN THE AGAGITE THE SON OF HAMMEDATHA AND ADVANCED HIM AND SET HIS THRONE ABOVE ALL THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND ALL THE KING'S SERVANTS WHO WERE AT THE KING'S GATE BOWED DOWN AND PAID HOMAGE TO HAMAN FOR THE KING HAD SO COMMANDED CONCERNING HIM

BUT MORDECAI DID NOT BOW DOWN OR PAY HOMAGE

THEN THE KING'S SERVANTS WHO WERE AT THE KING'S GATE SAID TO MORDECAI WHY DO YOU TRANSGRESS THE KING'S COMMAND

 AND WHEN THEY SPOKE TO HIM DAY AFTER DAY AND HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM THEY TOLD HAMAN IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER MORDECAI'S WORDS WOULD STAND FOR HE HAD TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS A JEW

AND WHEN HAMAN SAW THAT MORDECAI DID NOT BOW DOWN OR PAY HOMAGE TO HIM HAMAN WAS FILLED WITH FURY

BUT HE DISDAINED TO LAY HANDS ON MORDECAI ALONE

SO AS THEY HAD MADE KNOWN TO HIM THE PEOPLE OF MORDECAI HAMAN SOUGHT TO DESTROY ALL THE JEWS THE PEOPLE OF MORDECAI THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM OF AHASUERUS

IN THE FIRST MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF NISAN IN THE TWELFTH YEAR OF KING AHASUERUS THEY CAST PUR THAT IS THEY CAST LOTS BEFORE HAMAN DAY AFTER DAY; AND THEY CAST IT MONTH AFTER MONTH TILL THE TWELFTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF ADAR

THEN HAMAN SAID TO KING AHASUERUS THERE IS A CERTAIN PEOPLE SCATTERED ABROAD AND DISPERSED AMONG THE PEOPLES IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF YOUR KINGDOM

THEIR LAWS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF EVERY OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY DO NOT KEEP THE KING'S LAWS SO THAT IT IS NOT TO THE KING'S PROFIT TO TOLERATE THEM

IF IT PLEASE THE KING LET IT BE DECREED THAT THEY BE DESTROYED AND I WILL PAY  TALENTS OF SILVER INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE CHARGE OF THE KING'S BUSINESS THAT THEY MAY PUT IT INTO THE KING'S TREASURIES

 SO THE KING TOOK HIS SIGNET RING FROM HIS HAND AND GAVE IT TO HAMAN THE AGAGITE THE SON OF HAMMEDATHA THE ENEMY OF THE JEWS

AND THE KING SAID TO HAMAN THE MONEY IS GIVEN TO YOU THE PEOPLE ALSO TO DO WITH THEM AS IT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

 THEN THE KING'S SCRIBES WERE SUMMONED ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH AND AN EDICT ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HAMAN COMMANDED WAS WRITTEN TO THE KING'S SATRAPS AND TO THE GOVERNORS OVER ALL THE PROVINCES AND TO THE OFFICIALS OF ALL THE PEOPLES TO EVERY PROVINCE IN ITS OWN SCRIPT AND EVERY PEOPLE IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE

IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE NAME OF KING AHASUERUS AND SEALED WITH THE KING'S SIGNET RING

LETTERS WERE SENT BY COURIERS TO ALL THE KING'S PROVINCES WITH INSTRUCTION TO DESTROY TO KILL AND TO ANNIHILATE ALL JEWS YOUNG AND OLD WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN ONE DAY THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE TWELFTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF ADAR AND TO PLUNDER THEIR GOODS

A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED AS A DECREE IN EVERY PROVINCE BY PROCLAMATION TO ALL THE PEOPLES TO BE READY FOR THAT DAY

THE COURIERS WENT OUT HURRIEDLY BY ORDER OF THE KING AND THE DECREE WAS ISSUED IN SUSA THE CITADEL

AND THE KING AND HAMAN SAT DOWN TO DRINK BUT THE CITY OF SUSA WAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION

WHEN MORDECAI LEARNED ALL THAT HAD BEEN DONE MORDECAI TORE HIS CLOTHES AND PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND ASHES AND WENT OUT INTO THE MIDST OF THE CITY AND HE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD AND BITTER CRY

HE WENT UP TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING'S GATE FOR NO ONE WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE KING'S GATE CLOTHED IN SACKCLOTH

AND IN EVERY PROVINCE WHEREVER THE KING'S COMMAND AND HIS DECREE REACHED THERE WAS GREAT MOURNING AMONG THE JEWS WITH FASTING AND WEEPING AND LAMENTING AND MANY OF THEM LAY IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES

WHEN ESTHER'S YOUNG WOMEN AND HER EUNUCHS CAME AND TOLD HER THE QUEEN WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED

SHE SENT GARMENTS TO CLOTHE MORDECAI SO THAT HE MIGHT TAKE OFF HIS SACKCLOTH BUT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM

THEN ESTHER CALLED FOR HATHACH ONE OF THE KING'S EUNUCHS WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO ATTEND HER AND ORDERED HIM TO GO TO MORDECAI TO LEARN WHAT THIS WAS AND WHY IT WAS

HATHACH WENT OUT TO MORDECAI IN THE OPEN SQUARE OF THE CITY IN FRONT OF THE KING'S GATE AND MORDECAI TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THE EXACT SUM OF MONEY THAT HAMAN HAD PROMISED TO PAY INTO THE KING'S TREASURIES FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE JEWS

MORDECAI ALSO GAVE HIM A COPY OF THE WRITTEN DECREE ISSUED IN SUSA FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION THAT HE MIGHT SHOW IT TO ESTHER AND EXPLAIN IT TO HER AND COMMAND HER TO GO TO THE KING TO BEG HIS FAVOR AND PLEAD WITH HIM ON BEHALF OF HER PEOPLE

AND HATHACH WENT AND TOLD ESTHER WHAT MORDECAI HAD SAID

THEN ESTHER SPOKE TO HATHACH AND COMMANDED HIM TO GO TO MORDECAI AND SAY ALL THE KING'S SERVANTS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE KING'S PROVINCES KNOW THAT IF ANY MAN OR WOMAN GOES TO THE KING INSIDE THE INNER COURT WITHOUT BEING CALLED THERE IS BUT ONE LAWTO BE PUT TO DEATH EXCEPT THE ONE TO WHOM THE KING HOLDS OUT THE GOLDEN SCEPTER SO THAT HE MAY LIVE

BUT AS FOR ME I HAVE NOT BEEN CALLED TO COME IN TO THE KING THESE THIRTY DAYS

 AND THEY TOLD MORDECAI WHAT ESTHER HAD SAID

THEN MORDECAI TOLD THEM TO REPLY TO ESTHER DO NOT THINK TO YOURSELF THAT IN THE KING'S PALACE YOU WILL ESCAPE ANY MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER JEWS

FOR IF YOU KEEP SILENT AT THIS TIME RELIEF AND DELIVERANCE WILL RISE FOR THE JEWS FROM ANOTHER PLACE BUT YOU AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE WILL PERISH

AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER YOU HAVE NOT COME TO THE KINGDOM FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS

 THEN ESTHER TOLD THEM TO REPLY TO MORDECAI GO GATHER ALL THE JEWS TO BE FOUND IN SUSA AND HOLD A FAST ON MY BEHALF AND DO NOT EAT OR DRINK FOR THREE DAYS NIGHT OR DAY

I AND MY YOUNG WOMEN WILL ALSO FAST AS YOU DO

THEN I WILL GO TO THE KING THOUGH IT IS AGAINST THE LAW AND IF I PERISH I PERISH

 MORDECAI THEN WENT AWAY AND DID EVERYTHING AS ESTHER HAD ORDERED HIM

ON THE THIRD DAY ESTHER PUT ON HER ROYAL ROBES AND STOOD IN THE INNER COURT OF THE KING'S PALACE IN FRONT OF THE KING'S QUARTERS WHILE THE KING WAS SITTING ON HIS ROYAL THRONE INSIDE THE THRONE ROOM OPPOSITE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE

AND WHEN THE KING SAW QUEEN ESTHER STANDING IN THE COURT SHE WON FAVOR IN HIS SIGHT AND HE HELD OUT TO ESTHER THE GOLDEN SCEPTER THAT WAS IN HIS HAND

THEN ESTHER APPROACHED AND TOUCHED THE TIP OF THE SCEPTER

AND THE KING SAID TO HER WHAT IS IT QUEEN ESTHER

WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST

IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU EVEN TO THE HALF OF MY KINGDOM

 AND ESTHER SAID IF IT PLEASE THE KING LET THE KING AND HAMAN COME TODAY TO A FEAST THAT I HAVE PREPARED FOR THE KING

 THEN THE KING SAID BRING HAMAN QUICKLY SO THAT WE MAY DO AS ESTHER HAS ASKED

 SO THE KING AND HAMAN CAME TO THE FEAST THAT ESTHER HAD PREPARED

AND AS THEY WERE DRINKING WINE AFTER THE FEAST THE KING SAID TO ESTHER WHAT IS YOUR WISH

IT SHALL BE GRANTED YOU

AND WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST

EVEN TO THE HALF OF MY KINGDOM IT SHALL BE FULFILLED

 THEN ESTHER ANSWERED MY WISH AND MY REQUEST IS IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE KING AND IF IT PLEASE THE KING TO GRANT MY WISH AND FULFILL MY REQUEST LET THE KING AND HAMAN COME TO THE FEAST THAT I WILL PREPARE FOR THEM AND TOMORROW I WILL DO AS THE KING HAS SAID

 AND HAMAN WENT OUT THAT DAY JOYFUL AND GLAD OF HEART

BUT WHEN HAMAN SAW MORDECAI IN THE KING'S GATE THAT HE NEITHER ROSE NOR TREMBLED BEFORE HIM HE WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AGAINST MORDECAI

NEVERTHELESS HAMAN RESTRAINED HIMSELF AND WENT HOME AND HE SENT AND BROUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND HIS WIFE ZERESH

AND HAMAN RECOUNTED TO THEM THE SPLENDOR OF HIS RICHES THE NUMBER OF HIS SONS ALL THE PROMOTIONS WITH WHICH THE KING HAD HONORED HIM AND HOW HE HAD ADVANCED HIM ABOVE THE OFFICIALS AND THE SERVANTS OF THE KING

THEN HAMAN SAID EVEN QUEEN ESTHER LET NO ONE BUT ME COME WITH THE KING TO THE FEAST SHE PREPARED

AND TOMORROW ALSO I AM INVITED BY HER TOGETHER WITH THE KING

YET ALL THIS IS WORTH NOTHING TO ME SO LONG AS I SEE MORDECAI THE JEW SITTING AT THE KING'S GATE

 THEN HIS WIFE ZERESH AND ALL HIS FRIENDS SAID TO HIM LET A GALLOWS FIFTY CUBITS HIGH BE MADE AND IN THE MORNING TELL THE KING TO HAVE MORDECAI HANGED UPON IT

THEN GO JOYFULLY WITH THE KING TO THE FEAST

 THIS IDEA PLEASED HAMAN AND HE HAD THE GALLOWS MADE

ON THAT NIGHT THE KING COULD NOT SLEEP

AND HE GAVE ORDERS TO BRING THE BOOK OF MEMORABLE DEEDS THE CHRONICLES AND THEY WERE READ BEFORE THE KING

AND IT WAS FOUND WRITTEN HOW MORDECAI HAD TOLD ABOUT BIGTHANA AND TERESH TWO OF THE KING'S EUNUCHS WHO GUARDED THE THRESHOLD AND WHO HAD SOUGHT TO LAY HANDS ON KING AHASUERUS

AND THE KING SAID WHAT HONOR OR DISTINCTION HAS BEEN BESTOWED ON MORDECAI FOR THIS

 THE KING'S YOUNG MEN WHO ATTENDED HIM SAID NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOR HIM

 AND THE KING SAID WHO IS IN THE COURT

 NOW HAMAN HAD JUST ENTERED THE OUTER COURT OF THE KING'S PALACE TO SPEAK TO THE KING ABOUT HAVING MORDECAI HANGED ON THE GALLOWS THAT HE HAD PREPARED FOR HIM

AND THE KING'S YOUNG MEN TOLD HIM HAMAN IS THERE STANDING IN THE COURT

 AND THE KING SAID LET HIM COME IN

 SO HAMAN CAME IN AND THE KING SAID TO HIM WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO THE MAN WHOM THE KING DELIGHTS TO HONOR

 AND HAMAN SAID TO HIMSELF WHOM WOULD THE KING DELIGHT TO HONOR MORE THAN ME

 AND HAMAN SAID TO THE KING FOR THE MAN WHOM THE KING DELIGHTS TO HONOR LET ROYAL ROBES BE BROUGHT WHICH THE KING HAS WORN AND THE HORSE THAT THE KING HAS RIDDEN AND ON WHOSE HEAD A ROYAL CROWN IS SET

AND LET THE ROBES AND THE HORSE BE HANDED OVER TO ONE OF THE KING'S MOST NOBLE OFFICIALS

LET THEM DRESS THE MAN WHOM THE KING DELIGHTS TO HONOR AND LET THEM LEAD HIM ON THE HORSE THROUGH THE SQUARE OF THE CITY PROCLAIMING BEFORE HIM 'THUS SHALL IT BE DONE TO THE MAN WHOM THE KING DELIGHTS TO HONOR

' THEN THE KING SAID TO HAMAN HURRY; TAKE THE ROBES AND THE HORSE AS YOU HAVE SAID AND DO SO TO MORDECAI THE JEW WHO SITS AT THE KING'S GATE

LEAVE OUT NOTHING THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED

 SO HAMAN TOOK THE ROBES AND THE HORSE AND HE DRESSED MORDECAI AND LED HIM THROUGH THE SQUARE OF THE CITY PROCLAIMING BEFORE HIM THUS SHALL IT BE DONE TO THE MAN WHOM THE KING DELIGHTS TO HONOR

 THEN MORDECAI RETURNED TO THE KING'S GATE

BUT HAMAN HURRIED TO HIS HOUSE MOURNING AND WITH HIS HEAD COVERED

AND HAMAN TOLD HIS WIFE ZERESH AND ALL HIS FRIENDS EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM

THEN HIS WISE MEN AND HIS WIFE ZERESH SAID TO HIM IF MORDECAI BEFORE WHOM YOU HAVE BEGUN TO FALL IS OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE YOU WILL NOT OVERCOME HIM BUT WILL SURELY FALL BEFORE HIM

 WHILE THEY WERE YET TALKING WITH HIM THE KING'S EUNUCHS ARRIVED AND HURRIED TO BRING HAMAN TO THE FEAST THAT ESTHER HAD PREPARED

SO THE KING AND HAMAN WENT IN TO FEAST WITH QUEEN ESTHER

AND ON THE SECOND DAY AS THEY WERE DRINKING WINE AFTER THE FEAST THE KING AGAIN SAID TO ESTHER WHAT IS YOUR WISH QUEEN ESTHER

IT SHALL BE GRANTED YOU

AND WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST

EVEN TO THE HALF OF MY KINGDOM IT SHALL BE FULFILLED

 THEN QUEEN ESTHER ANSWERED IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT O KING AND IF IT PLEASE THE KING LET MY LIFE BE GRANTED ME FOR MY WISH AND MY PEOPLE FOR MY REQUEST

FOR WE HAVE BEEN SOLD I AND MY PEOPLE TO BE DESTROYED TO BE KILLED AND TO BE ANNIHILATED

IF WE HAD BEEN SOLD MERELY AS SLAVES MEN AND WOMEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR OUR AFFLICTION IS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE LOSS TO THE KING

 THEN KING AHASUERUS SAID TO QUEEN ESTHER WHO IS HE AND WHERE IS HE WHO HAS DARED TO DO THIS

 AND ESTHER SAID A FOE AND ENEMY

THIS WICKED HAMAN

 THEN HAMAN WAS TERRIFIED BEFORE THE KING AND THE QUEEN

AND THE KING AROSE IN HIS WRATH FROM THE WINEDRINKING AND WENT INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BUT HAMAN STAYED TO BEG FOR HIS LIFE FROM QUEEN ESTHER FOR HE SAW THAT HARM WAS DETERMINED AGAINST HIM BY THE KING

AND THE KING RETURNED FROM THE PALACE GARDEN TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE DRINKING WINE AS HAMAN WAS FALLING ON THE COUCH WHERE ESTHER WAS

AND THE KING SAID WILL HE EVEN ASSAULT THE QUEEN IN MY PRESENCE IN MY OWN HOUSE

 AS THE WORD LEFT THE MOUTH OF THE KING THEY COVERED HAMAN'S FACE

THEN HARBONA ONE OF THE EUNUCHS IN ATTENDANCE ON THE KING SAID MOREOVER THE GALLOWS THAT HAMAN HAS PREPARED FOR MORDECAI WHOSE WORD SAVED THE KING IS STANDING AT HAMAN'S HOUSE FIFTY CUBITS HIGH

 AND THE KING SAID HANG HIM ON THAT

 SO THEY HANGED HAMAN ON THE GALLOWS THAT HE HAD PREPARED FOR MORDECAI

THEN THE WRATH OF THE KING ABATED

ON THAT DAY KING AHASUERUS GAVE TO QUEEN ESTHER THE HOUSE OF HAMAN THE ENEMY OF THE JEWS

AND MORDECAI CAME BEFORE THE KING FOR ESTHER HAD TOLD WHAT HE WAS TO HER

AND THE KING TOOK OFF HIS SIGNET RING WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HAMAN AND GAVE IT TO MORDECAI

AND ESTHER SET MORDECAI OVER THE HOUSE OF HAMAN

THEN ESTHER SPOKE AGAIN TO THE KING

SHE FELL AT HIS FEET AND WEPT AND PLEADED WITH HIM TO AVERT THE EVIL PLAN OF HAMAN THE AGAGITE AND THE PLOT THAT HE HAD DEVISED AGAINST THE JEWS

WHEN THE KING HELD OUT THE GOLDEN SCEPTER TO ESTHER ESTHER ROSE AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING

AND SHE SAID IF IT PLEASE THE KING AND IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN HIS SIGHT AND IF THE THING SEEMS RIGHT BEFORE THE KING AND I AM PLEASING IN HIS EYES LET AN ORDER BE WRITTEN TO REVOKE THE LETTERS DEVISED BY HAMAN THE AGAGITE THE SON OF HAMMEDATHA WHICH HE WROTE TO DESTROY THE JEWS WHO ARE IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF THE KING

FOR HOW CAN I BEAR TO SEE THE CALAMITY THAT IS COMING TO MY PEOPLE

OR HOW CAN I BEAR TO SEE THE DESTRUCTION OF MY KINDRED

 THEN KING AHASUERUS SAID TO QUEEN ESTHER AND TO MORDECAI THE JEW BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN ESTHER THE HOUSE OF HAMAN AND THEY HAVE HANGED HIM ON THE GALLOWS BECAUSE HE INTENDED TO LAY HANDS ON THE JEWS

BUT YOU MAY WRITE AS YOU PLEASE WITH REGARD TO THE JEWS IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND SEAL IT WITH THE KING'S RING FOR AN EDICT WRITTEN IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND SEALED WITH THE KING'S RING CANNOT BE REVOKED

 THE KING'S SCRIBES WERE SUMMONED AT THAT TIME IN THE THIRD MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF SIVAN ON THE TWENTYTHIRD DAY

AND AN EDICT WAS WRITTEN ACCORDING TO ALL THAT MORDECAI COMMANDED CONCERNING THE JEWS TO THE SATRAPS AND THE GOVERNORS AND THE OFFICIALS OF THE PROVINCES FROM INDIA TO ETHIOPIA  PROVINCES TO EACH PROVINCE IN ITS OWN SCRIPT AND TO EACH PEOPLE IN ITS OWN LANGUAGE AND ALSO TO THE JEWS IN THEIR SCRIPT AND THEIR LANGUAGE

AND HE WROTE IN THE NAME OF KING AHASUERUS AND SEALED IT WITH THE KING'S SIGNET RING

THEN HE SENT THE LETTERS BY MOUNTED COURIERS RIDING ON SWIFT HORSES THAT WERE USED IN THE KING'S SERVICE BRED FROM THE ROYAL STUD SAYING THAT THE KING ALLOWED THE JEWS WHO WERE IN EVERY CITY TO GATHER AND DEFEND THEIR LIVES TO DESTROY TO KILL AND TO ANNIHILATE ANY ARMED FORCE OF ANY PEOPLE OR PROVINCE THAT MIGHT ATTACK THEM CHILDREN AND WOMEN INCLUDED AND TO PLUNDER THEIR GOODS ON ONE DAY THROUGHOUT ALL THE PROVINCES OF KING AHASUERUS ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE TWELFTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF ADAR

A COPY OF WHAT WAS WRITTEN WAS TO BE ISSUED AS A DECREE IN EVERY PROVINCE BEING PUBLICLY DISPLAYED TO ALL PEOPLES AND THE JEWS WERE TO BE READY ON THAT DAY TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON THEIR ENEMIES

SO THE COURIERS MOUNTED ON THEIR SWIFT HORSES THAT WERE USED IN THE KING'S SERVICE RODE OUT HURRIEDLY URGED BY THE KING'S COMMAND

AND THE DECREE WAS ISSUED IN SUSA THE CITADEL

THEN MORDECAI WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE KING IN ROYAL ROBES OF BLUE AND WHITE WITH A GREAT GOLDEN CROWN AND A ROBE OF FINE LINEN AND PURPLE AND THE CITY OF SUSA SHOUTED AND REJOICED

THE JEWS HAD LIGHT AND GLADNESS AND JOY AND HONOR

AND IN EVERY PROVINCE AND IN EVERY CITY WHEREVER THE KING'S COMMAND AND HIS EDICT REACHED THERE WAS GLADNESS AND JOY AMONG THE JEWS A FEAST AND A HOLIDAY

AND MANY FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE COUNTRY DECLARED THEMSELVES JEWS FOR FEAR OF THE JEWS HAD FALLEN ON THEM

NOW IN THE TWELFTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF ADAR ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE SAME WHEN THE KING'S COMMAND AND EDICT WERE ABOUT TO BE CARRIED OUT ON THE VERY DAY WHEN THE ENEMIES OF THE JEWS HOPED TO GAIN THE MASTERY OVER THEM THE REVERSE OCCURRED THE JEWS GAINED MASTERY OVER THOSE WHO HATED THEM

THE JEWS GATHERED IN THEIR CITIES THROUGHOUT ALL THE PROVINCES OF KING AHASUERUS TO LAY HANDS ON THOSE WHO SOUGHT THEIR HARM

AND NO ONE COULD STAND AGAINST THEM FOR THE FEAR OF THEM HAD FALLEN ON ALL PEOPLES

ALL THE OFFICIALS OF THE PROVINCES AND THE SATRAPS AND THE GOVERNORS AND THE ROYAL AGENTS ALSO HELPED THE JEWS FOR THE FEAR OF MORDECAI HAD FALLEN ON THEM

FOR MORDECAI WAS GREAT IN THE KING'S HOUSE AND HIS FAME SPREAD THROUGHOUT ALL THE PROVINCES FOR THE MAN MORDECAI GREW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL

THE JEWS STRUCK ALL THEIR ENEMIES WITH THE SWORD KILLING AND DESTROYING THEM AND DID AS THEY PLEASED TO THOSE WHO HATED THEM

IN SUSA THE CITADEL ITSELF THE JEWS KILLED AND DESTROYED  MEN AND ALSO KILLED PARSHANDATHA AND DALPHON AND ASPATHA AND PORATHA AND ADALIA AND ARIDATHA AND PARMASHTA AND ARISAI AND ARIDAI AND VAIZATHA THE TEN SONS OF HAMAN THE SON OF HAMMEDATHA THE ENEMY OF THE JEWS BUT THEY LAID NO HAND ON THE PLUNDER

THAT VERY DAY THE NUMBER OF THOSE KILLED IN SUSA THE CITADEL WAS REPORTED TO THE KING

AND THE KING SAID TO QUEEN ESTHER IN SUSA THE CITADEL THE JEWS HAVE KILLED AND DESTROYED  MEN AND ALSO THE TEN SONS OF HAMAN

WHAT THEN HAVE THEY DONE IN THE REST OF THE KING'S PROVINCES

NOW WHAT IS YOUR WISH

IT SHALL BE GRANTED YOU

AND WHAT FURTHER IS YOUR REQUEST

IT SHALL BE FULFILLED

 AND ESTHER SAID IF IT PLEASE THE KING LET THE JEWS WHO ARE IN SUSA BE ALLOWED TOMORROW ALSO TO DO ACCORDING TO THIS DAY'S EDICT

AND LET THE TEN SONS OF HAMAN BE HANGED ON THE GALLOWS

 SO THE KING COMMANDED THIS TO BE DONE

A DECREE WAS ISSUED IN SUSA AND THE TEN SONS OF HAMAN WERE HANGED

THE JEWS WHO WERE IN SUSA GATHERED ALSO ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH OF ADAR AND THEY KILLED  MEN IN SUSA BUT THEY LAID NO HANDS ON THE PLUNDER

NOW THE REST OF THE JEWS WHO WERE IN THE KING'S PROVINCES ALSO GATHERED TO DEFEND THEIR LIVES AND GOT RELIEF FROM THEIR ENEMIES AND KILLED  OF THOSE WHO HATED THEM BUT THEY LAID NO HANDS ON THE PLUNDER

THIS WAS ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH OF ADAR AND ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY THEY RESTED AND MADE THAT A DAY OF FEASTING AND GLADNESS

BUT THE JEWS WHO WERE IN SUSA GATHERED ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY AND ON THE FOURTEENTH AND RESTED ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY MAKING THAT A DAY OF FEASTING AND GLADNESS

THEREFORE THE JEWS OF THE VILLAGES WHO LIVE IN THE RURAL TOWNS HOLD THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH OF ADAR AS A DAY FOR GLADNESS AND FEASTING AS A HOLIDAY AND AS A DAY ON WHICH THEY SEND GIFTS OF FOOD TO ONE ANOTHER

AND MORDECAI RECORDED THESE THINGS AND SENT LETTERS TO ALL THE JEWS WHO WERE IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF KING AHASUERUS BOTH NEAR AND FAR OBLIGING THEM TO KEEP THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH ADAR AND ALSO THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SAME YEAR BY YEAR AS THE DAYS ON WHICH THE JEWS GOT RELIEF FROM THEIR ENEMIES AND AS THE MONTH THAT HAD BEEN TURNED FOR THEM FROM SORROW INTO GLADNESS AND FROM MOURNING INTO A HOLIDAY; THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE THEM DAYS OF FEASTING AND GLADNESS DAYS FOR SENDING GIFTS OF FOOD TO ONE ANOTHER AND GIFTS TO THE POOR

SO THE JEWS ACCEPTED WHAT THEY HAD STARTED TO DO AND WHAT MORDECAI HAD WRITTEN TO THEM

FOR HAMAN THE AGAGITE THE SON OF HAMMEDATHA THE ENEMY OF ALL THE JEWS HAD PLOTTED AGAINST THE JEWS TO DESTROY THEM AND HAD CAST PUR THAT IS CAST LOTS TO CRUSH AND TO DESTROY THEM

BUT WHEN IT CAME BEFORE THE KING HE GAVE ORDERS IN WRITING THAT HIS EVIL PLAN THAT HE HAD DEVISED AGAINST THE JEWS SHOULD RETURN ON HIS OWN HEAD AND THAT HE AND HIS SONS SHOULD BE HANGED ON THE GALLOWS

THEREFORE THEY CALLED THESE DAYS PURIM AFTER THE TERM PUR

THEREFORE BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN IN THIS LETTER AND OF WHAT THEY HAD FACED IN THIS MATTER AND OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM THE JEWS FIRMLY OBLIGATED THEMSELVES AND THEIR OFFSPRING AND ALL WHO JOINED THEM THAT WITHOUT FAIL THEY WOULD KEEP THESE TWO DAYS ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND AT THE TIME APPOINTED EVERY YEAR THAT THESE DAYS SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AND KEPT THROUGHOUT EVERY GENERATION IN EVERY CLAN PROVINCE AND CITY AND THAT THESE DAYS OF PURIM SHOULD NEVER FALL INTO DISUSE AMONG THE JEWS NOR SHOULD THE COMMEMORATION OF THESE DAYS CEASE AMONG THEIR DESCENDANTS

THEN QUEEN ESTHER THE DAUGHTER OF ABIHAIL AND MORDECAI THE JEW GAVE FULL WRITTEN AUTHORITY CONFIRMING THIS SECOND LETTER ABOUT PURIM

LETTERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE JEWS TO THE  PROVINCES OF THE KINGDOM OF AHASUERUS IN WORDS OF PEACE AND TRUTH THAT THESE DAYS OF PURIM SHOULD BE OBSERVED AT THEIR APPOINTED SEASONS AS MORDECAI THE JEW AND QUEEN ESTHER OBLIGATED THEM AND AS THEY HAD OBLIGATED THEMSELVES AND THEIR OFFSPRING WITH REGARD TO THEIR FASTS AND THEIR LAMENTING

THE COMMAND OF QUEEN ESTHER CONFIRMED THESE PRACTICES OF PURIM AND IT WAS RECORDED IN WRITING

KING AHASUERUS IMPOSED TAX ON THE LAND AND ON THE COASTLANDS OF THE SEA

AND ALL THE ACTS OF HIS POWER AND MIGHT AND THE FULL ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH HONOR OF MORDECAI TO WHICH THE KING ADVANCED HIM ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF MEDIA AND PERSIA

FOR MORDECAI THE JEW WAS SECOND IN RANK TO KING AHASUERUS AND HE WAS GREAT AMONG THE JEWS AND POPULAR WITH THE MULTITUDE OF HIS BROTHERS FOR HE SOUGHT THE WELFARE OF HIS PEOPLE AND SPOKE PEACE TO ALL HIS PEOPLE

EXODUSTHESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL WHO CAME TO EGYPT WITH JACOB EACH WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD REUBEN SIMEON LEVI AND JUDAH ISSACHAR ZEBULUN AND BENJAMIN DAN AND NAPHTALI GAD AND ASHER

ALL THE DESCENDANTS OF JACOB WERE SEVENTY PERSONS; JOSEPH WAS ALREADY IN EGYPT

THEN JOSEPH DIED AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND ALL THAT GENERATION

BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE FRUITFUL AND INCREASED GREATLY; THEY MULTIPLIED AND GREW EXCEEDINGLY STRONG SO THAT THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM

NOW THERE AROSE A NEW KING OVER EGYPT WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH

AND HE SAID TO HIS PEOPLE BEHOLD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ARE TOO MANY AND TOO MIGHTY FOR US

COME LET US DEAL SHREWDLY WITH THEM LEST THEY MULTIPLY AND IF WAR BREAKS OUT THEY JOIN OUR ENEMIES AND FIGHT AGAINST US AND ESCAPE FROM THE LAND

 THEREFORE THEY SET TASKMASTERS OVER THEM TO AFFLICT THEM WITH HEAVY BURDENS

THEY BUILT FOR PHARAOH STORE CITIES PITHOM AND RAAMSES

BUT THE MORE THEY WERE OPPRESSED THE MORE THEY MULTIPLIED AND THE MORE THEY SPREAD ABROAD

AND THE EGYPTIANS WERE IN DREAD OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

SO THEY RUTHLESSLY MADE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WORK AS SLAVES AND MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER WITH HARD SERVICE IN MORTAR AND BRICK AND IN ALL KINDS OF WORK IN THE FIELD

IN ALL THEIR WORK THEY RUTHLESSLY MADE THEM WORK AS SLAVES

THEN THE KING OF EGYPT SAID TO THE HEBREW MIDWIVES ONE OF WHOM WAS NAMED SHIPHRAH AND THE OTHER PUAH WHEN YOU SERVE AS MIDWIFE TO THE HEBREW WOMEN AND SEE THEM ON THE BIRTHSTOOL IF IT IS A SON YOU SHALL KILL HIM BUT IF IT IS A DAUGHTER SHE SHALL LIVE

 BUT THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD AND DID NOT DO AS THE KING OF EGYPT COMMANDED THEM BUT LET THE MALE CHILDREN LIVE

SO THE KING OF EGYPT CALLED THE MIDWIVES AND SAID TO THEM WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS AND LET THE MALE CHILDREN LIVE

 THE MIDWIVES SAID TO PHARAOH BECAUSE THE HEBREW WOMEN ARE NOT LIKE THE EGYPTIAN WOMEN FOR THEY ARE VIGOROUS AND GIVE BIRTH BEFORE THE MIDWIFE COMES TO THEM

 SO GOD DEALT WELL WITH THE MIDWIVES

AND THE PEOPLE MULTIPLIED AND GREW VERY STRONG

AND BECAUSE THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD HE GAVE THEM FAMILIES

THEN PHARAOH COMMANDED ALL HIS PEOPLE EVERY SON THAT IS BORN TO THE HEBREWS YOU SHALL CAST INTO THE NILE BUT YOU SHALL LET EVERY DAUGHTER LIVE

NOW A MAN FROM THE HOUSE OF LEVI WENT AND TOOK AS HIS WIFE A LEVITE WOMAN

THE WOMAN CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE WAS A FINE CHILD SHE HID HIM THREE MONTHS

WHEN SHE COULD HIDE HIM NO LONGER SHE TOOK FOR HIM A BASKET MADE OF BULRUSHES AND DAUBED IT WITH BITUMEN AND PITCH

SHE PUT THE CHILD IN IT AND PLACED IT AMONG THE REEDS BY THE RIVER BANK

AND HIS SISTER STOOD AT A DISTANCE TO KNOW WHAT WOULD BE DONE TO HIM

NOW THE DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH CAME DOWN TO BATHE AT THE RIVER WHILE HER YOUNG WOMEN WALKED BESIDE THE RIVER

SHE SAW THE BASKET AMONG THE REEDS AND SENT HER SERVANT WOMAN AND SHE TOOK IT

WHEN SHE OPENED IT SHE SAW THE CHILD AND BEHOLD THE BABY WAS CRYING

SHE TOOK PITY ON HIM AND SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE HEBREWS' CHILDREN

 THEN HIS SISTER SAID TO PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER SHALL I GO AND CALL YOU A NURSE FROM THE HEBREW WOMEN TO NURSE THE CHILD FOR YOU

 AND PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER SAID TO HER GO

 SO THE GIRL WENT AND CALLED THE CHILD'S MOTHER

AND PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER SAID TO HER TAKE THIS CHILD AWAY AND NURSE HIM FOR ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR WAGES

 SO THE WOMAN TOOK THE CHILD AND NURSED HIM

WHEN THE CHILD GREW UP SHE BROUGHT HIM TO PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER AND HE BECAME HER SON

SHE NAMED HIM MOSES BECAUSE SHE SAID I DREW HIM OUT OF THE WATER

 ONE DAY WHEN MOSES HAD GROWN UP HE WENT OUT TO HIS PEOPLE AND LOOKED ON THEIR BURDENS AND HE SAW AN EGYPTIAN BEATING A HEBREW ONE OF HIS PEOPLE

HE LOOKED THIS WAY AND THAT AND SEEING NO ONE HE STRUCK DOWN THE EGYPTIAN AND HID HIM IN THE SAND

WHEN HE WENT OUT THE NEXT DAY BEHOLD TWO HEBREWS WERE STRUGGLING TOGETHER

AND HE SAID TO THE MAN IN THE WRONG WHY DO YOU STRIKE YOUR COMPANION

 HE ANSWERED WHO MADE YOU A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US

DO YOU MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN

 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND THOUGHT SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN

 WHEN PHARAOH HEARD OF IT HE SOUGHT TO KILL MOSES

BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH AND STAYED IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN

AND HE SAT DOWN BY A WELL

NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS AND THEY CAME AND DREW WATER AND FILLED THE TROUGHS TO WATER THEIR FATHER'S FLOCK

THE SHEPHERDS CAME AND DROVE THEM AWAY BUT MOSES STOOD UP AND SAVED THEM AND WATERED THEIR FLOCK

WHEN THEY CAME HOME TO THEIR FATHER REUEL HE SAID HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAVE COME HOME SO SOON TODAY

 THEY SAID AN EGYPTIAN DELIVERED US OUT OF THE HAND OF THE SHEPHERDS AND EVEN DREW WATER FOR US AND WATERED THE FLOCK

 HE SAID TO HIS DAUGHTERS THEN WHERE IS HE

WHY HAVE YOU LEFT THE MAN

CALL HIM THAT HE MAY EAT BREAD

 AND MOSES WAS CONTENT TO DWELL WITH THE MAN AND HE GAVE MOSES HIS DAUGHTER ZIPPORAH

SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON AND HE CALLED HIS NAME GERSHOM FOR HE SAID I HAVE BEEN A SOJOURNER IN A FOREIGN LAND

 DURING THOSE MANY DAYS THE KING OF EGYPT DIED AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GROANED BECAUSE OF THEIR SLAVERY AND CRIED OUT FOR HELP

THEIR CRY FOR RESCUE FROM SLAVERY CAME UP TO GOD

AND GOD HEARD THEIR GROANING AND GOD REMEMBERED HIS COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM WITH ISAAC AND WITH JACOB

GOD SAW THE PEOPLE OF ISRAELAND GOD KNEW

NOW MOSES WAS KEEPING THE FLOCK OF HIS FATHERINLAW JETHRO THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN AND HE LED HIS FLOCK TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE WILDERNESS AND CAME TO HOREB THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM IN A FLAME OF FIRE OUT OF THE MIDST OF A BUSH

HE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE BUSH WAS BURNING YET IT WAS NOT CONSUMED

AND MOSES SAID I WILL TURN ASIDE TO SEE THIS GREAT SIGHT WHY THE BUSH IS NOT BURNED

 WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT HE TURNED ASIDE TO SEE GOD CALLED TO HIM OUT OF THE BUSH MOSES MOSES

 AND HE SAID HERE I AM

 THEN HE SAID DO NOT COME NEAR; TAKE YOUR SANDALS OFF YOUR FEET FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND

 AND HE SAID I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER THE GOD OF ABRAHAM THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB

 AND MOSES HID HIS FACE FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT GOD

THEN THE LORD SAID I HAVE SURELY SEEN THE AFFLICTION OF MY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR CRY BECAUSE OF THEIR TASKMASTERS

I KNOW THEIR SUFFERINGS AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP OUT OF THAT LAND TO A GOOD AND BROAD LAND A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY TO THE PLACE OF THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES

AND NOW BEHOLD THE CRY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAS COME TO ME AND I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE OPPRESSION WITH WHICH THE EGYPTIANS OPPRESS THEM

COME I WILL SEND YOU TO PHARAOH THAT YOU MAY BRING MY PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT

 BUT MOSES SAID TO GOD WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD GO TO PHARAOH AND BRING THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT

 HE SAID BUT I WILL BE WITH YOU AND THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN FOR YOU THAT I HAVE SENT YOU WHEN YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OUT OF EGYPT YOU SHALL SERVE GOD ON THIS MOUNTAIN

 THEN MOSES SAID TO GOD IF I COME TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM 'THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS HAS SENT ME TO YOU' AND THEY ASK ME 'WHAT IS HIS NAME

' WHAT SHALL I SAY TO THEM

 GOD SAID TO MOSES I AM WHO I AM

 AND HE SAID SAY THIS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'I AM HAS SENT ME TO YOU

' GOD ALSO SAID TO MOSES SAY THIS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB HAS SENT ME TO YOU

' THIS IS MY NAME FOREVER AND THUS I AM TO BE REMEMBERED THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS

GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL TOGETHER AND SAY TO THEM 'THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM OF ISAAC AND OF JACOB HAS APPEARED TO ME SAYING I HAVE OBSERVED YOU AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO YOU IN EGYPT AND I PROMISE THAT I WILL BRING YOU UP OUT OF THE AFFLICTION OF EGYPT TO THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY

' AND THEY WILL LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE AND YOU AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL SHALL GO TO THE KING OF EGYPT AND SAY TO HIM 'THE LORD THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS HAS MET WITH US; AND NOW PLEASE LET US GO A THREE DAYS' JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS THAT WE MAY SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD

' BUT I KNOW THAT THE KING OF EGYPT WILL NOT LET YOU GO UNLESS COMPELLED BY A MIGHTY HAND

SO I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AND STRIKE EGYPT WITH ALL THE WONDERS THAT I WILL DO IN IT; AFTER THAT HE WILL LET YOU GO

AND I WILL GIVE THIS PEOPLE FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE EGYPTIANS; AND WHEN YOU GO YOU SHALL NOT GO EMPTY BUT EACH WOMAN SHALL ASK OF HER NEIGHBOR AND ANY WOMAN WHO LIVES IN HER HOUSE FOR SILVER AND GOLD JEWELRY AND FOR CLOTHING

YOU SHALL PUT THEM ON YOUR SONS AND ON YOUR DAUGHTERS

SO YOU SHALL PLUNDER THE EGYPTIANS

THEN MOSES ANSWERED BUT BEHOLD THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE ME OR LISTEN TO MY VOICE FOR THEY WILL SAY 'THE LORD DID NOT APPEAR TO YOU

' THE LORD SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR HAND

 HE SAID A STAFF

 AND HE SAID THROW IT ON THE GROUND

 SO HE THREW IT ON THE GROUND AND IT BECAME A SERPENT AND MOSES RAN FROM IT

BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PUT OUT YOUR HAND AND CATCH IT BY THE TAILSO HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND CAUGHT IT AND IT BECAME A STAFF IN HIS HAND THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE THAT THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB HAS APPEARED TO YOU

 AGAIN THE LORD SAID TO HIM PUT YOUR HAND INSIDE YOUR CLOAK

 AND HE PUT HIS HAND INSIDE HIS CLOAK AND WHEN HE TOOK IT OUT BEHOLD HIS HAND WAS LEPROUS LIKE SNOW

THEN GOD SAID PUT YOUR HAND BACK INSIDE YOUR CLOAK

 SO HE PUT HIS HAND BACK INSIDE HIS CLOAK AND WHEN HE TOOK IT OUT BEHOLD IT WAS RESTORED LIKE THE REST OF HIS FLESH

IF THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU GOD SAID OR LISTEN TO THE FIRST SIGN THEY MAY BELIEVE THE LATTER SIGN

IF THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE EVEN THESE TWO SIGNS OR LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE YOU SHALL TAKE SOME WATER FROM THE NILE AND POUR IT ON THE DRY GROUND AND THE WATER THAT YOU SHALL TAKE FROM THE NILE WILL BECOME BLOOD ON THE DRY GROUND

 BUT MOSES SAID TO THE LORD OH MY LORD I AM NOT ELOQUENT EITHER IN THE PAST OR SINCE YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO YOUR SERVANT BUT I AM SLOW OF SPEECH AND OF TONGUE

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO HIM WHO HAS MADE MAN'S MOUTH

WHO MAKES HIM MUTE OR DEAF OR SEEING OR BLIND

IS IT NOT I THE LORD

NOW THEREFORE GO AND I WILL BE WITH YOUR MOUTH AND TEACH YOU WHAT YOU SHALL SPEAK

 BUT HE SAID OH MY LORD PLEASE SEND SOMEONE ELSE

 THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST MOSES AND HE SAID IS THERE NOT AARON YOUR BROTHER THE LEVITE

I KNOW THAT HE CAN SPEAK WELL

BEHOLD HE IS COMING OUT TO MEET YOU AND WHEN HE SEES YOU HE WILL BE GLAD IN HIS HEART

YOU SHALL SPEAK TO HIM AND PUT THE WORDS IN HIS MOUTH AND I WILL BE WITH YOUR MOUTH AND WITH HIS MOUTH AND WILL TEACH YOU BOTH WHAT TO DO

HE SHALL SPEAK FOR YOU TO THE PEOPLE AND HE SHALL BE YOUR MOUTH AND YOU SHALL BE AS GOD TO HIM

AND TAKE IN YOUR HAND THIS STAFF WITH WHICH YOU SHALL DO THE SIGNS

 MOSES WENT BACK TO JETHRO HIS FATHERINLAW AND SAID TO HIM PLEASE LET ME GO BACK TO MY BROTHERS IN EGYPT TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE STILL ALIVE

 AND JETHRO SAID TO MOSES GO IN PEACE

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES IN MIDIAN GO BACK TO EGYPT FOR ALL THE MEN WHO WERE SEEKING YOUR LIFE ARE DEAD

 SO MOSES TOOK HIS WIFE AND HIS SONS AND HAD THEM RIDE ON A DONKEY AND WENT BACK TO THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND MOSES TOOK THE STAFF OF GOD IN HIS HAND

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES WHEN YOU GO BACK TO EGYPT SEE THAT YOU DO BEFORE PHARAOH ALL THE MIRACLES THAT I HAVE PUT IN YOUR POWER

BUT I WILL HARDEN HIS HEART SO THAT HE WILL NOT LET THE PEOPLE GO

THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO PHARAOH 'THUS SAYS THE LORD ISRAEL IS MY FIRSTBORN SON AND I SAY TO YOU LET MY SON GO THAT HE MAY SERVE ME

 IF YOU REFUSE TO LET HIM GO BEHOLD I WILL KILL YOUR FIRSTBORN SON

' AT A LODGING PLACE ON THE WAY THE LORD MET HIM AND SOUGHT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

THEN ZIPPORAH TOOK A FLINT AND CUT OFF HER SON'S FORESKIN AND TOUCHED MOSES' FEET WITH IT AND SAID SURELY YOU ARE A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD TO ME

 SO HE LET HIM ALONE

IT WAS THEN THAT SHE SAID A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMCISION

THE LORD SAID TO AARON GO INTO THE WILDERNESS TO MEET MOSES

 SO HE WENT AND MET HIM AT THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD AND KISSED HIM

AND MOSES TOLD AARON ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD WITH WHICH HE HAD SENT HIM TO SPEAK AND ALL THE SIGNS THAT HE HAD COMMANDED HIM TO DO

THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AARON SPOKE ALL THE WORDS THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN TO MOSES AND DID THE SIGNS IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE

AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED; AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE LORD HAD VISITED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THAT HE HAD SEEN THEIR AFFLICTION THEY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND WORSHIPED

AFTERWARD MOSES AND AARON WENT AND SAID TO PHARAOH THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY HOLD A FEAST TO ME IN THE WILDERNESS

' BUT PHARAOH SAID WHO IS THE LORD THAT I SHOULD OBEY HIS VOICE AND LET ISRAEL GO

I DO NOT KNOW THE LORD AND MOREOVER I WILL NOT LET ISRAEL GO

 THEN THEY SAID THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS HAS MET WITH US

PLEASE LET US GO A THREE DAYS' JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS THAT WE MAY SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD LEST HE FALL UPON US WITH PESTILENCE OR WITH THE SWORD

 BUT THE KING OF EGYPT SAID TO THEM MOSES AND AARON WHY DO YOU TAKE THE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR WORK

GET BACK TO YOUR BURDENS

 AND PHARAOH SAID BEHOLD THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND ARE NOW MANY AND YOU MAKE THEM REST FROM THEIR BURDENS

 THE SAME DAY PHARAOH COMMANDED THE TASKMASTERS OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR FOREMEN YOU SHALL NO LONGER GIVE THE PEOPLE STRAW TO MAKE BRICKS AS IN THE PAST; LET THEM GO AND GATHER STRAW FOR THEMSELVES

BUT THE NUMBER OF BRICKS THAT THEY MADE IN THE PAST YOU SHALL IMPOSE ON THEM YOU SHALL BY NO MEANS REDUCE IT FOR THEY ARE IDLE

THEREFORE THEY CRY 'LET US GO AND OFFER SACRIFICE TO OUR GOD

' LET HEAVIER WORK BE LAID ON THE MEN THAT THEY MAY LABOR AT IT AND PAY NO REGARD TO LYING WORDS

 SO THE TASKMASTERS AND THE FOREMEN OF THE PEOPLE WENT OUT AND SAID TO THE PEOPLE THUS SAYS PHARAOH 'I WILL NOT GIVE YOU STRAW

GO AND GET YOUR STRAW YOURSELVES WHEREVER YOU CAN FIND IT BUT YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE REDUCED IN THE LEAST

' SO THE PEOPLE WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT TO GATHER STUBBLE FOR STRAW

THE TASKMASTERS WERE URGENT SAYING COMPLETE YOUR WORK YOUR DAILY TASK EACH DAY AS WHEN THERE WAS STRAW

 AND THE FOREMEN OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHOM PHARAOH'S TASKMASTERS HAD SET OVER THEM WERE BEATEN AND WERE ASKED WHY HAVE YOU NOT DONE ALL YOUR TASK OF MAKING BRICKS TODAY AND YESTERDAY AS IN THE PAST

 THEN THE FOREMEN OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME AND CRIED TO PHARAOH WHY DO YOU TREAT YOUR SERVANTS LIKE THIS

NO STRAW IS GIVEN TO YOUR SERVANTS YET THEY SAY TO US 'MAKE BRICKS

' AND BEHOLD YOUR SERVANTS ARE BEATEN; BUT THE FAULT IS IN YOUR OWN PEOPLE

 BUT HE SAID YOU ARE IDLE YOU ARE IDLE; THAT IS WHY YOU SAY 'LET US GO AND SACRIFICE TO THE LORD

' GO NOW AND WORK

NO STRAW WILL BE GIVEN YOU BUT YOU MUST STILL DELIVER THE SAME NUMBER OF BRICKS

 THE FOREMEN OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAW THAT THEY WERE IN TROUBLE WHEN THEY SAID YOU SHALL BY NO MEANS REDUCE YOUR NUMBER OF BRICKS YOUR DAILY TASK EACH DAY

 THEY MET MOSES AND AARON WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM AS THEY CAME OUT FROM PHARAOH; AND THEY SAID TO THEM THE LORD LOOK ON YOU AND JUDGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE US STINK IN THE SIGHT OF PHARAOH AND HIS SERVANTS AND HAVE PUT A SWORD IN THEIR HAND TO KILL US

 THEN MOSES TURNED TO THE LORD AND SAID O LORD WHY HAVE YOU DONE EVIL TO THIS PEOPLE

WHY DID YOU EVER SEND ME

FOR SINCE I CAME TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME HE HAS DONE EVIL TO THIS PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE NOT DELIVERED YOUR PEOPLE AT ALL

BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES NOW YOU SHALL SEE WHAT I WILL DO TO PHARAOH; FOR WITH A STRONG HAND HE WILL SEND THEM OUT AND WITH A STRONG HAND HE WILL DRIVE THEM OUT OF HIS LAND

 GOD SPOKE TO MOSES AND SAID TO HIM I AM THE LORD

I APPEARED TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB AS GOD ALMIGHTY BUT BY MY NAME THE LORD I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO THEM

I ALSO ESTABLISHED MY COVENANT WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM THE LAND OF CANAAN THE LAND IN WHICH THEY LIVED AS SOJOURNERS

MOREOVER I HAVE HEARD THE GROANING OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHOM THE EGYPTIANS HOLD AS SLAVES AND I HAVE REMEMBERED MY COVENANT

SAY THEREFORE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'I AM THE LORD AND I WILL BRING YOU OUT FROM UNDER THE BURDENS OF THE EGYPTIANS AND I WILL DELIVER YOU FROM SLAVERY TO THEM AND I WILL REDEEM YOU WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND WITH GREAT ACTS OF JUDGMENT

I WILL TAKE YOU TO BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE YOUR GOD AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM UNDER THE BURDENS OF THE EGYPTIANS

I WILL BRING YOU INTO THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB

I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU FOR A POSSESSION

I AM THE LORD

' MOSES SPOKE THUS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BUT THEY DID NOT LISTEN TO MOSES BECAUSE OF THEIR BROKEN SPIRIT AND HARSH SLAVERY

SO THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO IN TELL PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT TO LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GO OUT OF HIS LAND

 BUT MOSES SAID TO THE LORD BEHOLD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAVE NOT LISTENED TO ME

HOW THEN SHALL PHARAOH LISTEN TO ME FOR I AM OF UNCIRCUMCISED LIPS

 BUT THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES AND AARON AND GAVE THEM A CHARGE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND ABOUT PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT TO BRING THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES THE SONS OF REUBEN THE FIRSTBORN OF ISRAEL HANOCH PALLU HEZRON AND CARMI; THESE ARE THE CLANS OF REUBEN

THE SONS OF SIMEON JEMUEL JAMIN OHAD JACHIN ZOHAR AND SHAUL THE SON OF A CANAANITE WOMAN; THESE ARE THE CLANS OF SIMEON

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE SONS OF LEVI ACCORDING TO THEIR GENERATIONS GERSHON KOHATH AND MERARI THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF LEVI BEING  YEARS

THE SONS OF GERSHON LIBNI AND SHIMEI BY THEIR CLANS

THE SONS OF KOHATH AMRAM IZHAR HEBRON AND UZZIEL THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF KOHATH BEING  YEARS

THE SONS OF MERARI MAHLI AND MUSHI

THESE ARE THE CLANS OF THE LEVITES ACCORDING TO THEIR GENERATIONS

AMRAM TOOK AS HIS WIFE JOCHEBED HIS FATHER'S SISTER AND SHE BORE HIM AARON AND MOSES THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF AMRAM BEING  YEARS

THE SONS OF IZHAR KORAH NEPHEG AND ZICHRI

THE SONS OF UZZIEL MISHAEL ELZAPHAN AND SITHRI

AARON TOOK AS HIS WIFE ELISHEBA THE DAUGHTER OF AMMINADAB AND THE SISTER OF NAHSHON AND SHE BORE HIM NADAB ABIHU ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR

THE SONS OF KORAH ASSIR ELKANAH AND ABIASAPH; THESE ARE THE CLANS OF THE KORAHITES

ELEAZAR AARON'S SON TOOK AS HIS WIFE ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF PUTIEL AND SHE BORE HIM PHINEHAS

THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE LEVITES BY THEIR CLANS

THESE ARE THE AARON AND MOSES TO WHOM THE LORD SAID BRING OUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT BY THEIR HOSTS

 IT WAS THEY WHO SPOKE TO PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT ABOUT BRINGING OUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM EGYPT THIS MOSES AND THIS AARON

ON THE DAY WHEN THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES I AM THE LORD; TELL PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT ALL THAT I SAY TO YOU

 BUT MOSES SAID TO THE LORD BEHOLD I AM OF UNCIRCUMCISED LIPS

HOW WILL PHARAOH LISTEN TO ME

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES SEE I HAVE MADE YOU LIKE GOD TO PHARAOH AND YOUR BROTHER AARON SHALL BE YOUR PROPHET

YOU SHALL SPEAK ALL THAT I COMMAND YOU AND YOUR BROTHER AARON SHALL TELL PHARAOH TO LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GO OUT OF HIS LAND

BUT I WILL HARDEN PHARAOH'S HEART AND THOUGH I MULTIPLY MY SIGNS AND WONDERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT PHARAOH WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU

THEN I WILL LAY MY HAND ON EGYPT AND BRING MY HOSTS MY PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT BY GREAT ACTS OF JUDGMENT

THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST EGYPT AND BRING OUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM AMONG THEM

 MOSES AND AARON DID SO; THEY DID JUST AS THE LORD COMMANDED THEM

NOW MOSES WAS EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND AARON EIGHTYTHREE YEARS OLD WHEN THEY SPOKE TO PHARAOH

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON WHEN PHARAOH SAYS TO YOU 'PROVE YOURSELVES BY WORKING A MIRACLE' THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO AARON 'TAKE YOUR STAFF AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH THAT IT MAY BECOME A SERPENT

' SO MOSES AND AARON WENT TO PHARAOH AND DID JUST AS THE LORD COMMANDED

AARON CAST DOWN HIS STAFF BEFORE PHARAOH AND HIS SERVANTS AND IT BECAME A SERPENT

THEN PHARAOH SUMMONED THE WISE MEN AND THE SORCERERS AND THEY THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT ALSO DID THE SAME BY THEIR SECRET ARTS

FOR EACH MAN CAST DOWN HIS STAFF AND THEY BECAME SERPENTS

BUT AARON'S STAFF SWALLOWED UP THEIR STAFFS

STILL PHARAOH'S HEART WAS HARDENED AND HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM AS THE LORD HAD SAID

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PHARAOH'S HEART IS HARDENED; HE REFUSES TO LET THE PEOPLE GO

GO TO PHARAOH IN THE MORNING AS HE IS GOING OUT TO THE WATER

STAND ON THE BANK OF THE NILE TO MEET HIM AND TAKE IN YOUR HAND THE STAFF THAT TURNED INTO A SERPENT

AND YOU SHALL SAY TO HIM 'THE LORD THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS SENT ME TO YOU SAYING LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME IN THE WILDERNESS

BUT SO FAR YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED

 THUS SAYS THE LORD BY THIS YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD BEHOLD WITH THE STAFF THAT IS IN MY HAND I WILL STRIKE THE WATER THAT IS IN THE NILE AND IT SHALL TURN INTO BLOOD

THE FISH IN THE NILE SHALL DIE AND THE NILE WILL STINK AND THE EGYPTIANS WILL GROW WEARY OF DRINKING WATER FROM THE NILE

' AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES SAY TO AARON 'TAKE YOUR STAFF AND STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE WATERS OF EGYPT OVER THEIR RIVERS THEIR CANALS AND THEIR PONDS AND ALL THEIR POOLS OF WATER SO THAT THEY MAY BECOME BLOOD AND THERE SHALL BE BLOOD THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT EVEN IN VESSELS OF WOOD AND IN VESSELS OF STONE

' MOSES AND AARON DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED

IN THE SIGHT OF PHARAOH AND IN THE SIGHT OF HIS SERVANTS HE LIFTED UP THE STAFF AND STRUCK THE WATER IN THE NILE AND ALL THE WATER IN THE NILE TURNED INTO BLOOD

AND THE FISH IN THE NILE DIED AND THE NILE STANK SO THAT THE EGYPTIANS COULD NOT DRINK WATER FROM THE NILE

THERE WAS BLOOD THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

BUT THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT DID THE SAME BY THEIR SECRET ARTS

SO PHARAOH'S HEART REMAINED HARDENED AND HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM AS THE LORD HAD SAID

PHARAOH TURNED AND WENT INTO HIS HOUSE AND HE DID NOT TAKE EVEN THIS TO HEART

AND ALL THE EGYPTIANS DUG ALONG THE NILE FOR WATER TO DRINK FOR THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF THE NILE

SEVEN FULL DAYS PASSED AFTER THE LORD HAD STRUCK THE NILE

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO IN TO PHARAOH AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME

BUT IF YOU REFUSE TO LET THEM GO BEHOLD I WILL PLAGUE ALL YOUR COUNTRY WITH FROGS

THE NILE SHALL SWARM WITH FROGS THAT SHALL COME UP INTO YOUR HOUSE AND INTO YOUR BEDROOM AND ON YOUR BED AND INTO THE HOUSES OF YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE AND INTO YOUR OVENS AND YOUR KNEADING BOWLS

THE FROGS SHALL COME UP ON YOU AND ON YOUR PEOPLE AND ON ALL YOUR SERVANTS

' AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES SAY TO AARON 'STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND WITH YOUR STAFF OVER THE RIVERS OVER THE CANALS AND OVER THE POOLS AND MAKE FROGS COME UP ON THE LAND OF EGYPT

' SO AARON STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND OVER THE WATERS OF EGYPT AND THE FROGS CAME UP AND COVERED THE LAND OF EGYPT

BUT THE MAGICIANS DID THE SAME BY THEIR SECRET ARTS AND MADE FROGS COME UP ON THE LAND OF EGYPT

THEN PHARAOH CALLED MOSES AND AARON AND SAID PLEAD WITH THE LORD TO TAKE AWAY THE FROGS FROM ME AND FROM MY PEOPLE AND I WILL LET THE PEOPLE GO TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD

 MOSES SAID TO PHARAOH BE PLEASED TO COMMAND ME WHEN I AM TO PLEAD FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR SERVANTS AND FOR YOUR PEOPLE THAT THE FROGS BE CUT OFF FROM YOU AND YOUR HOUSES AND BE LEFT ONLY IN THE NILE

 AND HE SAID TOMORROW

 MOSES SAID BE IT AS YOU SAY SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ONE LIKE THE LORD OUR GOD

THE FROGS SHALL GO AWAY FROM YOU AND YOUR HOUSES AND YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE

THEY SHALL BE LEFT ONLY IN THE NILE

 SO MOSES AND AARON WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH AND MOSES CRIED TO THE LORD ABOUT THE FROGS AS HE HAD AGREED WITH PHARAOH

AND THE LORD DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES

THE FROGS DIED OUT IN THE HOUSES THE COURTYARDS AND THE FIELDS

AND THEY GATHERED THEM TOGETHER IN HEAPS AND THE LAND STANK

BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT THERE WAS A RESPITE HE HARDENED HIS HEART AND WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM AS THE LORD HAD SAID

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES SAY TO AARON 'STRETCH OUT YOUR STAFF AND STRIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH SO THAT IT MAY BECOME GNATS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

' AND THEY DID SO

AARON STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND WITH HIS STAFF AND STRUCK THE DUST OF THE EARTH AND THERE WERE GNATS ON MAN AND BEAST

ALL THE DUST OF THE EARTH BECAME GNATS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

THE MAGICIANS TRIED BY THEIR SECRET ARTS TO PRODUCE GNATS BUT THEY COULD NOT

SO THERE WERE GNATS ON MAN AND BEAST

THEN THE MAGICIANS SAID TO PHARAOH THIS IS THE FINGER OF GOD

 BUT PHARAOH'S HEART WAS HARDENED AND HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM AS THE LORD HAD SAID

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES RISE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND PRESENT YOURSELF TO PHARAOH AS HE GOES OUT TO THE WATER AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME

OR ELSE IF YOU WILL NOT LET MY PEOPLE GO BEHOLD I WILL SEND SWARMS OF FLIES ON YOU AND YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE AND INTO YOUR HOUSES

AND THE HOUSES OF THE EGYPTIANS SHALL BE FILLED WITH SWARMS OF FLIES AND ALSO THE GROUND ON WHICH THEY STAND

BUT ON THAT DAY I WILL SET APART THE LAND OF GOSHEN WHERE MY PEOPLE DWELL SO THAT NO SWARMS OF FLIES SHALL BE THERE THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH

THUS I WILL PUT A DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND YOUR PEOPLE

TOMORROW THIS SIGN SHALL HAPPEN

' AND THE LORD DID SO

THERE CAME GREAT SWARMS OF FLIES INTO THE HOUSE OF PHARAOH AND INTO HIS SERVANTS' HOUSES

THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT THE LAND WAS RUINED BY THE SWARMS OF FLIES

THEN PHARAOH CALLED MOSES AND AARON AND SAID GO SACRIFICE TO YOUR GOD WITHIN THE LAND

 BUT MOSES SAID IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO DO SO FOR THE OFFERINGS WE SHALL SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE EGYPTIANS

IF WE SACRIFICE OFFERINGS ABOMINABLE TO THE EGYPTIANS BEFORE THEIR EYES WILL THEY NOT STONE US

WE MUST GO THREE DAYS' JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS AND SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD AS HE TELLS US

 SO PHARAOH SAID I WILL LET YOU GO TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD YOUR GOD IN THE WILDERNESS; ONLY YOU MUST NOT GO VERY FAR AWAY

PLEAD FOR ME

 THEN MOSES SAID BEHOLD I AM GOING OUT FROM YOU AND I WILL PLEAD WITH THE LORD THAT THE SWARMS OF FLIES MAY DEPART FROM PHARAOH FROM HIS SERVANTS AND FROM HIS PEOPLE TOMORROW

ONLY LET NOT PHARAOH CHEAT AGAIN BY NOT LETTING THE PEOPLE GO TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD

 SO MOSES WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH AND PRAYED TO THE LORD

AND THE LORD DID AS MOSES ASKED AND REMOVED THE SWARMS OF FLIES FROM PHARAOH FROM HIS SERVANTS AND FROM HIS PEOPLE; NOT ONE REMAINED

BUT PHARAOH HARDENED HIS HEART THIS TIME ALSO AND DID NOT LET THE PEOPLE GO

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO IN TO PHARAOH AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME

FOR IF YOU REFUSE TO LET THEM GO AND STILL HOLD THEM BEHOLD THE HAND OF THE LORD WILL FALL WITH A VERY SEVERE PLAGUE UPON YOUR LIVESTOCK THAT ARE IN THE FIELD THE HORSES THE DONKEYS THE CAMELS THE HERDS AND THE FLOCKS

BUT THE LORD WILL MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LIVESTOCK OF ISRAEL AND THE LIVESTOCK OF EGYPT SO THAT NOTHING OF ALL THAT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL DIE

' AND THE LORD SET A TIME SAYING TOMORROW THE LORD WILL DO THIS THING IN THE LAND

 AND THE NEXT DAY THE LORD DID THIS THING

ALL THE LIVESTOCK OF THE EGYPTIANS DIED BUT NOT ONE OF THE LIVESTOCK OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DIED

AND PHARAOH SENT AND BEHOLD NOT ONE OF THE LIVESTOCK OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD

BUT THE HEART OF PHARAOH WAS HARDENED AND HE DID NOT LET THE PEOPLE GO

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON TAKE HANDFULS OF SOOT FROM THE KILN AND LET MOSES THROW THEM IN THE AIR IN THE SIGHT OF PHARAOH

IT SHALL BECOME FINE DUST OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT AND BECOME BOILS BREAKING OUT IN SORES ON MAN AND BEAST THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

 SO THEY TOOK SOOT FROM THE KILN AND STOOD BEFORE PHARAOH

AND MOSES THREW IT IN THE AIR AND IT BECAME BOILS BREAKING OUT IN SORES ON MAN AND BEAST

AND THE MAGICIANS COULD NOT STAND BEFORE MOSES BECAUSE OF THE BOILS FOR THE BOILS CAME UPON THE MAGICIANS AND UPON ALL THE EGYPTIANS

BUT THE LORD HARDENED THE HEART OF PHARAOH AND HE DID NOT LISTEN TO THEM AS THE LORD HAD SPOKEN TO MOSES

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES RISE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE PHARAOH AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME

FOR THIS TIME I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES ON YOU YOURSELF AND ON YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE ME IN ALL THE EARTH

FOR BY NOW I COULD HAVE PUT OUT MY HAND AND STRUCK YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE WITH PESTILENCE AND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FROM THE EARTH

BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE RAISED YOU UP TO SHOW YOU MY POWER SO THAT MY NAME MAY BE PROCLAIMED IN ALL THE EARTH

YOU ARE STILL EXALTING YOURSELF AGAINST MY PEOPLE AND WILL NOT LET THEM GO

BEHOLD ABOUT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL CAUSE VERY HEAVY HAIL TO FALL SUCH AS NEVER HAS BEEN IN EGYPT FROM THE DAY IT WAS FOUNDED UNTIL NOW

NOW THEREFORE SEND GET YOUR LIVESTOCK AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE IN THE FIELD INTO SAFE SHELTER FOR EVERY MAN AND BEAST THAT IS IN THE FIELD AND IS NOT BROUGHT HOME WILL DIE WHEN THE HAIL FALLS ON THEM

' THEN WHOEVER FEARED THE WORD OF THE LORD AMONG THE SERVANTS OF PHARAOH HURRIED HIS SLAVES AND HIS LIVESTOCK INTO THE HOUSES BUT WHOEVER DID NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE WORD OF THE LORD LEFT HIS SLAVES AND HIS LIVESTOCK IN THE FIELD

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD HEAVEN SO THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT ON MAN AND BEAST AND EVERY PLANT OF THE FIELD IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

 THEN MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS STAFF TOWARD HEAVEN AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND HAIL AND FIRE RAN DOWN TO THE EARTH

AND THE LORD RAINED HAIL UPON THE LAND OF EGYPT

THERE WAS HAIL AND FIRE FLASHING CONTINUALLY IN THE MIDST OF THE HAIL VERY HEAVY HAIL SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT SINCE IT BECAME A NATION

THE HAIL STRUCK DOWN EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE FIELD IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT BOTH MAN AND BEAST

AND THE HAIL STRUCK DOWN EVERY PLANT OF THE FIELD AND BROKE EVERY TREE OF THE FIELD

ONLY IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN WHERE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE WAS THERE NO HAIL

THEN PHARAOH SENT AND CALLED MOSES AND AARON AND SAID TO THEM THIS TIME I HAVE SINNED; THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT AND I AND MY PEOPLE ARE IN THE WRONG

PLEAD WITH THE LORD FOR THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH OF GOD'S THUNDER AND HAIL

I WILL LET YOU GO AND YOU SHALL STAY NO LONGER

 MOSES SAID TO HIM AS SOON AS I HAVE GONE OUT OF THE CITY I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HANDS TO THE LORD

THE THUNDER WILL CEASE AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE HAIL SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S

BUT AS FOR YOU AND YOUR SERVANTS I KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT YET FEAR THE LORD GOD

 THE FLAX AND THE BARLEY WERE STRUCK DOWN FOR THE BARLEY WAS IN THE EAR AND THE FLAX WAS IN BUD

BUT THE WHEAT AND THE EMMER WERE NOT STRUCK DOWN FOR THEY ARE LATE IN COMING UP

 SO MOSES WENT OUT OF THE CITY FROM PHARAOH AND STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TO THE LORD AND THE THUNDER AND THE HAIL CEASED AND THE RAIN NO LONGER POURED UPON THE EARTH

BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT THE RAIN AND THE HAIL AND THE THUNDER HAD CEASED HE SINNED YET AGAIN AND HARDENED HIS HEART HE AND HIS SERVANTS

SO THE HEART OF PHARAOH WAS HARDENED AND HE DID NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GO JUST AS THE LORD HAD SPOKEN THROUGH MOSES

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO IN TO PHARAOH FOR I HAVE HARDENED HIS HEART AND THE HEART OF HIS SERVANTS THAT I MAY SHOW THESE SIGNS OF MINE AMONG THEM AND THAT YOU MAY TELL IN THE HEARING OF YOUR SON AND OF YOUR GRANDSON HOW I HAVE DEALT HARSHLY WITH THE EGYPTIANS AND WHAT SIGNS I HAVE DONE AMONG THEM THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 SO MOSES AND AARON WENT IN TO PHARAOH AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS 'HOW LONG WILL YOU REFUSE TO HUMBLE YOURSELF BEFORE ME

LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME

FOR IF YOU REFUSE TO LET MY PEOPLE GO BEHOLD TOMORROW I WILL BRING LOCUSTS INTO YOUR COUNTRY AND THEY SHALL COVER THE FACE OF THE LAND SO THAT NO ONE CAN SEE THE LAND

AND THEY SHALL EAT WHAT IS LEFT TO YOU AFTER THE HAIL AND THEY SHALL EAT EVERY TREE OF YOURS THAT GROWS IN THE FIELD AND THEY SHALL FILL YOUR HOUSES AND THE HOUSES OF ALL YOUR SERVANTS AND OF ALL THE EGYPTIANS AS NEITHER YOUR FATHERS NOR YOUR GRANDFATHERS HAVE SEEN FROM THE DAY THEY CAME ON EARTH TO THIS DAY

' THEN HE TURNED AND WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH

THEN PHARAOH'S SERVANTS SAID TO HIM HOW LONG SHALL THIS MAN BE A SNARE TO US

LET THE MEN GO THAT THEY MAY SERVE THE LORD THEIR GOD

DO YOU NOT YET UNDERSTAND THAT EGYPT IS RUINED

 SO MOSES AND AARON WERE BROUGHT BACK TO PHARAOH

AND HE SAID TO THEM GO SERVE THE LORD YOUR GOD

BUT WHICH ONES ARE TO GO

 MOSES SAID WE WILL GO WITH OUR YOUNG AND OUR OLD

WE WILL GO WITH OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND WITH OUR FLOCKS AND HERDS FOR WE MUST HOLD A FEAST TO THE LORD

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM THE LORD BE WITH YOU IF EVER I LET YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ONES GO

LOOK YOU HAVE SOME EVIL PURPOSE IN MIND

NO

GO THE MEN AMONG YOU AND SERVE THE LORD FOR THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ASKING

 AND THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT FROM PHARAOH'S PRESENCE

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THE LOCUSTS SO THAT THEY MAY COME UPON THE LAND OF EGYPT AND EAT EVERY PLANT IN THE LAND ALL THAT THE HAIL HAS LEFT

 SO MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS STAFF OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LORD BROUGHT AN EAST WIND UPON THE LAND ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT

WHEN IT WAS MORNING THE EAST WIND HAD BROUGHT THE LOCUSTS

THE LOCUSTS CAME UP OVER ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT AND SETTLED ON THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF EGYPT SUCH A DENSE SWARM OF LOCUSTS AS HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE NOR EVER WILL BE AGAIN

THEY COVERED THE FACE OF THE WHOLE LAND SO THAT THE LAND WAS DARKENED AND THEY ATE ALL THE PLANTS IN THE LAND AND ALL THE FRUIT OF THE TREES THAT THE HAIL HAD LEFT

NOT A GREEN THING REMAINED NEITHER TREE NOR PLANT OF THE FIELD THROUGH ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT

THEN PHARAOH HASTILY CALLED MOSES AND AARON AND SAID I HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD AND AGAINST YOU

NOW THEREFORE FORGIVE MY SIN PLEASE ONLY THIS ONCE AND PLEAD WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD ONLY TO REMOVE THIS DEATH FROM ME

 SO HE WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH AND PLEADED WITH THE LORD

AND THE LORD TURNED THE WIND INTO A VERY STRONG WEST WIND WHICH LIFTED THE LOCUSTS AND DROVE THEM INTO THE RED SEA

NOT A SINGLE LOCUST WAS LEFT IN ALL THE COUNTRY OF EGYPT

BUT THE LORD HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART AND HE DID NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GO

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD HEAVEN THAT THERE MAY BE DARKNESS OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT A DARKNESS TO BE FELT

 SO MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARD HEAVEN AND THERE WAS PITCH DARKNESS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT THREE DAYS

THEY DID NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER NOR DID ANYONE RISE FROM HIS PLACE FOR THREE DAYS BUT ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD LIGHT WHERE THEY LIVED

THEN PHARAOH CALLED MOSES AND SAID GO SERVE THE LORD; YOUR LITTLE ONES ALSO MAY GO WITH YOU; ONLY LET YOUR FLOCKS AND YOUR HERDS REMAIN BEHIND

 BUT MOSES SAID YOU MUST ALSO LET US HAVE SACRIFICES AND BURNT OFFERINGS THAT WE MAY SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD

OUR LIVESTOCK ALSO MUST GO WITH US; NOT A HOOF SHALL BE LEFT BEHIND FOR WE MUST TAKE OF THEM TO SERVE THE LORD OUR GOD AND WE DO NOT KNOW WITH WHAT WE MUST SERVE THE LORD UNTIL WE ARRIVE THERE

 BUT THE LORD HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART AND HE WOULD NOT LET THEM GO

THEN PHARAOH SAID TO HIM GET AWAY FROM ME; TAKE CARE NEVER TO SEE MY FACE AGAIN FOR ON THE DAY YOU SEE MY FACE YOU SHALL DIE

 MOSES SAID AS YOU SAY

I WILL NOT SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES YET ONE PLAGUE MORE I WILL BRING UPON PHARAOH AND UPON EGYPT

AFTERWARD HE WILL LET YOU GO FROM HERE

WHEN HE LETS YOU GO HE WILL DRIVE YOU AWAY COMPLETELY

SPEAK NOW IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ASK EVERY MAN OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND EVERY WOMAN OF HER NEIGHBOR FOR SILVER AND GOLD JEWELRY

 AND THE LORD GAVE THE PEOPLE FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE EGYPTIANS

MOREOVER THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY GREAT IN THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE SIGHT OF PHARAOH'S SERVANTS AND IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE

SO MOSES SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD ABOUT MIDNIGHT I WILL GO OUT IN THE MIDST OF EGYPT AND EVERY FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL DIE FROM THE FIRSTBORN OF PHARAOH WHO SITS ON HIS THRONE EVEN TO THE FIRSTBORN OF THE SLAVE GIRL WHO IS BEHIND THE HANDMILL AND ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF THE CATTLE

THERE SHALL BE A GREAT CRY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT SUCH AS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN NOR EVER WILL BE AGAIN

BUT NOT A DOG SHALL GROWL AGAINST ANY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EITHER MAN OR BEAST THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL

AND ALL THESE YOUR SERVANTS SHALL COME DOWN TO ME AND BOW DOWN TO ME SAYING 'GET OUT YOU AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW YOU

' AND AFTER THAT I WILL GO OUT

 AND HE WENT OUT FROM PHARAOH IN HOT ANGER

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PHARAOH WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU THAT MY WONDERS MAY BE MULTIPLIED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

 MOSES AND AARON DID ALL THESE WONDERS BEFORE PHARAOH AND THE LORD HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART AND HE DID NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GO OUT OF HIS LAND

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON IN THE LAND OF EGYPT THIS MONTH SHALL BE FOR YOU THE BEGINNING OF MONTHS

IT SHALL BE THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR FOR YOU

TELL ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL THAT ON THE TENTH DAY OF THIS MONTH EVERY MAN SHALL TAKE A LAMB ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES A LAMB FOR A HOUSEHOLD

AND IF THE HOUSEHOLD IS TOO SMALL FOR A LAMB THEN HE AND HIS NEAREST NEIGHBOR SHALL TAKE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF PERSONS; ACCORDING TO WHAT EACH CAN EAT YOU SHALL MAKE YOUR COUNT FOR THE LAMB

YOUR LAMB SHALL BE WITHOUT BLEMISH A MALE A YEAR OLD

YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM THE SHEEP OR FROM THE GOATS AND YOU SHALL KEEP IT UNTIL THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THIS MONTH WHEN THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHALL KILL THEIR LAMBS AT TWILIGHT

THEN THEY SHALL TAKE SOME OF THE BLOOD AND PUT IT ON THE TWO DOORPOSTS AND THE LINTEL OF THE HOUSES IN WHICH THEY EAT IT

THEY SHALL EAT THE FLESH THAT NIGHT ROASTED ON THE FIRE; WITH UNLEAVENED BREAD AND BITTER HERBS THEY SHALL EAT IT

DO NOT EAT ANY OF IT RAW OR BOILED IN WATER BUT ROASTED ITS HEAD WITH ITS LEGS AND ITS INNER PARTS

AND YOU SHALL LET NONE OF IT REMAIN UNTIL THE MORNING; ANYTHING THAT REMAINS UNTIL THE MORNING YOU SHALL BURN

IN THIS MANNER YOU SHALL EAT IT WITH YOUR BELT FASTENED YOUR SANDALS ON YOUR FEET AND YOUR STAFF IN YOUR HAND

AND YOU SHALL EAT IT IN HASTE

IT IS THE LORD'S PASSOVER

FOR I WILL PASS THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT THAT NIGHT AND I WILL STRIKE ALL THE FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT BOTH MAN AND BEAST; AND ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS I AM THE LORD

THE BLOOD SHALL BE A SIGN FOR YOU ON THE HOUSES WHERE YOU ARE

AND WHEN I SEE THE BLOOD I WILL PASS OVER YOU AND NO PLAGUE WILL BEFALL YOU TO DESTROY YOU WHEN I STRIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT

THIS DAY SHALL BE FOR YOU A MEMORIAL DAY AND YOU SHALL KEEP IT AS A FEAST TO THE LORD; THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS AS A STATUTE FOREVER YOU SHALL KEEP IT AS A FEAST

SEVEN DAYS YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD

ON THE FIRST DAY YOU SHALL REMOVE LEAVEN OUT OF YOUR HOUSES FOR IF ANYONE EATS WHAT IS LEAVENED FROM THE FIRST DAY UNTIL THE SEVENTH DAY THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM ISRAEL

ON THE FIRST DAY YOU SHALL HOLD A HOLY ASSEMBLY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY A HOLY ASSEMBLY

NO WORK SHALL BE DONE ON THOSE DAYS

BUT WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO EAT THAT ALONE MAY BE PREPARED BY YOU

AND YOU SHALL OBSERVE THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD FOR ON THIS VERY DAY I BROUGHT YOUR HOSTS OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

THEREFORE YOU SHALL OBSERVE THIS DAY THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS AS A STATUTE FOREVER

IN THE FIRST MONTH FROM THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH AT EVENING YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD UNTIL THE TWENTYFIRST DAY OF THE MONTH AT EVENING

FOR SEVEN DAYS NO LEAVEN IS TO BE FOUND IN YOUR HOUSES

IF ANYONE EATS WHAT IS LEAVENED THAT PERSON WILL BE CUT OFF FROM THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL WHETHER HE IS A SOJOURNER OR A NATIVE OF THE LAND

YOU SHALL EAT NOTHING LEAVENED; IN ALL YOUR DWELLING PLACES YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD

 THEN MOSES CALLED ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND SAID TO THEM GO AND SELECT LAMBS FOR YOURSELVES ACCORDING TO YOUR CLANS AND KILL THE PASSOVER LAMB

TAKE A BUNCH OF HYSSOP AND DIP IT IN THE BLOOD THAT IS IN THE BASIN AND TOUCH THE LINTEL AND THE TWO DOORPOSTS WITH THE BLOOD THAT IS IN THE BASIN

NONE OF YOU SHALL GO OUT OF THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE UNTIL THE MORNING

FOR THE LORD WILL PASS THROUGH TO STRIKE THE EGYPTIANS AND WHEN HE SEES THE BLOOD ON THE LINTEL AND ON THE TWO DOORPOSTS THE LORD WILL PASS OVER THE DOOR AND WILL NOT ALLOW THE DESTROYER TO ENTER YOUR HOUSES TO STRIKE YOU

YOU SHALL OBSERVE THIS RITE AS A STATUTE FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR SONS FOREVER

AND WHEN YOU COME TO THE LAND THAT THE LORD WILL GIVE YOU AS HE HAS PROMISED YOU SHALL KEEP THIS SERVICE

AND WHEN YOUR CHILDREN SAY TO YOU 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS SERVICE

' YOU SHALL SAY 'IT IS THE SACRIFICE OF THE LORD'S PASSOVER FOR HE PASSED OVER THE HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN EGYPT WHEN HE STRUCK THE EGYPTIANS BUT SPARED OUR HOUSES

' AND THE PEOPLE BOWED THEIR HEADS AND WORSHIPED

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT AND DID SO; AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES AND AARON SO THEY DID

AT MIDNIGHT THE LORD STRUCK DOWN ALL THE FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT FROM THE FIRSTBORN OF PHARAOH WHO SAT ON HIS THRONE TO THE FIRSTBORN OF THE CAPTIVE WHO WAS IN THE DUNGEON AND ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF THE LIVESTOCK

AND PHARAOH ROSE UP IN THE NIGHT HE AND ALL HIS SERVANTS AND ALL THE EGYPTIANS

AND THERE WAS A GREAT CRY IN EGYPT FOR THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE WHERE SOMEONE WAS NOT DEAD

THEN HE SUMMONED MOSES AND AARON BY NIGHT AND SAID UP GO OUT FROM AMONG MY PEOPLE BOTH YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL; AND GO SERVE THE LORD AS YOU HAVE SAID

TAKE YOUR FLOCKS AND YOUR HERDS AS YOU HAVE SAID AND BE GONE AND BLESS ME ALSO

 THE EGYPTIANS WERE URGENT WITH THE PEOPLE TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE LAND IN HASTE

FOR THEY SAID WE SHALL ALL BE DEAD

 SO THE PEOPLE TOOK THEIR DOUGH BEFORE IT WAS LEAVENED THEIR KNEADING BOWLS BEING BOUND UP IN THEIR CLOAKS ON THEIR SHOULDERS

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD ALSO DONE AS MOSES TOLD THEM FOR THEY HAD ASKED THE EGYPTIANS FOR SILVER AND GOLD JEWELRY AND FOR CLOTHING

AND THE LORD HAD GIVEN THE PEOPLE FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE EGYPTIANS SO THAT THEY LET THEM HAVE WHAT THEY ASKED

THUS THEY PLUNDERED THE EGYPTIANS

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED FROM RAMESES TO SUCCOTH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT BESIDES WOMEN AND CHILDREN

A MIXED MULTITUDE ALSO WENT UP WITH THEM AND VERY MUCH LIVESTOCK BOTH FLOCKS AND HERDS

AND THEY BAKED UNLEAVENED CAKES OF THE DOUGH THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT OUT OF EGYPT FOR IT WAS NOT LEAVENED BECAUSE THEY WERE THRUST OUT OF EGYPT AND COULD NOT WAIT NOR HAD THEY PREPARED ANY PROVISIONS FOR THEMSELVES

THE TIME THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL LIVED IN EGYPT WAS  YEARS

AT THE END OF  YEARS ON THAT VERY DAY ALL THE HOSTS OF THE LORD WENT OUT FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT

IT WAS A NIGHT OF WATCHING BY THE LORD TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; SO THIS SAME NIGHT IS A NIGHT OF WATCHING KEPT TO THE LORD BY ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE PASSOVER NO FOREIGNER SHALL EAT OF IT BUT EVERY SLAVE THAT IS BOUGHT FOR MONEY MAY EAT OF IT AFTER YOU HAVE CIRCUMCISED HIM

NO FOREIGNER OR HIRED SERVANT MAY EAT OF IT

IT SHALL BE EATEN IN ONE HOUSE; YOU SHALL NOT TAKE ANY OF THE FLESH OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND YOU SHALL NOT BREAK ANY OF ITS BONES

ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHALL KEEP IT

IF A STRANGER SHALL SOJOURN WITH YOU AND WOULD KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD LET ALL HIS MALES BE CIRCUMCISED

THEN HE MAY COME NEAR AND KEEP IT; HE SHALL BE AS A NATIVE OF THE LAND

BUT NO UNCIRCUMCISED PERSON SHALL EAT OF IT

THERE SHALL BE ONE LAW FOR THE NATIVE AND FOR THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS AMONG YOU

 ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID JUST AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES AND AARON

AND ON THAT VERY DAY THE LORD BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT BY THEIR HOSTS

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES CONSECRATE TO ME ALL THE FIRSTBORN

WHATEVER IS THE FIRST TO OPEN THE WOMB AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST IS MINE

 THEN MOSES SAID TO THE PEOPLE REMEMBER THIS DAY IN WHICH YOU CAME OUT FROM EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY FOR BY A STRONG HAND THE LORD BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM THIS PLACE

NO LEAVENED BREAD SHALL BE EATEN

TODAY IN THE MONTH OF ABIB YOU ARE GOING OUT

AND WHEN THE LORD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES WHICH HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE YOU A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY YOU SHALL KEEP THIS SERVICE IN THIS MONTH

SEVEN DAYS YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY THERE SHALL BE A FEAST TO THE LORD

UNLEAVENED BREAD SHALL BE EATEN FOR SEVEN DAYS; NO LEAVENED BREAD SHALL BE SEEN WITH YOU AND NO LEAVEN SHALL BE SEEN WITH YOU IN ALL YOUR TERRITORY

YOU SHALL TELL YOUR SON ON THAT DAY 'IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT THE LORD DID FOR ME WHEN I CAME OUT OF EGYPT

' AND IT SHALL BE TO YOU AS A SIGN ON YOUR HAND AND AS A MEMORIAL BETWEEN YOUR EYES THAT THE LAW OF THE LORD MAY BE IN YOUR MOUTH

FOR WITH A STRONG HAND THE LORD HAS BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT

YOU SHALL THEREFORE KEEP THIS STATUTE AT ITS APPOINTED TIME FROM YEAR TO YEAR

WHEN THE LORD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES AS HE SWORE TO YOU AND YOUR FATHERS AND SHALL GIVE IT TO YOU YOU SHALL SET APART TO THE LORD ALL THAT FIRST OPENS THE WOMB

ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF YOUR ANIMALS THAT ARE MALES SHALL BE THE LORD'S

EVERY FIRSTBORN OF A DONKEY YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB OR IF YOU WILL NOT REDEEM IT YOU SHALL BREAK ITS NECK

EVERY FIRSTBORN OF MAN AMONG YOUR SONS YOU SHALL REDEEM

AND WHEN IN TIME TO COME YOUR SON ASKS YOU 'WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

' YOU SHALL SAY TO HIM 'BY A STRONG HAND THE LORD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT FROM THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY

FOR WHEN PHARAOH STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO LET US GO THE LORD KILLED ALL THE FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT BOTH THE FIRSTBORN OF MAN AND THE FIRSTBORN OF ANIMALS

THEREFORE I SACRIFICE TO THE LORD ALL THE MALES THAT FIRST OPEN THE WOMB BUT ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF MY SONS I REDEEM

' IT SHALL BE AS A MARK ON YOUR HAND OR FRONTLETS BETWEEN YOUR EYES FOR BY A STRONG HAND THE LORD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT

 WHEN PHARAOH LET THE PEOPLE GO GOD DID NOT LEAD THEM BY WAY OF THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NEAR

FOR GOD SAID LEST THE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS WHEN THEY SEE WAR AND RETURN TO EGYPT

 BUT GOD LED THE PEOPLE AROUND BY THE WAY OF THE WILDERNESS TOWARD THE RED SEA

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT EQUIPPED FOR BATTLE

MOSES TOOK THE BONES OF JOSEPH WITH HIM FOR JOSEPH HAD MADE THE SONS OF ISRAEL SOLEMNLY SWEAR SAYING GOD WILL SURELY VISIT YOU AND YOU SHALL CARRY UP MY BONES WITH YOU FROM HERE

 AND THEY MOVED ON FROM SUCCOTH AND ENCAMPED AT ETHAM ON THE EDGE OF THE WILDERNESS

AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO LEAD THEM ALONG THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT THAT THEY MIGHT TRAVEL BY DAY AND BY NIGHT

THE PILLAR OF CLOUD BY DAY AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT DID NOT DEPART FROM BEFORE THE PEOPLE

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES TELL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO TURN BACK AND ENCAMP IN FRONT OF PIHAHIROTH BETWEEN MIGDOL AND THE SEA IN FRONT OF BAALZEPHON; YOU SHALL ENCAMP FACING IT BY THE SEA

FOR PHARAOH WILL SAY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'THEY ARE WANDERING IN THE LAND; THE WILDERNESS HAS SHUT THEM IN

' AND I WILL HARDEN PHARAOH'S HEART AND HE WILL PURSUE THEM AND I WILL GET GLORY OVER PHARAOH AND ALL HIS HOST AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 AND THEY DID SO

WHEN THE KING OF EGYPT WAS TOLD THAT THE PEOPLE HAD FLED THE MIND OF PHARAOH AND HIS SERVANTS WAS CHANGED TOWARD THE PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT IS THIS WE HAVE DONE THAT WE HAVE LET ISRAEL GO FROM SERVING US

 SO HE MADE READY HIS CHARIOT AND TOOK HIS ARMY WITH HIM AND TOOK SIX HUNDRED CHOSEN CHARIOTS AND ALL THE OTHER CHARIOTS OF EGYPT WITH OFFICERS OVER ALL OF THEM

AND THE LORD HARDENED THE HEART OF PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT AND HE PURSUED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHILE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE GOING OUT DEFIANTLY

THE EGYPTIANS PURSUED THEM ALL PHARAOH'S HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN AND HIS ARMY AND OVERTOOK THEM ENCAMPED AT THE SEA BY PIHAHIROTH IN FRONT OF BAALZEPHON

WHEN PHARAOH DREW NEAR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL LIFTED UP THEIR EYES AND BEHOLD THE EGYPTIANS WERE MARCHING AFTER THEM AND THEY FEARED GREATLY

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD

THEY SAID TO MOSES IS IT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GRAVES IN EGYPT THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN US AWAY TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US IN BRINGING US OUT OF EGYPT

IS NOT THIS WHAT WE SAID TO YOU IN EGYPT 'LEAVE US ALONE THAT WE MAY SERVE THE EGYPTIANS'

FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR US TO SERVE THE EGYPTIANS THAN TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS

 AND MOSES SAID TO THE PEOPLE FEAR NOT STAND FIRM AND SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD WHICH HE WILL WORK FOR YOU TODAY

FOR THE EGYPTIANS WHOM YOU SEE TODAY YOU SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN

THE LORD WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE ONLY TO BE SILENT

 THE LORD SAID TO MOSES WHY DO YOU CRY TO ME

TELL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO GO FORWARD

LIFT UP YOUR STAFF AND STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE SEA AND DIVIDE IT THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MAY GO THROUGH THE SEA ON DRY GROUND

AND I WILL HARDEN THE HEARTS OF THE EGYPTIANS SO THAT THEY SHALL GO IN AFTER THEM AND I WILL GET GLORY OVER PHARAOH AND ALL HIS HOST HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN

AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I HAVE GOTTEN GLORY OVER PHARAOH HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN

 THEN THE ANGEL OF GOD WHO WAS GOING BEFORE THE HOST OF ISRAEL MOVED AND WENT BEHIND THEM AND THE PILLAR OF CLOUD MOVED FROM BEFORE THEM AND STOOD BEHIND THEM COMING BETWEEN THE HOST OF EGYPT AND THE HOST OF ISRAEL

AND THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS

AND IT LIT UP THE NIGHT WITHOUT ONE COMING NEAR THE OTHER ALL NIGHT

THEN MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND OVER THE SEA AND THE LORD DROVE THE SEA BACK BY A STRONG EAST WIND ALL NIGHT AND MADE THE SEA DRY LAND AND THE WATERS WERE DIVIDED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA ON DRY GROUND THE WATERS BEING A WALL TO THEM ON THEIR RIGHT HAND AND ON THEIR LEFT

THE EGYPTIANS PURSUED AND WENT IN AFTER THEM INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA ALL PHARAOH'S HORSES HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN

AND IN THE MORNING WATCH THE LORD IN THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND OF CLOUD LOOKED DOWN ON THE EGYPTIAN FORCES AND THREW THE EGYPTIAN FORCES INTO A PANIC CLOGGING THEIR CHARIOT WHEELS SO THAT THEY DROVE HEAVILY

AND THE EGYPTIANS SAID LET US FLEE FROM BEFORE ISRAEL FOR THE LORD FIGHTS FOR THEM AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE SEA THAT THE WATER MAY COME BACK UPON THE EGYPTIANS UPON THEIR CHARIOTS AND UPON THEIR HORSEMEN

 SO MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND OVER THE SEA AND THE SEA RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL COURSE WHEN THE MORNING APPEARED

AND AS THE EGYPTIANS FLED INTO IT THE LORD THREW THE EGYPTIANS INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA

THE WATERS RETURNED AND COVERED THE CHARIOTS AND THE HORSEMEN; OF ALL THE HOST OF PHARAOH THAT HAD FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE SEA NOT ONE OF THEM REMAINED

BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WALKED ON DRY GROUND THROUGH THE SEA THE WATERS BEING A WALL TO THEM ON THEIR RIGHT HAND AND ON THEIR LEFT

THUS THE LORD SAVED ISRAEL THAT DAY FROM THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND ISRAEL SAW THE EGYPTIANS DEAD ON THE SEASHORE

ISRAEL SAW THE GREAT POWER THAT THE LORD USED AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS SO THE PEOPLE FEARED THE LORD AND THEY BELIEVED IN THE LORD AND IN HIS SERVANT MOSES

THEN MOSES AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SANG THIS SONG TO THE LORD SAYING I WILL SING TO THE LORD FOR HE HAS TRIUMPHED GLORIOUSLY; THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN INTO THE SEA

THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG AND HE HAS BECOME MY SALVATION; THIS IS MY GOD AND I WILL PRAISE HIM MY FATHER'S GOD AND I WILL EXALT HIM

THE LORD IS A MAN OF WAR; THE LORD IS HIS NAME

PHARAOH'S CHARIOTS AND HIS HOST HE CAST INTO THE SEA AND HIS CHOSEN OFFICERS WERE SUNK IN THE RED SEA

THE FLOODS COVERED THEM; THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS LIKE A STONE

YOUR RIGHT HAND O LORD GLORIOUS IN POWER YOUR RIGHT HAND O LORD SHATTERS THE ENEMY

IN THE GREATNESS OF YOUR MAJESTY YOU OVERTHROW YOUR ADVERSARIES; YOU SEND OUT YOUR FURY; IT CONSUMES THEM LIKE STUBBLE

AT THE BLAST OF YOUR NOSTRILS THE WATERS PILED UP; THE FLOODS STOOD UP IN A HEAP; THE DEEPS CONGEALED IN THE HEART OF THE SEA

THE ENEMY SAID 'I WILL PURSUE I WILL OVERTAKE I WILL DIVIDE THE SPOIL MY DESIRE SHALL HAVE ITS FILL OF THEM

I WILL DRAW MY SWORD; MY HAND SHALL DESTROY THEM

' YOU BLEW WITH YOUR WIND; THE SEA COVERED THEM; THEY SANK LIKE LEAD IN THE MIGHTY WATERS

WHO IS LIKE YOU O LORD AMONG THE GODS

WHO IS LIKE YOU MAJESTIC IN HOLINESS AWESOME IN GLORIOUS DEEDS DOING WONDERS

YOU STRETCHED OUT YOUR RIGHT HAND; THE EARTH SWALLOWED THEM

YOU HAVE LED IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE REDEEMED; YOU HAVE GUIDED THEM BY YOUR STRENGTH TO YOUR HOLY ABODE

THE PEOPLES HAVE HEARD; THEY TREMBLE; PANGS HAVE SEIZED THE INHABITANTS OF PHILISTIA

NOW ARE THE CHIEFS OF EDOM DISMAYED; TREMBLING SEIZES THE LEADERS OF MOAB; ALL THE INHABITANTS OF CANAAN HAVE MELTED AWAY

TERROR AND DREAD FALL UPON THEM; BECAUSE OF THE GREATNESS OF YOUR ARM THEY ARE STILL AS A STONE TILL YOUR PEOPLE O LORD PASS BY TILL THE PEOPLE PASS BY WHOM YOU HAVE PURCHASED

YOU WILL BRING THEM IN AND PLANT THEM ON YOUR OWN MOUNTAIN THE PLACE O LORD WHICH YOU HAVE MADE FOR YOUR ABODE THE SANCTUARY O LORD WHICH YOUR HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED

THE LORD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER

 FOR WHEN THE HORSES OF PHARAOH WITH HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN WENT INTO THE SEA THE LORD BROUGHT BACK THE WATERS OF THE SEA UPON THEM BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WALKED ON DRY GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA

THEN MIRIAM THE PROPHETESS THE SISTER OF AARON TOOK A TAMBOURINE IN HER HAND AND ALL THE WOMEN WENT OUT AFTER HER WITH TAMBOURINES AND DANCING

AND MIRIAM SANG TO THEM SING TO THE LORD FOR HE HAS TRIUMPHED GLORIOUSLY; THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN INTO THE SEA

 THEN MOSES MADE ISRAEL SET OUT FROM THE RED SEA AND THEY WENT INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SHUR

THEY WENT THREE DAYS IN THE WILDERNESS AND FOUND NO WATER

WHEN THEY CAME TO MARAH THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF MARAH BECAUSE IT WAS BITTER; THEREFORE IT WAS NAMED MARAH

AND THE PEOPLE GRUMBLED AGAINST MOSES SAYING WHAT SHALL WE DRINK

 AND HE CRIED TO THE LORD AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM A LOG AND HE THREW IT INTO THE WATER AND THE WATER BECAME SWEET

THERE THE LORD MADE FOR THEM A STATUTE AND A RULE AND THERE HE TESTED THEM SAYING IF YOU WILL DILIGENTLY LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND DO THAT WHICH IS RIGHT IN HIS EYES AND GIVE EAR TO HIS COMMANDMENTS AND KEEP ALL HIS STATUTES I WILL PUT NONE OF THE DISEASES ON YOU THAT I PUT ON THE EGYPTIANS FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR HEALER

 THEN THEY CAME TO ELIM WHERE THERE WERE TWELVE SPRINGS OF WATER AND SEVENTY PALM TREES AND THEY ENCAMPED THERE BY THE WATER

THEY SET OUT FROM ELIM AND ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME TO THE WILDERNESS OF SIN WHICH IS BETWEEN ELIM AND SINAI ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH AFTER THEY HAD DEPARTED FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GRUMBLED AGAINST MOSES AND AARON IN THE WILDERNESS AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TO THEM WOULD THAT WE HAD DIED BY THE HAND OF THE LORD IN THE LAND OF EGYPT WHEN WE SAT BY THE MEAT POTS AND ATE BREAD TO THE FULL FOR YOU HAVE BROUGHT US OUT INTO THIS WILDERNESS TO KILL THIS WHOLE ASSEMBLY WITH HUNGER

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO RAIN BREAD FROM HEAVEN FOR YOU AND THE PEOPLE SHALL GO OUT AND GATHER A DAY'S PORTION EVERY DAY THAT I MAY TEST THEM WHETHER THEY WILL WALK IN MY LAW OR NOT

ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THEY PREPARE WHAT THEY BRING IN IT WILL BE TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY GATHER DAILY

 SO MOSES AND AARON SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT EVENING YOU SHALL KNOW THAT IT WAS THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND IN THE MORNING YOU SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE LORD BECAUSE HE HAS HEARD YOUR GRUMBLING AGAINST THE LORD

FOR WHAT ARE WE THAT YOU GRUMBLE AGAINST US

 AND MOSES SAID WHEN THE LORD GIVES YOU IN THE EVENING MEAT TO EAT AND IN THE MORNING BREAD TO THE FULL BECAUSE THE LORD HAS HEARD YOUR GRUMBLING THAT YOU GRUMBLE AGAINST HIMWHAT ARE WE

YOUR GRUMBLING IS NOT AGAINST US BUT AGAINST THE LORD

 THEN MOSES SAID TO AARON SAY TO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'COME NEAR BEFORE THE LORD FOR HE HAS HEARD YOUR GRUMBLING

' AND AS SOON AS AARON SPOKE TO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEY LOOKED TOWARD THE WILDERNESS AND BEHOLD THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED IN THE CLOUD

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES I HAVE HEARD THE GRUMBLING OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

SAY TO THEM 'AT TWILIGHT YOU SHALL EAT MEAT AND IN THE MORNING YOU SHALL BE FILLED WITH BREAD

THEN YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

' IN THE EVENING QUAIL CAME UP AND COVERED THE CAMP AND IN THE MORNING DEW LAY AROUND THE CAMP

AND WHEN THE DEW HAD GONE UP THERE WAS ON THE FACE OF THE WILDERNESS A FINE FLAKELIKE THING FINE AS FROST ON THE GROUND

WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAW IT THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS IT

 FOR THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS

AND MOSES SAID TO THEM IT IS THE BREAD THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU TO EAT

THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED 'GATHER OF IT EACH ONE OF YOU AS MUCH AS HE CAN EAT

YOU SHALL EACH TAKE AN OMER ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE PERSONS THAT EACH OF YOU HAS IN HIS TENT

' AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID SO

THEY GATHERED SOME MORE SOME LESS

BUT WHEN THEY MEASURED IT WITH AN OMER WHOEVER GATHERED MUCH HAD NOTHING LEFT OVER AND WHOEVER GATHERED LITTLE HAD NO LACK

EACH OF THEM GATHERED AS MUCH AS HE COULD EAT

AND MOSES SAID TO THEM LET NO ONE LEAVE ANY OF IT OVER TILL THE MORNING

 BUT THEY DID NOT LISTEN TO MOSES

SOME LEFT PART OF IT TILL THE MORNING AND IT BRED WORMS AND STANK

AND MOSES WAS ANGRY WITH THEM

MORNING BY MORNING THEY GATHERED IT EACH AS MUCH AS HE COULD EAT; BUT WHEN THE SUN GREW HOT IT MELTED

ON THE SIXTH DAY THEY GATHERED TWICE AS MUCH BREAD TWO OMERS EACH

AND WHEN ALL THE LEADERS OF THE CONGREGATION CAME AND TOLD MOSES HE SAID TO THEM THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED 'TOMORROW IS A DAY OF SOLEMN REST A HOLY SABBATH TO THE LORD; BAKE WHAT YOU WILL BAKE AND BOIL WHAT YOU WILL BOIL AND ALL THAT IS LEFT OVER LAY ASIDE TO BE KEPT TILL THE MORNING

' SO THEY LAID IT ASIDE TILL THE MORNING AS MOSES COMMANDED THEM AND IT DID NOT STINK AND THERE WERE NO WORMS IN IT

MOSES SAID EAT IT TODAY FOR TODAY IS A SABBATH TO THE LORD; TODAY YOU WILL NOT FIND IT IN THE FIELD

SIX DAYS YOU SHALL GATHER IT BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY WHICH IS A SABBATH THERE WILL BE NONE

 ON THE SEVENTH DAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WENT OUT TO GATHER BUT THEY FOUND NONE

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES HOW LONG WILL YOU REFUSE TO KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND MY LAWS

SEE

THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH; THEREFORE ON THE SIXTH DAY HE GIVES YOU BREAD FOR TWO DAYS

REMAIN EACH OF YOU IN HIS PLACE; LET NO ONE GO OUT OF HIS PLACE ON THE SEVENTH DAY

 SO THE PEOPLE RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY

NOW THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL CALLED ITS NAME MANNA

IT WAS LIKE CORIANDER SEED WHITE AND THE TASTE OF IT WAS LIKE WAFERS MADE WITH HONEY

MOSES SAID THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED 'LET AN OMER OF IT BE KEPT THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS SO THAT THEY MAY SEE THE BREAD WITH WHICH I FED YOU IN THE WILDERNESS WHEN I BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

' AND MOSES SAID TO AARON TAKE A JAR AND PUT AN OMER OF MANNA IN IT AND PLACE IT BEFORE THE LORD TO BE KEPT THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS

 AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES SO AARON PLACED IT BEFORE THE TESTIMONY TO BE KEPT

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ATE THE MANNA FORTY YEARS TILL THEY CAME TO A HABITABLE LAND

THEY ATE THE MANNA TILL THEY CAME TO THE BORDER OF THE LAND OF CANAAN

AN OMER IS THE TENTH PART OF AN EPHAH

ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MOVED ON FROM THE WILDERNESS OF SIN BY STAGES ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD AND CAMPED AT REPHIDIM BUT THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE PEOPLE TO DRINK

THEREFORE THE PEOPLE QUARRELED WITH MOSES AND SAID GIVE US WATER TO DRINK

 AND MOSES SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU QUARREL WITH ME

WHY DO YOU TEST THE LORD

 BUT THE PEOPLE THIRSTED THERE FOR WATER AND THE PEOPLE GRUMBLED AGAINST MOSES AND SAID WHY DID YOU BRING US UP OUT OF EGYPT TO KILL US AND OUR CHILDREN AND OUR LIVESTOCK WITH THIRST

 SO MOSES CRIED TO THE LORD WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THIS PEOPLE

THEY ARE ALMOST READY TO STONE ME

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PASS ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE TAKING WITH YOU SOME OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND TAKE IN YOUR HAND THE STAFF WITH WHICH YOU STRUCK THE NILE AND GO

BEHOLD I WILL STAND BEFORE YOU THERE ON THE ROCK AT HOREB AND YOU SHALL STRIKE THE ROCK AND WATER SHALL COME OUT OF IT AND THE PEOPLE WILL DRINK

 AND MOSES DID SO IN THE SIGHT OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL

AND HE CALLED THE NAME OF THE PLACE MASSAH AND MERIBAH BECAUSE OF THE QUARRELING OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND BECAUSE THEY TESTED THE LORD BY SAYING IS THE LORD AMONG US OR NOT

 THEN AMALEK CAME AND FOUGHT WITH ISRAEL AT REPHIDIM

SO MOSES SAID TO JOSHUA CHOOSE FOR US MEN AND GO OUT AND FIGHT WITH AMALEK

TOMORROW I WILL STAND ON THE TOP OF THE HILL WITH THE STAFF OF GOD IN MY HAND

 SO JOSHUA DID AS MOSES TOLD HIM AND FOUGHT WITH AMALEK WHILE MOSES AARON AND HUR WENT UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL

WHENEVER MOSES HELD UP HIS HAND ISRAEL PREVAILED AND WHENEVER HE LOWERED HIS HAND AMALEK PREVAILED

BUT MOSES' HANDS GREW WEARY SO THEY TOOK A STONE AND PUT IT UNDER HIM AND HE SAT ON IT WHILE AARON AND HUR HELD UP HIS HANDS ONE ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER SIDE

SO HIS HANDS WERE STEADY UNTIL THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN

AND JOSHUA OVERWHELMED AMALEK AND HIS PEOPLE WITH THE SWORD

THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES WRITE THIS AS A MEMORIAL IN A BOOK AND RECITE IT IN THE EARS OF JOSHUA THAT I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT THE MEMORY OF AMALEK FROM UNDER HEAVEN

 AND MOSES BUILT AN ALTAR AND CALLED THE NAME OF IT THE LORD IS MY BANNER SAYING A HAND UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD

THE LORD WILL HAVE WAR WITH AMALEK FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION

JETHRO THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN MOSES' FATHERINLAW HEARD OF ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE FOR MOSES AND FOR ISRAEL HIS PEOPLE HOW THE LORD HAD BROUGHT ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT

NOW JETHRO MOSES' FATHERINLAW HAD TAKEN ZIPPORAH MOSES' WIFE AFTER HE HAD SENT HER HOME ALONG WITH HER TWO SONS

THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS GERSHOM FOR HE SAID I HAVE BEEN A SOJOURNER IN A FOREIGN LAND AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER ELIEZER FOR HE SAID THE GOD OF MY FATHER WAS MY HELP AND DELIVERED ME FROM THE SWORD OF PHARAOH

JETHRO MOSES' FATHERINLAW CAME WITH HIS SONS AND HIS WIFE TO MOSES IN THE WILDERNESS WHERE HE WAS ENCAMPED AT THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD

AND WHEN HE SENT WORD TO MOSES I YOUR FATHERINLAW JETHRO AM COMING TO YOU WITH YOUR WIFE AND HER TWO SONS WITH HER MOSES WENT OUT TO MEET HIS FATHERINLAW AND BOWED DOWN AND KISSED HIM

AND THEY ASKED EACH OTHER OF THEIR WELFARE AND WENT INTO THE TENT

THEN MOSES TOLD HIS FATHERINLAW ALL THAT THE LORD HAD DONE TO PHARAOH AND TO THE EGYPTIANS FOR ISRAEL'S SAKE ALL THE HARDSHIP THAT HAD COME UPON THEM IN THE WAY AND HOW THE LORD HAD DELIVERED THEM

AND JETHRO REJOICED FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT THE LORD HAD DONE TO ISRAEL IN THAT HE HAD DELIVERED THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS

JETHRO SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO HAS DELIVERED YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND OUT OF THE HAND OF PHARAOH AND HAS DELIVERED THE PEOPLE FROM UNDER THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS

NOW I KNOW THAT THE LORD IS GREATER THAN ALL GODS BECAUSE IN THIS AFFAIR THEY DEALT ARROGANTLY WITH THE PEOPLE

 AND JETHRO MOSES' FATHERINLAW BROUGHT A BURNT OFFERING AND SACRIFICES TO GOD; AND AARON CAME WITH ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL TO EAT BREAD WITH MOSES' FATHERINLAW BEFORE GOD

THE NEXT DAY MOSES SAT TO JUDGE THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE STOOD AROUND MOSES FROM MORNING TILL EVENING

WHEN MOSES' FATHERINLAW SAW ALL THAT HE WAS DOING FOR THE PEOPLE HE SAID WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU ARE DOING FOR THE PEOPLE

WHY DO YOU SIT ALONE AND ALL THE PEOPLE STAND AROUND YOU FROM MORNING TILL EVENING

 AND MOSES SAID TO HIS FATHERINLAW BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COME TO ME TO INQUIRE OF GOD; WHEN THEY HAVE A DISPUTE THEY COME TO ME AND I DECIDE BETWEEN ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER AND I MAKE THEM KNOW THE STATUTES OF GOD AND HIS LAWS

 MOSES' FATHERINLAW SAID TO HIM WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS NOT GOOD

YOU AND THE PEOPLE WITH YOU WILL CERTAINLY WEAR YOURSELVES OUT FOR THE THING IS TOO HEAVY FOR YOU

YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IT ALONE

NOW OBEY MY VOICE; I WILL GIVE YOU ADVICE AND GOD BE WITH YOU

YOU SHALL REPRESENT THE PEOPLE BEFORE GOD AND BRING THEIR CASES TO GOD AND YOU SHALL WARN THEM ABOUT THE STATUTES AND THE LAWS AND MAKE THEM KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH THEY MUST WALK AND WHAT THEY MUST DO

MOREOVER LOOK FOR ABLE MEN FROM ALL THE PEOPLE MEN WHO FEAR GOD WHO ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND HATE A BRIBE AND PLACE SUCH MEN OVER THE PEOPLE AS CHIEFS OF THOUSANDS OF HUNDREDS OF FIFTIES AND OF TENS

AND LET THEM JUDGE THE PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES

EVERY GREAT MATTER THEY SHALL BRING TO YOU BUT ANY SMALL MATTER THEY SHALL DECIDE THEMSELVES

SO IT WILL BE EASIER FOR YOU AND THEY WILL BEAR THE BURDEN WITH YOU

IF YOU DO THIS GOD WILL DIRECT YOU YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ENDURE AND ALL THIS PEOPLE ALSO WILL GO TO THEIR PLACE IN PEACE

 SO MOSES LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF HIS FATHERINLAW AND DID ALL THAT HE HAD SAID

MOSES CHOSE ABLE MEN OUT OF ALL ISRAEL AND MADE THEM HEADS OVER THE PEOPLE CHIEFS OF THOUSANDS OF HUNDREDS OF FIFTIES AND OF TENS

AND THEY JUDGED THE PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES

ANY HARD CASE THEY BROUGHT TO MOSES BUT ANY SMALL MATTER THEY DECIDED THEMSELVES

THEN MOSES LET HIS FATHERINLAW DEPART AND HE WENT AWAY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY

ON THE THIRD NEW MOON AFTER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD GONE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT ON THAT DAY THEY CAME INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI

THEY SET OUT FROM REPHIDIM AND CAME INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI AND THEY ENCAMPED IN THE WILDERNESS

THERE ISRAEL ENCAMPED BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN WHILE MOSES WENT UP TO GOD

THE LORD CALLED TO HIM OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN SAYING THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB AND TELL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL YOU YOURSELVES HAVE SEEN WHAT I DID TO THE EGYPTIANS AND HOW I BORE YOU ON EAGLES' WINGS AND BROUGHT YOU TO MYSELF

NOW THEREFORE IF YOU WILL INDEED OBEY MY VOICE AND KEEP MY COVENANT YOU SHALL BE MY TREASURED POSSESSION AMONG ALL PEOPLES FOR ALL THE EARTH IS MINE; AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME A KINGDOM OF PRIESTS AND A HOLY NATION

THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT YOU SHALL SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 SO MOSES CAME AND CALLED THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE AND SET BEFORE THEM ALL THESE WORDS THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED HIM

ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED TOGETHER AND SAID ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL DO

 AND MOSES REPORTED THE WORDS OF THE PEOPLE TO THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD I AM COMING TO YOU IN A THICK CLOUD THAT THE PEOPLE MAY HEAR WHEN I SPEAK WITH YOU AND MAY ALSO BELIEVE YOU FOREVER

WHEN MOSES TOLD THE WORDS OF THE PEOPLE TO THE LORD THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO TO THE PEOPLE AND CONSECRATE THEM TODAY AND TOMORROW AND LET THEM WASH THEIR GARMENTS AND BE READY FOR THE THIRD DAY

FOR ON THE THIRD DAY THE LORD WILL COME DOWN ON MOUNT SINAI IN THE SIGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE

AND YOU SHALL SET LIMITS FOR THE PEOPLE ALL AROUND SAYING 'TAKE CARE NOT TO GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN OR TOUCH THE EDGE OF IT

WHOEVER TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM BUT HE SHALL BE STONED OR SHOT; WHETHER BEAST OR MAN HE SHALL NOT LIVE

' WHEN THE TRUMPET SOUNDS A LONG BLAST THEY SHALL COME UP TO THE MOUNTAIN

 SO MOSES WENT DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN TO THE PEOPLE AND CONSECRATED THE PEOPLE; AND THEY WASHED THEIR GARMENTS

AND HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE BE READY FOR THE THIRD DAY; DO NOT GO NEAR A WOMAN

 ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY THERE WERE THUNDERS AND LIGHTNINGS AND A THICK CLOUD ON THE MOUNTAIN AND A VERY LOUD TRUMPET BLAST SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMP TREMBLED

THEN MOSES BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CAMP TO MEET GOD AND THEY TOOK THEIR STAND AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN

NOW MOUNT SINAI WAS WRAPPED IN SMOKE BECAUSE THE LORD HAD DESCENDED ON IT IN FIRE

THE SMOKE OF IT WENT UP LIKE THE SMOKE OF A KILN AND THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN TREMBLED GREATLY

AND AS THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER MOSES SPOKE AND GOD ANSWERED HIM IN THUNDER

THE LORD CAME DOWN ON MOUNT SINAI TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

AND THE LORD CALLED MOSES TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND MOSES WENT UP

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO DOWN AND WARN THE PEOPLE LEST THEY BREAK THROUGH TO THE LORD TO LOOK AND MANY OF THEM PERISH

ALSO LET THE PRIESTS WHO COME NEAR TO THE LORD CONSECRATE THEMSELVES LEST THE LORD BREAK OUT AGAINST THEM

 AND MOSES SAID TO THE LORD THE PEOPLE CANNOT COME UP TO MOUNT SINAI FOR YOU YOURSELF WARNED US SAYING 'SET LIMITS AROUND THE MOUNTAIN AND CONSECRATE IT

' AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM GO DOWN AND COME UP BRINGING AARON WITH YOU

BUT DO NOT LET THE PRIESTS AND THE PEOPLE BREAK THROUGH TO COME UP TO THE LORD LEST HE BREAK OUT AGAINST THEM

 SO MOSES WENT DOWN TO THE PEOPLE AND TOLD THEM

YOU SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH BECAUSE IT IS HOLY FOR YOU

EVERYONE WHO PROFANES IT SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

WHOEVER DOES ANY WORK ON IT THAT SOUL SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG HIS PEOPLE

SIX DAYS SHALL WORK BE DONE BUT THE SEVENTH DAY IS A SABBATH OF SOLEMN REST HOLY TO THE LORD

WHOEVER DOES ANY WORK ON THE SABBATH DAY SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

THEREFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH OBSERVING THE SABBATH THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS AS A COVENANT FOREVER

IT IS A SIGN FOREVER BETWEEN ME AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE RESTED AND WAS REFRESHED

' AND HE GAVE TO MOSES WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING WITH HIM ON MOUNT SINAI THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY TABLETS OF STONE WRITTEN WITH THE FINGER OF GOD

WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW THAT MOSES DELAYED TO COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN THE PEOPLE GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER TO AARON AND SAID TO HIM UP MAKE US GODS WHO SHALL GO BEFORE US

AS FOR THIS MOSES THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM

 SO AARON SAID TO THEM TAKE OFF THE RINGS OF GOLD THAT ARE IN THE EARS OF YOUR WIVES YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS AND BRING THEM TO ME

 SO ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK OFF THE RINGS OF GOLD THAT WERE IN THEIR EARS AND BROUGHT THEM TO AARON

AND HE RECEIVED THE GOLD FROM THEIR HAND AND FASHIONED IT WITH A GRAVING TOOL AND MADE A GOLDEN CALF

AND THEY SAID THESE ARE YOUR GODS O ISRAEL WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

 WHEN AARON SAW THIS HE BUILT AN ALTAR BEFORE IT

AND AARON MADE PROCLAMATION AND SAID TOMORROW SHALL BE A FEAST TO THE LORD

 AND THEY ROSE UP EARLY THE NEXT DAY AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND BROUGHT PEACE OFFERINGS

AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK AND ROSE UP TO PLAY

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GO DOWN FOR YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU BROUGHT UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT HAVE CORRUPTED THEMSELVES

THEY HAVE TURNED ASIDE QUICKLY OUT OF THE WAY THAT I COMMANDED THEM

THEY HAVE MADE FOR THEMSELVES A GOLDEN CALF AND HAVE WORSHIPED IT AND SACRIFICED TO IT AND SAID 'THESE ARE YOUR GODS O ISRAEL WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

' AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES I HAVE SEEN THIS PEOPLE AND BEHOLD IT IS A STIFFNECKED PEOPLE

NOW THEREFORE LET ME ALONE THAT MY WRATH MAY BURN HOT AGAINST THEM AND I MAY CONSUME THEM IN ORDER THAT I MAY MAKE A GREAT NATION OF YOU

 BUT MOSES IMPLORED THE LORD HIS GOD AND SAID O LORD WHY DOES YOUR WRATH BURN HOT AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WITH GREAT POWER AND WITH A MIGHTY HAND

WHY SHOULD THE EGYPTIANS SAY 'WITH EVIL INTENT DID HE BRING THEM OUT TO KILL THEM IN THE MOUNTAINS AND TO CONSUME THEM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH'

TURN FROM YOUR BURNING ANGER AND RELENT FROM THIS DISASTER AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE

REMEMBER ABRAHAM ISAAC AND ISRAEL YOUR SERVANTS TO WHOM YOU SWORE BY YOUR OWN SELF AND SAID TO THEM 'I WILL MULTIPLY YOUR OFFSPRING AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND ALL THIS LAND THAT I HAVE PROMISED I WILL GIVE TO YOUR OFFSPRING AND THEY SHALL INHERIT IT FOREVER

' AND THE LORD RELENTED FROM THE DISASTER THAT HE HAD SPOKEN OF BRINGING ON HIS PEOPLE

THEN MOSES TURNED AND WENT DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY IN HIS HAND TABLETS THAT WERE WRITTEN ON BOTH SIDES; ON THE FRONT AND ON THE BACK THEY WERE WRITTEN

THE TABLETS WERE THE WORK OF GOD AND THE WRITING WAS THE WRITING OF GOD ENGRAVED ON THE TABLETS

WHEN JOSHUA HEARD THE NOISE OF THE PEOPLE AS THEY SHOUTED HE SAID TO MOSES THERE IS A NOISE OF WAR IN THE CAMP

 BUT HE SAID IT IS NOT THE SOUND OF SHOUTING FOR VICTORY OR THE SOUND OF THE CRY OF DEFEAT BUT THE SOUND OF SINGING THAT I HEAR

 AND AS SOON AS HE CAME NEAR THE CAMP AND SAW THE CALF AND THE DANCING MOSES' ANGER BURNED HOT AND HE THREW THE TABLETS OUT OF HIS HANDS AND BROKE THEM AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN

HE TOOK THE CALF THAT THEY HAD MADE AND BURNED IT WITH FIRE AND GROUND IT TO POWDER AND SCATTERED IT ON THE WATER AND MADE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DRINK IT

AND MOSES SAID TO AARON WHAT DID THIS PEOPLE DO TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT SUCH A GREAT SIN UPON THEM

 AND AARON SAID LET NOT THE ANGER OF MY LORD BURN HOT

YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE SET ON EVIL

FOR THEY SAID TO ME 'MAKE US GODS WHO SHALL GO BEFORE US

AS FOR THIS MOSES THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM

' SO I SAID TO THEM 'LET ANY WHO HAVE GOLD TAKE IT OFF

' SO THEY GAVE IT TO ME AND I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE AND OUT CAME THIS CALF

 AND WHEN MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE HAD BROKEN LOOSE FOR AARON HAD LET THEM BREAK LOOSE TO THE DERISION OF THEIR ENEMIES THEN MOSES STOOD IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP AND SAID WHO IS ON THE LORD'S SIDE

COME TO ME

 AND ALL THE SONS OF LEVI GATHERED AROUND HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL 'PUT YOUR SWORD ON YOUR SIDE EACH OF YOU AND GO TO AND FRO FROM GATE TO GATE THROUGHOUT THE CAMP AND EACH OF YOU KILL HIS BROTHER AND HIS COMPANION AND HIS NEIGHBOR

' AND THE SONS OF LEVI DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES

AND THAT DAY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEN OF THE PEOPLE FELL

AND MOSES SAID TODAY YOU HAVE BEEN ORDAINED FOR THE SERVICE OF THE LORD EACH ONE AT THE COST OF HIS SON AND OF HIS BROTHER SO THAT HE MIGHT BESTOW A BLESSING UPON YOU THIS DAY

 THE NEXT DAY MOSES SAID TO THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE SINNED A GREAT SIN

AND NOW I WILL GO UP TO THE LORD; PERHAPS I CAN MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SIN

 SO MOSES RETURNED TO THE LORD AND SAID ALAS THIS PEOPLE HAVE SINNED A GREAT SIN

THEY HAVE MADE FOR THEMSELVES GODS OF GOLD

BUT NOW IF YOU WILL FORGIVE THEIR SINBUT IF NOT PLEASE BLOT ME OUT OF YOUR BOOK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES WHOEVER HAS SINNED AGAINST ME I WILL BLOT OUT OF MY BOOK

BUT NOW GO LEAD THE PEOPLE TO THE PLACE ABOUT WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU; BEHOLD MY ANGEL SHALL GO BEFORE YOU

NEVERTHELESS IN THE DAY WHEN I VISIT I WILL VISIT THEIR SIN UPON THEM

 THEN THE LORD SENT A PLAGUE ON THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY MADE THE CALF THE ONE THAT AARON MADE

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES DEPART; GO UP FROM HERE YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO THE LAND OF WHICH I SWORE TO ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB SAYING 'TO YOUR OFFSPRING I WILL GIVE IT

' I WILL SEND AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU AND I WILL DRIVE OUT THE CANAANITES THE AMORITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES

GO UP TO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY; BUT I WILL NOT GO UP AMONG YOU LEST I CONSUME YOU ON THE WAY FOR YOU ARE A STIFFNECKED PEOPLE

 WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS DISASTROUS WORD THEY MOURNED AND NO ONE PUT ON HIS ORNAMENTS

FOR THE LORD HAD SAID TO MOSES SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'YOU ARE A STIFFNECKED PEOPLE; IF FOR A SINGLE MOMENT I SHOULD GO UP AMONG YOU I WOULD CONSUME YOU

SO NOW TAKE OFF YOUR ORNAMENTS THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU

' THEREFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF THEIR ORNAMENTS FROM MOUNT HOREB ONWARD

NOW MOSES USED TO TAKE THE TENT AND PITCH IT OUTSIDE THE CAMP FAR OFF FROM THE CAMP AND HE CALLED IT THE TENT OF MEETING

AND EVERYONE WHO SOUGHT THE LORD WOULD GO OUT TO THE TENT OF MEETING WHICH WAS OUTSIDE THE CAMP

WHENEVER MOSES WENT OUT TO THE TENT ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE UP AND EACH WOULD STAND AT HIS TENT DOOR AND WATCH MOSES UNTIL HE HAD GONE INTO THE TENT

WHEN MOSES ENTERED THE TENT THE PILLAR OF CLOUD WOULD DESCEND AND STAND AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT AND THE LORD WOULD SPEAK WITH MOSES

AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE PILLAR OF CLOUD STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE UP AND WORSHIP EACH AT HIS TENT DOOR

THUS THE LORD USED TO SPEAK TO MOSES FACE TO FACE AS A MAN SPEAKS TO HIS FRIEND

WHEN MOSES TURNED AGAIN INTO THE CAMP HIS ASSISTANT JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN A YOUNG MAN WOULD NOT DEPART FROM THE TENT

MOSES SAID TO THE LORD SEE YOU SAY TO ME 'BRING UP THIS PEOPLE' BUT YOU HAVE NOT LET ME KNOW WHOM YOU WILL SEND WITH ME

YET YOU HAVE SAID 'I KNOW YOU BY NAME AND YOU HAVE ALSO FOUND FAVOR IN MY SIGHT

' NOW THEREFORE IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT PLEASE SHOW ME NOW YOUR WAYS THAT I MAY KNOW YOU IN ORDER TO FIND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT

CONSIDER TOO THAT THIS NATION IS YOUR PEOPLE

 AND HE SAID MY PRESENCE WILL GO WITH YOU AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST

 AND HE SAID TO HIM IF YOUR PRESENCE WILL NOT GO WITH ME DO NOT BRING US UP FROM HERE

FOR HOW SHALL IT BE KNOWN THAT I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT I AND YOUR PEOPLE

IS IT NOT IN YOUR GOING WITH US SO THAT WE ARE DISTINCT I AND YOUR PEOPLE FROM EVERY OTHER PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES THIS VERY THING THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN I WILL DO FOR YOU HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN MY SIGHT AND I KNOW YOU BY NAME

 MOSES SAID PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR GLORY

 AND HE SAID I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE YOU AND WILL PROCLAIM BEFORE YOU MY NAME 'THE LORD

' AND I WILL BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS AND WILL SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW MERCY

BUT HE SAID YOU CANNOT SEE MY FACE FOR MAN SHALL NOT SEE ME AND LIVE

 AND THE LORD SAID BEHOLD THERE IS A PLACE BY ME WHERE YOU SHALL STAND ON THE ROCK AND WHILE MY GLORY PASSES BY I WILL PUT YOU IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK AND I WILL COVER YOU WITH MY HAND UNTIL I HAVE PASSED BY

THEN I WILL TAKE AWAY MY HAND AND YOU SHALL SEE MY BACK BUT MY FACE SHALL NOT BE SEEN

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES CUT FOR YOURSELF TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST AND I WILL WRITE ON THE TABLETS THE WORDS THAT WERE ON THE FIRST TABLETS WHICH YOU BROKE

BE READY BY THE MORNING AND COME UP IN THE MORNING TO MOUNT SINAI AND PRESENT YOURSELF THERE TO ME ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

NO ONE SHALL COME UP WITH YOU AND LET NO ONE BE SEEN THROUGHOUT ALL THE MOUNTAIN

LET NO FLOCKS OR HERDS GRAZE OPPOSITE THAT MOUNTAIN

 SO MOSES CUT TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST

AND HE ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WENT UP ON MOUNT SINAI AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED HIM AND TOOK IN HIS HAND TWO TABLETS OF STONE

THE LORD DESCENDED IN THE CLOUD AND STOOD WITH HIM THERE AND PROCLAIMED THE NAME OF THE LORD

THE LORD PASSED BEFORE HIM AND PROCLAIMED THE LORD THE LORD A GOD MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS KEEPING STEADFAST LOVE FOR THOUSANDS FORGIVING INIQUITY AND TRANSGRESSION AND SIN BUT WHO WILL BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS ON THE CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION

 AND MOSES QUICKLY BOWED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE EARTH AND WORSHIPED

AND HE SAID IF NOW I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT O LORD PLEASE LET THE LORD GO IN THE MIDST OF US FOR IT IS A STIFFNECKED PEOPLE AND PARDON OUR INIQUITY AND OUR SIN AND TAKE US FOR YOUR INHERITANCE

 AND HE SAID BEHOLD I AM MAKING A COVENANT

BEFORE ALL YOUR PEOPLE I WILL DO MARVELS SUCH AS HAVE NOT BEEN CREATED IN ALL THE EARTH OR IN ANY NATION

AND ALL THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM YOU ARE SHALL SEE THE WORK OF THE LORD FOR IT IS AN AWESOME THING THAT I WILL DO WITH YOU

OBSERVE WHAT I COMMAND YOU THIS DAY

BEHOLD I WILL DRIVE OUT BEFORE YOU THE AMORITES THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES

TAKE CARE LEST YOU MAKE A COVENANT WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND TO WHICH YOU GO LEST IT BECOME A SNARE IN YOUR MIDST

YOU SHALL TEAR DOWN THEIR ALTARS AND BREAK THEIR PILLARS AND CUT DOWN THEIR ASHERIM FOR YOU SHALL WORSHIP NO OTHER GOD FOR THE LORD WHOSE NAME IS JEALOUS IS A JEALOUS GOD LEST YOU MAKE A COVENANT WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND AND WHEN THEY WHORE AFTER THEIR GODS AND SACRIFICE TO THEIR GODS AND YOU ARE INVITED YOU EAT OF HIS SACRIFICE AND YOU TAKE OF THEIR DAUGHTERS FOR YOUR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS WHORE AFTER THEIR GODS AND MAKE YOUR SONS WHORE AFTER THEIR GODS

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF ANY GODS OF CAST METAL

YOU SHALL KEEP THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD

SEVEN DAYS YOU SHALL EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD AS I COMMANDED YOU AT THE TIME APPOINTED IN THE MONTH ABIB FOR IN THE MONTH ABIB YOU CAME OUT FROM EGYPT

ALL THAT OPEN THE WOMB ARE MINE ALL YOUR MALE LIVESTOCK THE FIRSTBORN OF COW AND SHEEP

THE FIRSTBORN OF A DONKEY YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB OR IF YOU WILL NOT REDEEM IT YOU SHALL BREAK ITS NECK

ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF YOUR SONS YOU SHALL REDEEM

AND NONE SHALL APPEAR BEFORE ME EMPTYHANDED

SIX DAYS YOU SHALL WORK BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY YOU SHALL REST

IN PLOWING TIME AND IN HARVEST YOU SHALL REST

YOU SHALL OBSERVE THE FEAST OF WEEKS THE FIRSTFRUITS OF WHEAT HARVEST AND THE FEAST OF INGATHERING AT THE YEAR'S END

THREE TIMES IN THE YEAR SHALL ALL YOUR MALES APPEAR BEFORE THE LORD GOD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

FOR I WILL CAST OUT NATIONS BEFORE YOU AND ENLARGE YOUR BORDERS; NO ONE SHALL COVET YOUR LAND WHEN YOU GO UP TO APPEAR BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD THREE TIMES IN THE YEAR

YOU SHALL NOT OFFER THE BLOOD OF MY SACRIFICE WITH ANYTHING LEAVENED OR LET THE SACRIFICE OF THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER REMAIN UNTIL THE MORNING

THE BEST OF THE FIRSTFRUITS OF YOUR GROUND YOU SHALL BRING TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

YOU SHALL NOT BOIL A YOUNG GOAT IN ITS MOTHER'S MILK

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES WRITE THESE WORDS FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE WORDS I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH YOU AND WITH ISRAEL

 SO HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS

HE NEITHER ATE BREAD NOR DRANK WATER

AND HE WROTE ON THE TABLETS THE WORDS OF THE COVENANT THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

WHEN MOSES CAME DOWN FROM MOUNT SINAI WITH THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY IN HIS HAND AS HE CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE SHONE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH GOD

AARON AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAW MOSES AND BEHOLD THE SKIN OF HIS FACE SHONE AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO COME NEAR HIM

BUT MOSES CALLED TO THEM AND AARON AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE CONGREGATION RETURNED TO HIM AND MOSES TALKED WITH THEM

AFTERWARD ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME NEAR AND HE COMMANDED THEM ALL THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM IN MOUNT SINAI

AND WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED SPEAKING WITH THEM HE PUT A VEIL OVER HIS FACE

WHENEVER MOSES WENT IN BEFORE THE LORD TO SPEAK WITH HIM HE WOULD REMOVE THE VEIL UNTIL HE CAME OUT

AND WHEN HE CAME OUT AND TOLD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHAT HE WAS COMMANDED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WOULD SEE THE FACE OF MOSES THAT THE SKIN OF MOSES' FACE WAS SHINING

AND MOSES WOULD PUT THE VEIL OVER HIS FACE AGAIN UNTIL HE WENT IN TO SPEAK WITH HIM

MOSES ASSEMBLED ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND SAID TO THEM THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED YOU TO DO

JEREMIAHTHE WORDS OF JEREMIAH THE SON OF HILKIAH ONE OF THE PRIESTS WHO WERE IN ANATHOTH IN THE LAND OF BENJAMIN TO WHOM THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME IN THE DAYS OF JOSIAH THE SON OF AMON KING OF JUDAH IN THE THIRTEENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN

IT CAME ALSO IN THE DAYS OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH AND UNTIL THE END OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH UNTIL THE CAPTIVITY OF JERUSALEM IN THE FIFTH MONTH

NOW THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING BEFORE I FORMED YOU IN THE WOMB I KNEW YOU AND BEFORE YOU WERE BORN I CONSECRATED YOU; I APPOINTED YOU A PROPHET TO THE NATIONS

 THEN I SAID AH LORD GOD

BEHOLD I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK FOR I AM ONLY A YOUTH

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO ME DO NOT SAY 'I AM ONLY A YOUTH'; FOR TO ALL TO WHOM I SEND YOU YOU SHALL GO AND WHATEVER I COMMAND YOU YOU SHALL SPEAK

DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM FOR I AM WITH YOU TO DELIVER YOU DECLARES THE LORD

 THEN THE LORD PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED MY MOUTH

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME BEHOLD I HAVE PUT MY WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH

SEE I HAVE SET YOU THIS DAY OVER NATIONS AND OVER KINGDOMS TO PLUCK UP AND TO BREAK DOWN TO DESTROY AND TO OVERTHROW TO BUILD AND TO PLANT

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING JEREMIAH WHAT DO YOU SEE

 AND I SAID I SEE AN ALMOND BRANCH

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME YOU HAVE SEEN WELL FOR I AM WATCHING OVER MY WORD TO PERFORM IT

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME A SECOND TIME SAYING WHAT DO YOU SEE

 AND I SAID I SEE A BOILING POT FACING AWAY FROM THE NORTH

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME OUT OF THE NORTH DISASTER SHALL BE LET LOOSE UPON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

FOR BEHOLD I AM CALLING ALL THE TRIBES OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH DECLARES THE LORD AND THEY SHALL COME AND EVERY ONE SHALL SET HIS THRONE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATES OF JERUSALEM AGAINST ALL ITS WALLS ALL AROUND AND AGAINST ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH

AND I WILL DECLARE MY JUDGMENTS AGAINST THEM FOR ALL THEIR EVIL IN FORSAKING ME

THEY HAVE MADE OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS AND WORSHIPED THE WORKS OF THEIR OWN HANDS

BUT YOU DRESS YOURSELF FOR WORK; ARISE AND SAY TO THEM EVERYTHING THAT I COMMAND YOU

DO NOT BE DISMAYED BY THEM LEST I DISMAY YOU BEFORE THEM

AND I BEHOLD I MAKE YOU THIS DAY A FORTIFIED CITY AN IRON PILLAR AND BRONZE WALLS AGAINST THE WHOLE LAND AGAINST THE KINGS OF JUDAH ITS OFFICIALS ITS PRIESTS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

THEY WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU BUT THEY SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST YOU FOR I AM WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD TO DELIVER YOU

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING GO AND PROCLAIM IN THE HEARING OF JERUSALEM THUS SAYS THE LORD I REMEMBER THE DEVOTION OF YOUR YOUTH YOUR LOVE AS A BRIDE HOW YOU FOLLOWED ME IN THE WILDERNESS IN A LAND NOT SOWN

ISRAEL WAS HOLY TO THE LORD THE FIRSTFRUITS OF HIS HARVEST

ALL WHO ATE OF IT INCURRED GUILT; DISASTER CAME UPON THEM DECLARES THE LORD

 HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O HOUSE OF JACOB AND ALL THE CLANS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THUS SAYS THE LORD WHAT WRONG DID YOUR FATHERS FIND IN ME THAT THEY WENT FAR FROM ME AND WENT AFTER WORTHLESSNESS AND BECAME WORTHLESS

THEY DID NOT SAY 'WHERE IS THE LORD WHO BROUGHT US UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT WHO LED US IN THE WILDERNESS IN A LAND OF DESERTS AND PITS IN A LAND OF DROUGHT AND DEEP DARKNESS IN A LAND THAT NONE PASSES THROUGH WHERE NO MAN DWELLS

' AND I BROUGHT YOU INTO A PLENTIFUL LAND TO ENJOY ITS FRUITS AND ITS GOOD THINGS

BUT WHEN YOU CAME IN YOU DEFILED MY LAND AND MADE MY HERITAGE AN ABOMINATION

THE PRIESTS DID NOT SAY 'WHERE IS THE LORD

' THOSE WHO HANDLE THE LAW DID NOT KNOW ME; THE SHEPHERDS TRANSGRESSED AGAINST ME; THE PROPHETS PROPHESIED BY BAAL AND WENT AFTER THINGS THAT DO NOT PROFIT

THEREFORE I STILL CONTEND WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD AND WITH YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN I WILL CONTEND

FOR CROSS TO THE COASTS OF CYPRUS AND SEE OR SEND TO KEDAR AND EXAMINE WITH CARE; SEE IF THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A THING

HAS A NATION CHANGED ITS GODS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NO GODS

BUT MY PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED THEIR GLORY FOR THAT WHICH DOES NOT PROFIT

BE APPALLED O HEAVENS AT THIS; BE SHOCKED BE UTTERLY DESOLATE DECLARES THE LORD FOR MY PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED TWO EVILS THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS AND HEWED OUT CISTERNS FOR THEMSELVES BROKEN CISTERNS THAT CAN HOLD NO WATER

IS ISRAEL A SLAVE

IS HE A HOMEBORN SERVANT

WHY THEN HAS HE BECOME A PREY

THE LIONS HAVE ROARED AGAINST HIM; THEY HAVE ROARED LOUDLY

THEY HAVE MADE HIS LAND A WASTE; HIS CITIES ARE IN RUINS WITHOUT INHABITANT

MOREOVER THE MEN OF MEMPHIS AND TAHPANHES HAVE SHAVED THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD

HAVE YOU NOT BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF BY FORSAKING THE LORD YOUR GOD WHEN HE LED YOU IN THE WAY

AND NOW WHAT DO YOU GAIN BY GOING TO EGYPT TO DRINK THE WATERS OF THE NILE

OR WHAT DO YOU GAIN BY GOING TO ASSYRIA TO DRINK THE WATERS OF THE EUPHRATES

YOUR EVIL WILL CHASTISE YOU AND YOUR APOSTASY WILL REPROVE YOU

KNOW AND SEE THAT IT IS EVIL AND BITTER FOR YOU TO FORSAKE THE LORD YOUR GOD; THE FEAR OF ME IS NOT IN YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS

FOR LONG AGO I BROKE YOUR YOKE AND BURST YOUR BONDS; BUT YOU SAID 'I WILL NOT SERVE

' YES ON EVERY HIGH HILL AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE YOU BOWED DOWN LIKE A WHORE

YET I PLANTED YOU A CHOICE VINE WHOLLY OF PURE SEED

HOW THEN HAVE YOU TURNED DEGENERATE AND BECOME A WILD VINE

THOUGH YOU WASH YOURSELF WITH LYE AND USE MUCH SOAP THE STAIN OF YOUR GUILT IS STILL BEFORE ME DECLARES THE LORD GOD

HOW CAN YOU SAY 'I AM NOT UNCLEAN I HAVE NOT GONE AFTER THE BAALS'

LOOK AT YOUR WAY IN THE VALLEY; KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONEA RESTLESS YOUNG CAMEL RUNNING HERE AND THERE A WILD DONKEY USED TO THE WILDERNESS IN HER HEAT SNIFFING THE WIND

WHO CAN RESTRAIN HER LUST

NONE WHO SEEK HER NEED WEARY THEMSELVES; IN HER MONTH THEY WILL FIND HER

KEEP YOUR FEET FROM GOING UNSHOD AND YOUR THROAT FROM THIRST

BUT YOU SAID 'IT IS HOPELESS FOR I HAVE LOVED FOREIGNERS AND AFTER THEM I WILL GO

' AS A THIEF IS SHAMED WHEN CAUGHT SO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE SHAMED THEY THEIR KINGS THEIR OFFICIALS THEIR PRIESTS AND THEIR PROPHETS WHO SAY TO A TREE 'YOU ARE MY FATHER' AND TO A STONE 'YOU GAVE ME BIRTH

' FOR THEY HAVE TURNED THEIR BACK TO ME AND NOT THEIR FACE

BUT IN THE TIME OF THEIR TROUBLE THEY SAY 'ARISE AND SAVE US

' BUT WHERE ARE YOUR GODS THAT YOU MADE FOR YOURSELF

LET THEM ARISE IF THEY CAN SAVE YOU IN YOUR TIME OF TROUBLE; FOR AS MANY AS YOUR CITIES ARE YOUR GODS O JUDAH

WHY DO YOU CONTEND WITH ME

YOU HAVE ALL TRANSGRESSED AGAINST ME DECLARES THE LORD

IN VAIN HAVE I STRUCK YOUR CHILDREN; THEY TOOK NO CORRECTION; YOUR OWN SWORD DEVOURED YOUR PROPHETS LIKE A RAVENING LION

AND YOU O GENERATION BEHOLD THE WORD OF THE LORD

HAVE I BEEN A WILDERNESS TO ISRAEL OR A LAND OF THICK DARKNESS

WHY THEN DO MY PEOPLE SAY 'WE ARE FREE WE WILL COME NO MORE TO YOU'

CAN A VIRGIN FORGET HER ORNAMENTS OR A BRIDE HER ATTIRE

YET MY PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN ME DAYS WITHOUT NUMBER

HOW WELL YOU DIRECT YOUR COURSE TO SEEK LOVE

SO THAT EVEN TO WICKED WOMEN YOU HAVE TAUGHT YOUR WAYS

ALSO ON YOUR SKIRTS IS FOUND THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE GUILTLESS POOR; YOU DID NOT FIND THEM BREAKING IN

YET IN SPITE OF ALL THESE THINGS YOU SAY 'I AM INNOCENT; SURELY HIS ANGER HAS TURNED FROM ME

' BEHOLD I WILL BRING YOU TO JUDGMENT FOR SAYING 'I HAVE NOT SINNED

' HOW MUCH YOU GO ABOUT CHANGING YOUR WAY

YOU SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME BY EGYPT AS YOU WERE PUT TO SHAME BY ASSYRIA

FROM IT TOO YOU WILL COME AWAY WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD FOR THE LORD HAS REJECTED THOSE IN WHOM YOU TRUST AND YOU WILL NOT PROSPER BY THEM

IF A MAN DIVORCES HIS WIFE AND SHE GOES FROM HIM AND BECOMES ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE WILL HE RETURN TO HER

WOULD NOT THAT LAND BE GREATLY POLLUTED

YOU HAVE PLAYED THE WHORE WITH MANY LOVERS; AND WOULD YOU RETURN TO ME

DECLARES THE LORD

LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO THE BARE HEIGHTS AND SEE

WHERE HAVE YOU NOT BEEN RAVISHED

BY THE WAYSIDES YOU HAVE SAT AWAITING LOVERS LIKE AN ARAB IN THE WILDERNESS

YOU HAVE POLLUTED THE LAND WITH YOUR VILE WHOREDOM

THEREFORE THE SHOWERS HAVE BEEN WITHHELD AND THE SPRING RAIN HAS NOT COME; YET YOU HAVE THE FOREHEAD OF A WHORE; YOU REFUSE TO BE ASHAMED

HAVE YOU NOT JUST NOW CALLED TO ME 'MY FATHER YOU ARE THE FRIEND OF MY YOUTH WILL HE BE ANGRY FOREVER WILL HE BE INDIGNANT TO THE END

' BEHOLD YOU HAVE SPOKEN BUT YOU HAVE DONE ALL THE EVIL THAT YOU COULD

 THE LORD SAID TO ME IN THE DAYS OF KING JOSIAH HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT SHE DID THAT FAITHLESS ONE ISRAEL HOW SHE WENT UP ON EVERY HIGH HILL AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE AND THERE PLAYED THE WHORE

AND I THOUGHT 'AFTER SHE HAS DONE ALL THIS SHE WILL RETURN TO ME' BUT SHE DID NOT RETURN AND HER TREACHEROUS SISTER JUDAH SAW IT

SHE SAW THAT FOR ALL THE ADULTERIES OF THAT FAITHLESS ONE ISRAEL I HAD SENT HER AWAY WITH A DECREE OF DIVORCE

YET HER TREACHEROUS SISTER JUDAH DID NOT FEAR BUT SHE TOO WENT AND PLAYED THE WHORE

BECAUSE SHE TOOK HER WHOREDOM LIGHTLY SHE POLLUTED THE LAND COMMITTING ADULTERY WITH STONE AND TREE

YET FOR ALL THIS HER TREACHEROUS SISTER JUDAH DID NOT RETURN TO ME WITH HER WHOLE HEART BUT IN PRETENSE DECLARES THE LORD

 AND THE LORD SAID TO ME FAITHLESS ISRAEL HAS SHOWN HERSELF MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN TREACHEROUS JUDAH

GO AND PROCLAIM THESE WORDS TOWARD THE NORTH AND SAY 'RETURN FAITHLESS ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL NOT LOOK ON YOU IN ANGER FOR I AM MERCIFUL DECLARES THE LORD; I WILL NOT BE ANGRY FOREVER

ONLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR GUILT THAT YOU REBELLED AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SCATTERED YOUR FAVORS AMONG FOREIGNERS UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE DECLARES THE LORD

RETURN O FAITHLESS CHILDREN DECLARES THE LORD; FOR I AM YOUR MASTER; I WILL TAKE YOU ONE FROM A CITY AND TWO FROM A FAMILY AND I WILL BRING YOU TO ZION

'AND I WILL GIVE YOU SHEPHERDS AFTER MY OWN HEART WHO WILL FEED YOU WITH KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING

AND WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLIED AND INCREASED IN THE LAND IN THOSE DAYS DECLARES THE LORD THEY SHALL NO MORE SAY THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD

 IT SHALL NOT COME TO MIND OR BE REMEMBERED OR MISSED; IT SHALL NOT BE MADE AGAIN

AT THAT TIME JERUSALEM SHALL BE CALLED THE THRONE OF THE LORD AND ALL NATIONS SHALL GATHER TO IT TO THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD IN JERUSALEM AND THEY SHALL NO MORE STUBBORNLY FOLLOW THEIR OWN EVIL HEART

IN THOSE DAYS THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL JOIN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND TOGETHER THEY SHALL COME FROM THE LAND OF THE NORTH TO THE LAND THAT I GAVE YOUR FATHERS FOR A HERITAGE

'I SAID HOW I WOULD SET YOU AMONG MY SONS AND GIVE YOU A PLEASANT LAND A HERITAGE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL NATIONS

AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD CALL ME MY FATHER AND WOULD NOT TURN FROM FOLLOWING ME

SURELY AS A TREACHEROUS WIFE LEAVES HER HUSBAND SO HAVE YOU BEEN TREACHEROUS TO ME O HOUSE OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD

' A VOICE ON THE BARE HEIGHTS IS HEARD THE WEEPING AND PLEADING OF ISRAEL'S SONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE PERVERTED THEIR WAY; THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE LORD THEIR GOD

RETURN O FAITHLESS SONS; I WILL HEAL YOUR FAITHLESSNESS

BEHOLD WE COME TO YOU FOR YOU ARE THE LORD OUR GOD

TRULY THE HILLS ARE A DELUSION THE ORGIES ON THE MOUNTAINS

TRULY IN THE LORD OUR GOD IS THE SALVATION OF ISRAEL

BUT FROM OUR YOUTH THE SHAMEFUL THING HAS DEVOURED ALL FOR WHICH OUR FATHERS LABORED THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR HERDS THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS

LET US LIE DOWN IN OUR SHAME AND LET OUR DISHONOR COVER US

FOR WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD OUR GOD WE AND OUR FATHERS FROM OUR YOUTH EVEN TO THIS DAY AND WE HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD

IF YOU RETURN O ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD TO ME YOU SHOULD RETURN

IF YOU REMOVE YOUR DETESTABLE THINGS FROM MY PRESENCE AND DO NOT WAVER AND IF YOU SWEAR 'AS THE LORD LIVES' IN TRUTH IN JUSTICE AND IN RIGHTEOUSNESS THEN NATIONS SHALL BLESS THEMSELVES IN HIM AND IN HIM SHALL THEY GLORY

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD TO THE MEN OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM BREAK UP YOUR FALLOW GROUND AND SOW NOT AMONG THORNS

CIRCUMCISE YOURSELVES TO THE LORD; REMOVE THE FORESKIN OF YOUR HEARTS O MEN OF JUDAH AND INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM; LEST MY WRATH GO FORTH LIKE FIRE AND BURN WITH NONE TO QUENCH IT BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF YOUR DEEDS

 DECLARE IN JUDAH AND PROCLAIM IN JERUSALEM AND SAY BLOW THE TRUMPET THROUGH THE LAND; CRY ALOUD AND SAY 'ASSEMBLE AND LET US GO INTO THE FORTIFIED CITIES

' RAISE A STANDARD TOWARD ZION FLEE FOR SAFETY STAY NOT FOR I BRING DISASTER FROM THE NORTH AND GREAT DESTRUCTION

A LION HAS GONE UP FROM HIS THICKET A DESTROYER OF NATIONS HAS SET OUT; HE HAS GONE OUT FROM HIS PLACE TO MAKE YOUR LAND A WASTE; YOUR CITIES WILL BE RUINS WITHOUT INHABITANT

FOR THIS PUT ON SACKCLOTH LAMENT AND WAIL FOR THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD HAS NOT TURNED BACK FROM US

 IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD COURAGE SHALL FAIL BOTH KING AND OFFICIALS

THE PRIESTS SHALL BE APPALLED AND THE PROPHETS ASTOUNDED

 THEN I SAID AH LORD GOD SURELY YOU HAVE UTTERLY DECEIVED THIS PEOPLE AND JERUSALEM SAYING 'IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU' WHEREAS THE SWORD HAS REACHED THEIR VERY LIFE

 AT THAT TIME IT WILL BE SAID TO THIS PEOPLE AND TO JERUSALEM A HOT WIND FROM THE BARE HEIGHTS IN THE DESERT TOWARD THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE NOT TO WINNOW OR CLEANSE A WIND TOO FULL FOR THIS COMES FOR ME

NOW IT IS I WHO SPEAK IN JUDGMENT UPON THEM

 BEHOLD HE COMES UP LIKE CLOUDS; HIS CHARIOTS LIKE THE WHIRLWIND; HIS HORSES ARE SWIFTER THAN EAGLESWOE TO US FOR WE ARE RUINED

O JERUSALEM WASH YOUR HEART FROM EVIL THAT YOU MAY BE SAVED

HOW LONG SHALL YOUR WICKED THOUGHTS LODGE WITHIN YOU

FOR A VOICE DECLARES FROM DAN AND PROCLAIMS TROUBLE FROM MOUNT EPHRAIM

WARN THE NATIONS THAT HE IS COMING; ANNOUNCE TO JERUSALEM BESIEGERS COME FROM A DISTANT LAND; THEY SHOUT AGAINST THE CITIES OF JUDAH

LIKE KEEPERS OF A FIELD ARE THEY AGAINST HER ALL AROUND BECAUSE SHE HAS REBELLED AGAINST ME DECLARES THE LORD

YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOU

THIS IS YOUR DOOM AND IT IS BITTER; IT HAS REACHED YOUR VERY HEART

 MY ANGUISH MY ANGUISH

I WRITHE IN PAIN

OH THE WALLS OF MY HEART

MY HEART IS BEATING WILDLY; I CANNOT KEEP SILENT FOR I HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THE ALARM OF WAR

CRASH FOLLOWS HARD ON CRASH; THE WHOLE LAND IS LAID WASTE

SUDDENLY MY TENTS ARE LAID WASTE MY CURTAINS IN A MOMENT

HOW LONG MUST I SEE THE STANDARD AND HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET

FOR MY PEOPLE ARE FOOLISH; THEY KNOW ME NOT; THEY ARE STUPID CHILDREN; THEY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING

THEY ARE 'WISE'IN DOING EVIL

BUT HOW TO DO GOOD THEY KNOW NOT

 I LOOKED ON THE EARTH AND BEHOLD IT WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID; AND TO THE HEAVENS AND THEY HAD NO LIGHT

I LOOKED ON THE MOUNTAINS AND BEHOLD THEY WERE QUAKING AND ALL THE HILLS MOVED TO AND FRO

I LOOKED AND BEHOLD THERE WAS NO MAN AND ALL THE BIRDS OF THE AIR HAD FLED

I LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE FRUITFUL LAND WAS A DESERT AND ALL ITS CITIES WERE LAID IN RUINS BEFORE THE LORD BEFORE HIS FIERCE ANGER

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD THE WHOLE LAND SHALL BE A DESOLATION; YET I WILL NOT MAKE A FULL END

FOR THIS THE EARTH SHALL MOURN AND THE HEAVENS ABOVE BE DARK; FOR I HAVE SPOKEN; I HAVE PURPOSED; I HAVE NOT RELENTED NOR WILL I TURN BACK

 AT THE NOISE OF HORSEMAN AND ARCHER EVERY CITY TAKES TO FLIGHT; THEY ENTER THICKETS; THEY CLIMB AMONG ROCKS; ALL THE CITIES ARE FORSAKEN AND NO MAN DWELLS IN THEM

AND YOU O DESOLATE ONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU DRESS IN SCARLET THAT YOU ADORN YOURSELF WITH ORNAMENTS OF GOLD THAT YOU ENLARGE YOUR EYES WITH PAINT

IN VAIN YOU BEAUTIFY YOURSELF

YOUR LOVERS DESPISE YOU; THEY SEEK YOUR LIFE

FOR I HEARD A CRY AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR ANGUISH AS OF ONE GIVING BIRTH TO HER FIRST CHILD THE CRY OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION GASPING FOR BREATH STRETCHING OUT HER HANDS WOE IS ME

I AM FAINTING BEFORE MURDERERS

RUN TO AND FRO THROUGH THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM LOOK AND TAKE NOTE

SEARCH HER SQUARES TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A MAN ONE WHO DOES JUSTICE AND SEEKS TRUTH THAT I MAY PARDON HER

THOUGH THEY SAY AS THE LORD LIVES YET THEY SWEAR FALSELY

O LORD DO NOT YOUR EYES LOOK FOR TRUTH

YOU HAVE STRUCK THEM DOWN BUT THEY FELT NO ANGUISH; YOU HAVE CONSUMED THEM BUT THEY REFUSED TO TAKE CORRECTION

THEY HAVE MADE THEIR FACES HARDER THAN ROCK; THEY HAVE REFUSED TO REPENT

THEN I SAID THESE ARE ONLY THE POOR; THEY HAVE NO SENSE; FOR THEY DO NOT KNOW THE WAY OF THE LORD THE JUSTICE OF THEIR GOD

I WILL GO TO THE GREAT AND WILL SPEAK TO THEM FOR THEY KNOW THE WAY OF THE LORD THE JUSTICE OF THEIR GOD

 BUT THEY ALL ALIKE HAD BROKEN THE YOKE; THEY HAD BURST THE BONDS

THEREFORE A LION FROM THE FOREST SHALL STRIKE THEM DOWN; A WOLF FROM THE DESERT SHALL DEVASTATE THEM

A LEOPARD IS WATCHING THEIR CITIES; EVERYONE WHO GOES OUT OF THEM SHALL BE TORN IN PIECES BECAUSE THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS ARE MANY THEIR APOSTASIES ARE GREAT

HOW CAN I PARDON YOU

YOUR CHILDREN HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND HAVE SWORN BY THOSE WHO ARE NO GODS

WHEN I FED THEM TO THE FULL THEY COMMITTED ADULTERY AND TROOPED TO THE HOUSES OF WHORES

THEY WERE WELLFED LUSTY STALLIONS EACH NEIGHING FOR HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE

SHALL I NOT PUNISH THEM FOR THESE THINGS

DECLARES THE LORD; AND SHALL I NOT AVENGE MYSELF ON A NATION SUCH AS THIS

GO UP THROUGH HER VINE ROWS AND DESTROY BUT MAKE NOT A FULL END; STRIP AWAY HER BRANCHES FOR THEY ARE NOT THE LORD'S

FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH HAVE BEEN UTTERLY TREACHEROUS TO ME DECLARES THE LORD

THEY HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY OF THE LORD AND HAVE SAID 'HE WILL DO NOTHING; NO DISASTER WILL COME UPON US NOR SHALL WE SEE SWORD OR FAMINE

THE PROPHETS WILL BECOME WIND; THE WORD IS NOT IN THEM

THUS SHALL IT BE DONE TO THEM

' THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPOKEN THIS WORD BEHOLD I AM MAKING MY WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH A FIRE AND THIS PEOPLE WOOD AND THE FIRE SHALL CONSUME THEM

BEHOLD I AM BRINGING AGAINST YOU A NATION FROM AFAR O HOUSE OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD

IT IS AN ENDURING NATION; IT IS AN ANCIENT NATION A NATION WHOSE LANGUAGE YOU DO NOT KNOW NOR CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAY

THEIR QUIVER IS LIKE AN OPEN TOMB; THEY ARE ALL MIGHTY WARRIORS

THEY SHALL EAT UP YOUR HARVEST AND YOUR FOOD; THEY SHALL EAT UP YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS; THEY SHALL EAT UP YOUR FLOCKS AND YOUR HERDS; THEY SHALL EAT UP YOUR VINES AND YOUR FIG TREES; YOUR FORTIFIED CITIES IN WHICH YOU TRUST THEY SHALL BEAT DOWN WITH THE SWORD

 BUT EVEN IN THOSE DAYS DECLARES THE LORD I WILL NOT MAKE A FULL END OF YOU

AND WHEN YOUR PEOPLE SAY 'WHY HAS THE LORD OUR GOD DONE ALL THESE THINGS TO US

' YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'AS YOU HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND SERVED FOREIGN GODS IN YOUR LAND SO YOU SHALL SERVE FOREIGNERS IN A LAND THAT IS NOT YOURS

' DECLARE THIS IN THE HOUSE OF JACOB; PROCLAIM IT IN JUDAH HEAR THIS O FOOLISH AND SENSELESS PEOPLE WHO HAVE EYES BUT SEE NOT WHO HAVE EARS BUT HEAR NOT

DO YOU NOT FEAR ME

DECLARES THE LORD; DO YOU NOT TREMBLE BEFORE ME

I PLACED THE SAND AS THE BOUNDARY FOR THE SEA A PERPETUAL BARRIER THAT IT CANNOT PASS; THOUGH THE WAVES TOSS THEY CANNOT PREVAIL; THOUGH THEY ROAR THEY CANNOT PASS OVER IT

BUT THIS PEOPLE HAS A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS HEART; THEY HAVE TURNED ASIDE AND GONE AWAY

THEY DO NOT SAY IN THEIR HEARTS 'LET US FEAR THE LORD OUR GOD WHO GIVES THE RAIN IN ITS SEASON THE AUTUMN RAIN AND THE SPRING RAIN AND KEEPS FOR US THE WEEKS APPOINTED FOR THE HARVEST

' YOUR INIQUITIES HAVE TURNED THESE AWAY AND YOUR SINS HAVE KEPT GOOD FROM YOU

FOR WICKED MEN ARE FOUND AMONG MY PEOPLE; THEY LURK LIKE FOWLERS LYING IN WAIT

THEY SET A TRAP; THEY CATCH MEN

LIKE A CAGE FULL OF BIRDS THEIR HOUSES ARE FULL OF DECEIT; THEREFORE THEY HAVE BECOME GREAT AND RICH; THEY HAVE GROWN FAT AND SLEEK

THEY KNOW NO BOUNDS IN DEEDS OF EVIL; THEY JUDGE NOT WITH JUSTICE THE CAUSE OF THE FATHERLESS TO MAKE IT PROSPER AND THEY DO NOT DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE NEEDY

SHALL I NOT PUNISH THEM FOR THESE THINGS

DECLARES THE LORD AND SHALL I NOT AVENGE MYSELF ON A NATION SUCH AS THIS

 AN APPALLING AND HORRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAND THE PROPHETS PROPHESY FALSELY AND THE PRIESTS RULE AT THEIR DIRECTION; MY PEOPLE LOVE TO HAVE IT SO BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THE END COMES

FLEE FOR SAFETY O PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN FROM THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM

BLOW THE TRUMPET IN TEKOA AND RAISE A SIGNAL ON BETHHACCHEREM FOR DISASTER LOOMS OUT OF THE NORTH AND GREAT DESTRUCTION

THE LOVELY AND DELICATELY BRED I WILL DESTROY THE DAUGHTER OF ZION

SHEPHERDS WITH THEIR FLOCKS SHALL COME AGAINST HER; THEY SHALL PITCH THEIR TENTS AROUND HER; THEY SHALL PASTURE EACH IN HIS PLACE

PREPARE WAR AGAINST HER; ARISE AND LET US ATTACK AT NOON

WOE TO US FOR THE DAY DECLINES FOR THE SHADOWS OF EVENING LENGTHEN

ARISE AND LET US ATTACK BY NIGHT AND DESTROY HER PALACES

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CUT DOWN HER TREES; CAST UP A SIEGE MOUND AGAINST JERUSALEM

THIS IS THE CITY THAT MUST BE PUNISHED; THERE IS NOTHING BUT OPPRESSION WITHIN HER

AS A WELL KEEPS ITS WATER FRESH SO SHE KEEPS FRESH HER EVIL; VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION ARE HEARD WITHIN HER; SICKNESS AND WOUNDS ARE EVER BEFORE ME

BE WARNED O JERUSALEM LEST I TURN FROM YOU IN DISGUST LEST I MAKE YOU A DESOLATION AN UNINHABITED LAND

 THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THEY SHALL GLEAN THOROUGHLY AS A VINE THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL; LIKE A GRAPEGATHERER PASS YOUR HAND AGAIN OVER ITS BRANCHES

 TO WHOM SHALL I SPEAK AND GIVE WARNING THAT THEY MAY HEAR

BEHOLD THEIR EARS ARE UNCIRCUMCISED THEY CANNOT LISTEN; BEHOLD THE WORD OF THE LORD IS TO THEM AN OBJECT OF SCORN; THEY TAKE NO PLEASURE IN IT

THEREFORE I AM FULL OF THE WRATH OF THE LORD; I AM WEARY OF HOLDING IT IN

POUR IT OUT UPON THE CHILDREN IN THE STREET AND UPON THE GATHERINGS OF YOUNG MEN ALSO; BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE SHALL BE TAKEN THE ELDERLY AND THE VERY AGED

THEIR HOUSES SHALL BE TURNED OVER TO OTHERS THEIR FIELDS AND WIVES TOGETHER FOR I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND DECLARES THE LORD

FOR FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM EVERYONE IS GREEDY FOR UNJUST GAIN; AND FROM PROPHET TO PRIEST EVERYONE DEALS FALSELY

THEY HAVE HEALED THE WOUND OF MY PEOPLE LIGHTLY SAYING 'PEACE PEACE' WHEN THERE IS NO PEACE

WERE THEY ASHAMED WHEN THEY COMMITTED ABOMINATION

NO THEY WERE NOT AT ALL ASHAMED; THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BLUSH

THEREFORE THEY SHALL FALL AMONG THOSE WHO FALL; AT THE TIME THAT I PUNISH THEM THEY SHALL BE OVERTHROWN SAYS THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD STAND BY THE ROADS AND LOOK AND ASK FOR THE ANCIENT PATHS WHERE THE GOOD WAY IS; AND WALK IN IT AND FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS

BUT THEY SAID 'WE WILL NOT WALK IN IT

' I SET WATCHMEN OVER YOU SAYING 'PAY ATTENTION TO THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET

' BUT THEY SAID 'WE WILL NOT PAY ATTENTION

' THEREFORE HEAR O NATIONS AND KNOW O CONGREGATION WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM

HEAR O EARTH; BEHOLD I AM BRINGING DISASTER UPON THIS PEOPLE THE FRUIT OF THEIR DEVICES BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT PAID ATTENTION TO MY WORDS; AND AS FOR MY LAW THEY HAVE REJECTED IT

WHAT USE TO ME IS FRANKINCENSE THAT COMES FROM SHEBA OR SWEET CANE FROM A DISTANT LAND

YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE NOR YOUR SACRIFICES PLEASING TO ME

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BEHOLD I WILL LAY BEFORE THIS PEOPLE STUMBLING BLOCKS AGAINST WHICH THEY SHALL STUMBLE; FATHERS AND SONS TOGETHER NEIGHBOR AND FRIEND SHALL PERISH

' THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD A PEOPLE IS COMING FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY A GREAT NATION IS STIRRING FROM THE FARTHEST PARTS OF THE EARTH

THEY LAY HOLD ON BOW AND JAVELIN; THEY ARE CRUEL AND HAVE NO MERCY; THE SOUND OF THEM IS LIKE THE ROARING SEA; THEY RIDE ON HORSES SET IN ARRAY AS A MAN FOR BATTLE AGAINST YOU O DAUGHTER OF ZION

 WE HAVE HEARD THE REPORT OF IT; OUR HANDS FALL HELPLESS; ANGUISH HAS TAKEN HOLD OF US PAIN AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

GO NOT OUT INTO THE FIELD NOR WALK ON THE ROAD FOR THE ENEMY HAS A SWORD; TERROR IS ON EVERY SIDE

O DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND ROLL IN ASHES; MAKE MOURNING AS FOR AN ONLY SON MOST BITTER LAMENTATION FOR SUDDENLY THE DESTROYER WILL COME UPON US

I HAVE MADE YOU A TESTER OF METALS AMONG MY PEOPLE THAT YOU MAY KNOW AND TEST THEIR WAYS

THEY ARE ALL STUBBORNLY REBELLIOUS GOING ABOUT WITH SLANDERS; THEY ARE BRONZE AND IRON; ALL OF THEM ACT CORRUPTLY

THE BELLOWS BLOW FIERCELY; THE LEAD IS CONSUMED BY THE FIRE; IN VAIN THE REFINING GOES ON FOR THE WICKED ARE NOT REMOVED

REJECTED SILVER THEY ARE CALLED FOR THE LORD HAS REJECTED THEM

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD STAND IN THE GATE OF THE LORD'S HOUSE AND PROCLAIM THERE THIS WORD AND SAY HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD ALL YOU MEN OF JUDAH WHO ENTER THESE GATES TO WORSHIP THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL AMEND YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS AND I WILL LET YOU DWELL IN THIS PLACE

DO NOT TRUST IN THESE DECEPTIVE WORDS 'THIS IS THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

' FOR IF YOU TRULY AMEND YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS IF YOU TRULY EXECUTE JUSTICE ONE WITH ANOTHER IF YOU DO NOT OPPRESS THE SOJOURNER THE FATHERLESS OR THE WIDOW OR SHED INNOCENT BLOOD IN THIS PLACE AND IF YOU DO NOT GO AFTER OTHER GODS TO YOUR OWN HARM THEN I WILL LET YOU DWELL IN THIS PLACE IN THE LAND THAT I GAVE OF OLD TO YOUR FATHERS FOREVER

BEHOLD YOU TRUST IN DECEPTIVE WORDS TO NO AVAIL

WILL YOU STEAL MURDER COMMIT ADULTERY SWEAR FALSELY MAKE OFFERINGS TO BAAL AND GO AFTER OTHER GODS THAT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN AND THEN COME AND STAND BEFORE ME IN THIS HOUSE WHICH IS CALLED BY MY NAME AND SAY 'WE ARE DELIVERED

'ONLY TO GO ON DOING ALL THESE ABOMINATIONS

HAS THIS HOUSE WHICH IS CALLED BY MY NAME BECOME A DEN OF ROBBERS IN YOUR EYES

BEHOLD I MYSELF HAVE SEEN IT DECLARES THE LORD

GO NOW TO MY PLACE THAT WAS IN SHILOH WHERE I MADE MY NAME DWELL AT FIRST AND SEE WHAT I DID TO IT BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS DECLARES THE LORD AND WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU PERSISTENTLY YOU DID NOT LISTEN AND WHEN I CALLED YOU YOU DID NOT ANSWER THEREFORE I WILL DO TO THE HOUSE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME AND IN WHICH YOU TRUST AND TO THE PLACE THAT I GAVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR FATHERS AS I DID TO SHILOH

AND I WILL CAST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT AS I CAST OUT ALL YOUR KINSMEN ALL THE OFFSPRING OF EPHRAIM

AS FOR YOU DO NOT PRAY FOR THIS PEOPLE OR LIFT UP A CRY OR PRAYER FOR THEM AND DO NOT INTERCEDE WITH ME FOR I WILL NOT HEAR YOU

DO YOU NOT SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM

THE CHILDREN GATHER WOOD THE FATHERS KINDLE FIRE AND THE WOMEN KNEAD DOUGH TO MAKE CAKES FOR THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN

AND THEY POUR OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS TO PROVOKE ME TO ANGER

IS IT I WHOM THEY PROVOKE

DECLARES THE LORD

IS IT NOT THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN SHAME

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD MY ANGER AND MY WRATH WILL BE POURED OUT ON THIS PLACE UPON MAN AND BEAST UPON THE TREES OF THE FIELD AND THE FRUIT OF THE GROUND; IT WILL BURN AND NOT BE QUENCHED

 THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL ADD YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS TO YOUR SACRIFICES AND EAT THE FLESH

FOR IN THE DAY THAT I BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT I DID NOT SPEAK TO YOUR FATHERS OR COMMAND THEM CONCERNING BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES

BUT THIS COMMAND I GAVE THEM 'OBEY MY VOICE AND I WILL BE YOUR GOD AND YOU SHALL BE MY PEOPLE

AND WALK IN ALL THE WAY THAT I COMMAND YOU THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU

' BUT THEY DID NOT OBEY OR INCLINE THEIR EAR BUT WALKED IN THEIR OWN COUNSELS AND THE STUBBORNNESS OF THEIR EVIL HEARTS AND WENT BACKWARD AND NOT FORWARD

FROM THE DAY THAT YOUR FATHERS CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO THIS DAY I HAVE PERSISTENTLY SENT ALL MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS TO THEM DAY AFTER DAY

YET THEY DID NOT LISTEN TO ME OR INCLINE THEIR EAR BUT STIFFENED THEIR NECK

THEY DID WORSE THAN THEIR FATHERS

SO YOU SHALL SPEAK ALL THESE WORDS TO THEM BUT THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU

YOU SHALL CALL TO THEM BUT THEY WILL NOT ANSWER YOU

AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THIS IS THE NATION THAT DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD THEIR GOD AND DID NOT ACCEPT DISCIPLINE; TRUTH HAS PERISHED; IT IS CUT OFF FROM THEIR LIPS

'CUT OFF YOUR HAIR AND CAST IT AWAY; RAISE A LAMENTATION ON THE BARE HEIGHTS FOR THE LORD HAS REJECTED AND FORSAKEN THE GENERATION OF HIS WRATH

' FOR THE SONS OF JUDAH HAVE DONE EVIL IN MY SIGHT DECLARES THE LORD

THEY HAVE SET THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS IN THE HOUSE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME TO DEFILE IT

AND THEY HAVE BUILT THE HIGH PLACES OF TOPHETH WHICH IS IN THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM TO BURN THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN THE FIRE WHICH I DID NOT COMMAND NOR DID IT COME INTO MY MIND

THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN IT WILL NO MORE BE CALLED TOPHETH OR THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM BUT THE VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER; FOR THEY WILL BURY IN TOPHETH BECAUSE THERE IS NO ROOM ELSEWHERE

AND THE DEAD BODIES OF THIS PEOPLE WILL BE FOOD FOR THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND FOR THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH AND NONE WILL FRIGHTEN THEM AWAY

AND I WILL SILENCE IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM THE VOICE OF MIRTH AND THE VOICE OF GLADNESS THE VOICE OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE VOICE OF THE BRIDE FOR THE LAND SHALL BECOME A WASTE

AT THAT TIME DECLARES THE LORD THE BONES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH THE BONES OF ITS OFFICIALS THE BONES OF THE PRIESTS THE BONES OF THE PROPHETS AND THE BONES OF THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SHALL BE BROUGHT OUT OF THEIR TOMBS

AND THEY SHALL BE SPREAD BEFORE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN WHICH THEY HAVE LOVED AND SERVED WHICH THEY HAVE GONE AFTER AND WHICH THEY HAVE SOUGHT AND WORSHIPED

AND THEY SHALL NOT BE GATHERED OR BURIED

THEY SHALL BE AS DUNG ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND

DEATH SHALL BE PREFERRED TO LIFE BY ALL THE REMNANT THAT REMAINS OF THIS EVIL FAMILY IN ALL THE PLACES WHERE I HAVE DRIVEN THEM DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD WHEN MEN FALL DO THEY NOT RISE AGAIN

IF ONE TURNS AWAY DOES HE NOT RETURN

WHY THEN HAS THIS PEOPLE TURNED AWAY IN PERPETUAL BACKSLIDING

THEY HOLD FAST TO DECEIT; THEY REFUSE TO RETURN

I HAVE PAID ATTENTION AND LISTENED BUT THEY HAVE NOT SPOKEN RIGHTLY; NO MAN RELENTS OF HIS EVIL SAYING 'WHAT HAVE I DONE

' EVERYONE TURNS TO HIS OWN COURSE LIKE A HORSE PLUNGING HEADLONG INTO BATTLE

EVEN THE STORK IN THE HEAVENS KNOWS HER TIMES AND THE TURTLEDOVE SWALLOW AND CRANE KEEP THE TIME OF THEIR COMING BUT MY PEOPLE KNOW NOT THE RULES OF THE LORD

HOW CAN YOU SAY 'WE ARE WISE AND THE LAW OF THE LORD IS WITH US'

BUT BEHOLD THE LYING PEN OF THE SCRIBES HAS MADE IT INTO A LIE

THE WISE MEN SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME; THEY SHALL BE DISMAYED AND TAKEN; BEHOLD THEY HAVE REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD SO WHAT WISDOM IS IN THEM

THEREFORE I WILL GIVE THEIR WIVES TO OTHERS AND THEIR FIELDS TO CONQUERORS BECAUSE FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST EVERYONE IS GREEDY FOR UNJUST GAIN; FROM PROPHET TO PRIEST EVERYONE DEALS FALSELY

THEY HAVE HEALED THE WOUND OF MY PEOPLE LIGHTLY SAYING 'PEACE PEACE' WHEN THERE IS NO PEACE

WERE THEY ASHAMED WHEN THEY COMMITTED ABOMINATION

NO THEY WERE NOT AT ALL ASHAMED; THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BLUSH

THEREFORE THEY SHALL FALL AMONG THE FALLEN; WHEN I PUNISH THEM THEY SHALL BE OVERTHROWN SAYS THE LORD

WHEN I WOULD GATHER THEM DECLARES THE LORD THERE ARE NO GRAPES ON THE VINE NOR FIGS ON THE FIG TREE; EVEN THE LEAVES ARE WITHERED AND WHAT I GAVE THEM HAS PASSED AWAY FROM THEM

 WHY DO WE SIT STILL

GATHER TOGETHER; LET US GO INTO THE FORTIFIED CITIES AND PERISH THERE FOR THE LORD OUR GOD HAS DOOMED US TO PERISH AND HAS GIVEN US POISONED WATER TO DRINK BECAUSE WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD

WE LOOKED FOR PEACE BUT NO GOOD CAME; FOR A TIME OF HEALING BUT BEHOLD TERROR

THE SNORTING OF THEIR HORSES IS HEARD FROM DAN; AT THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHING OF THEIR STALLIONS THE WHOLE LAND QUAKES

THEY COME AND DEVOUR THE LAND AND ALL THAT FILLS IT THE CITY AND THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT

FOR BEHOLD I AM SENDING AMONG YOU SERPENTS ADDERS THAT CANNOT BE CHARMED AND THEY SHALL BITE YOU DECLARES THE LORD

MY JOY IS GONE; GRIEF IS UPON ME; MY HEART IS SICK WITHIN ME

BEHOLD THE CRY OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE FROM THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE LAND IS THE LORD NOT IN ZION

IS HER KING NOT IN HER

WHY HAVE THEY PROVOKED ME TO ANGER WITH THEIR CARVED IMAGES AND WITH THEIR FOREIGN IDOLS

 THE HARVEST IS PAST THE SUMMER IS ENDED AND WE ARE NOT SAVED

 FOR THE WOUND OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE IS MY HEART WOUNDED; I MOURN AND DISMAY HAS TAKEN HOLD ON ME

IS THERE NO BALM IN GILEAD

IS THERE NO PHYSICIAN THERE

WHY THEN HAS THE HEALTH OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE NOT BEEN RESTORED

OH THAT MY HEAD WERE WATERS AND MY EYES A FOUNTAIN OF TEARS THAT I MIGHT WEEP DAY AND NIGHT FOR THE SLAIN OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE

OH THAT I HAD IN THE DESERT A TRAVELERS' LODGING PLACE THAT I MIGHT LEAVE MY PEOPLE AND GO AWAY FROM THEM

FOR THEY ARE ALL ADULTERERS A COMPANY OF TREACHEROUS MEN

THEY BEND THEIR TONGUE LIKE A BOW; FALSEHOOD AND NOT TRUTH HAS GROWN STRONG IN THE LAND; FOR THEY PROCEED FROM EVIL TO EVIL AND THEY DO NOT KNOW ME DECLARES THE LORD

LET EVERYONE BEWARE OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND PUT NO TRUST IN ANY BROTHER FOR EVERY BROTHER IS A DECEIVER AND EVERY NEIGHBOR GOES ABOUT AS A SLANDERER

EVERYONE DECEIVES HIS NEIGHBOR AND NO ONE SPEAKS THE TRUTH; THEY HAVE TAUGHT THEIR TONGUE TO SPEAK LIES; THEY WEARY THEMSELVES COMMITTING INIQUITY

HEAPING OPPRESSION UPON OPPRESSION AND DECEIT UPON DECEIT THEY REFUSE TO KNOW ME DECLARES THE LORD

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD I WILL REFINE THEM AND TEST THEM FOR WHAT ELSE CAN I DO BECAUSE OF MY PEOPLE

THEIR TONGUE IS A DEADLY ARROW; IT SPEAKS DECEITFULLY; WITH HIS MOUTH EACH SPEAKS PEACE TO HIS NEIGHBOR BUT IN HIS HEART HE PLANS AN AMBUSH FOR HIM

SHALL I NOT PUNISH THEM FOR THESE THINGS

DECLARES THE LORD AND SHALL I NOT AVENGE MYSELF ON A NATION SUCH AS THIS

I WILL TAKE UP WEEPING AND WAILING FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND A LAMENTATION FOR THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS BECAUSE THEY ARE LAID WASTE SO THAT NO ONE PASSES THROUGH AND THE LOWING OF CATTLE IS NOT HEARD; BOTH THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS HAVE FLED AND ARE GONE

I WILL MAKE JERUSALEM A HEAP OF RUINS A LAIR OF JACKALS AND I WILL MAKE THE CITIES OF JUDAH A DESOLATION WITHOUT INHABITANT

 WHO IS THE MAN SO WISE THAT HE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS

TO WHOM HAS THE MOUTH OF THE LORD SPOKEN THAT HE MAY DECLARE IT

WHY IS THE LAND RUINED AND LAID WASTE LIKE A WILDERNESS SO THAT NO ONE PASSES THROUGH

AND THE LORD SAYS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN MY LAW THAT I SET BEFORE THEM AND HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE OR WALKED IN ACCORD WITH IT BUT HAVE STUBBORNLY FOLLOWED THEIR OWN HEARTS AND HAVE GONE AFTER THE BAALS AS THEIR FATHERS TAUGHT THEM

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL FEED THIS PEOPLE WITH BITTER FOOD AND GIVE THEM POISONOUS WATER TO DRINK

I WILL SCATTER THEM AMONG THE NATIONS WHOM NEITHER THEY NOR THEIR FATHERS HAVE KNOWN AND I WILL SEND THE SWORD AFTER THEM UNTIL I HAVE CONSUMED THEM

 THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CONSIDER AND CALL FOR THE MOURNING WOMEN TO COME; SEND FOR THE SKILLFUL WOMEN TO COME; LET THEM MAKE HASTE AND RAISE A WAILING OVER US THAT OUR EYES MAY RUN DOWN WITH TEARS AND OUR EYELIDS FLOW WITH WATER

FOR A SOUND OF WAILING IS HEARD FROM ZION 'HOW WE ARE RUINED

WE ARE UTTERLY SHAMED BECAUSE WE HAVE LEFT THE LAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAST DOWN OUR DWELLINGS

' HEAR O WOMEN THE WORD OF THE LORD AND LET YOUR EAR RECEIVE THE WORD OF HIS MOUTH; TEACH TO YOUR DAUGHTERS A LAMENT AND EACH TO HER NEIGHBOR A DIRGE

FOR DEATH HAS COME UP INTO OUR WINDOWS; IT HAS ENTERED OUR PALACES CUTTING OFF THE CHILDREN FROM THE STREETS AND THE YOUNG MEN FROM THE SQUARES

SPEAK THUS DECLARES THE LORD 'THE DEAD BODIES OF MEN SHALL FALL LIKE DUNG UPON THE OPEN FIELD LIKE SHEAVES AFTER THE REAPER AND NONE SHALL GATHER THEM

' THUS SAYS THE LORD LET NOT THE WISE MAN BOAST IN HIS WISDOM LET NOT THE MIGHTY MAN BOAST IN HIS MIGHT LET NOT THE RICH MAN BOAST IN HIS RICHES BUT LET HIM WHO BOASTS BOAST IN THIS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS AND KNOWS ME THAT I AM THE LORD WHO PRACTICES STEADFAST LOVE JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE EARTH

FOR IN THESE THINGS I DELIGHT DECLARES THE LORD

 BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL PUNISH ALL THOSE WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED MERELY IN THE FLESH EGYPT JUDAH EDOM THE SONS OF AMMON MOAB AND ALL WHO DWELL IN THE DESERT WHO CUT THE CORNERS OF THEIR HAIR FOR ALL THESE NATIONS ARE UNCIRCUMCISED AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL IS UNCIRCUMCISED IN HEART

HEAR THE WORD THAT THE LORD SPEAKS TO YOU O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THUS SAYS THE LORD LEARN NOT THE WAY OF THE NATIONS NOR BE DISMAYED AT THE SIGNS OF THE HEAVENS BECAUSE THE NATIONS ARE DISMAYED AT THEM FOR THE CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLES ARE VANITY

A TREE FROM THE FOREST IS CUT DOWN AND WORKED WITH AN AXE BY THE HANDS OF A CRAFTSMAN

THEY DECORATE IT WITH SILVER AND GOLD; THEY FASTEN IT WITH HAMMER AND NAILS SO THAT IT CANNOT MOVE

THEIR IDOLS ARE LIKE SCARECROWS IN A CUCUMBER FIELD AND THEY CANNOT SPEAK; THEY HAVE TO BE CARRIED FOR THEY CANNOT WALK

DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM FOR THEY CANNOT DO EVIL NEITHER IS IT IN THEM TO DO GOOD

 THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU O LORD; YOU ARE GREAT AND YOUR NAME IS GREAT IN MIGHT

WHO WOULD NOT FEAR YOU O KING OF THE NATIONS

FOR THIS IS YOUR DUE; FOR AMONG ALL THE WISE ONES OF THE NATIONS AND IN ALL THEIR KINGDOMS THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU

THEY ARE BOTH STUPID AND FOOLISH; THE INSTRUCTION OF IDOLS IS BUT WOOD

BEATEN SILVER IS BROUGHT FROM TARSHISH AND GOLD FROM UPHAZ

THEY ARE THE WORK OF THE CRAFTSMAN AND OF THE HANDS OF THE GOLDSMITH; THEIR CLOTHING IS VIOLET AND PURPLE; THEY ARE ALL THE WORK OF SKILLED MEN

BUT THE LORD IS THE TRUE GOD; HE IS THE LIVING GOD AND THE EVERLASTING KING

AT HIS WRATH THE EARTH QUAKES AND THE NATIONS CANNOT ENDURE HIS INDIGNATION

THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THEM THE GODS WHO DID NOT MAKE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH SHALL PERISH FROM THE EARTH AND FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS

 IT IS HE WHO MADE THE EARTH BY HIS POWER WHO ESTABLISHED THE WORLD BY HIS WISDOM AND BY HIS UNDERSTANDING STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS

WHEN HE UTTERS HIS VOICE THERE IS A TUMULT OF WATERS IN THE HEAVENS AND HE MAKES THE MIST RISE FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

HE MAKES LIGHTNING FOR THE RAIN AND HE BRINGS FORTH THE WIND FROM HIS STOREHOUSES

EVERY MAN IS STUPID AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE; EVERY GOLDSMITH IS PUT TO SHAME BY HIS IDOLS FOR HIS IMAGES ARE FALSE AND THERE IS NO BREATH IN THEM

THEY ARE WORTHLESS A WORK OF DELUSION; AT THE TIME OF THEIR PUNISHMENT THEY SHALL PERISH

NOT LIKE THESE IS HE WHO IS THE PORTION OF JACOB FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO FORMED ALL THINGS AND ISRAEL IS THE TRIBE OF HIS INHERITANCE; THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME

GATHER UP YOUR BUNDLE FROM THE GROUND O YOU WHO DWELL UNDER SIEGE

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM SLINGING OUT THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND AT THIS TIME AND I WILL BRING DISTRESS ON THEM THAT THEY MAY FEEL IT

 WOE IS ME BECAUSE OF MY HURT

MY WOUND IS GRIEVOUS

BUT I SAID TRULY THIS IS AN AFFLICTION AND I MUST BEAR IT

 MY TENT IS DESTROYED AND ALL MY CORDS ARE BROKEN; MY CHILDREN HAVE GONE FROM ME AND THEY ARE NOT; THERE IS NO ONE TO SPREAD MY TENT AGAIN AND TO SET UP MY CURTAINS

FOR THE SHEPHERDS ARE STUPID AND DO NOT INQUIRE OF THE LORD; THEREFORE THEY HAVE NOT PROSPERED AND ALL THEIR FLOCK IS SCATTERED

A VOICE A RUMOR

BEHOLD IT COMES

A GREAT COMMOTION OUT OF THE NORTH COUNTRY TO MAKE THE CITIES OF JUDAH A DESOLATION A LAIR OF JACKALS

I KNOW O LORD THAT THE WAY OF MAN IS NOT IN HIMSELF THAT IT IS NOT IN MAN WHO WALKS TO DIRECT HIS STEPS

CORRECT ME O LORD BUT IN JUSTICE; NOT IN YOUR ANGER LEST YOU BRING ME TO NOTHING

POUR OUT YOUR WRATH ON THE NATIONS THAT KNOW YOU NOT AND ON THE PEOPLES THAT CALL NOT ON YOUR NAME FOR THEY HAVE DEVOURED JACOB; THEY HAVE DEVOURED HIM AND CONSUMED HIM AND HAVE LAID WASTE HIS HABITATION

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT AND SPEAK TO THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL CURSED BE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT THAT I COMMANDED YOUR FATHERS WHEN I BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT FROM THE IRON FURNACE SAYING LISTEN TO MY VOICE AND DO ALL THAT I COMMAND YOU

SO SHALL YOU BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE YOUR GOD THAT I MAY CONFIRM THE OATH THAT I SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY AS AT THIS DAY

 THEN I ANSWERED SO BE IT LORD

 AND THE LORD SAID TO ME PROCLAIM ALL THESE WORDS IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT AND DO THEM

FOR I SOLEMNLY WARNED YOUR FATHERS WHEN I BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WARNING THEM PERSISTENTLY EVEN TO THIS DAY SAYING OBEY MY VOICE

YET THEY DID NOT OBEY OR INCLINE THEIR EAR BUT EVERYONE WALKED IN THE STUBBORNNESS OF HIS EVIL HEART

THEREFORE I BROUGHT UPON THEM ALL THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT WHICH I COMMANDED THEM TO DO BUT THEY DID NOT

 AGAIN THE LORD SAID TO ME A CONSPIRACY EXISTS AMONG THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

THEY HAVE TURNED BACK TO THE INIQUITIES OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHO REFUSED TO HEAR MY WORDS

THEY HAVE GONE AFTER OTHER GODS TO SERVE THEM

THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH HAVE BROKEN MY COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM BRINGING DISASTER UPON THEM THAT THEY CANNOT ESCAPE

THOUGH THEY CRY TO ME I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEM

THEN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM WILL GO AND CRY TO THE GODS TO WHOM THEY MAKE OFFERINGS BUT THEY CANNOT SAVE THEM IN THE TIME OF THEIR TROUBLE

FOR YOUR GODS HAVE BECOME AS MANY AS YOUR CITIES O JUDAH AND AS MANY AS THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM ARE THE ALTARS YOU HAVE SET UP TO SHAME ALTARS TO MAKE OFFERINGS TO BAAL

THEREFORE DO NOT PRAY FOR THIS PEOPLE OR LIFT UP A CRY OR PRAYER ON THEIR BEHALF FOR I WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR TROUBLE

WHAT RIGHT HAS MY BELOVED IN MY HOUSE WHEN SHE HAS DONE MANY VILE DEEDS

CAN EVEN SACRIFICIAL FLESH AVERT YOUR DOOM

CAN YOU THEN EXULT

THE LORD ONCE CALLED YOU 'A GREEN OLIVE TREE BEAUTIFUL WITH GOOD FRUIT

' BUT WITH THE ROAR OF A GREAT TEMPEST HE WILL SET FIRE TO IT AND ITS BRANCHES WILL BE CONSUMED

THE LORD OF HOSTS WHO PLANTED YOU HAS DECREED DISASTER AGAINST YOU BECAUSE OF THE EVIL THAT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH HAVE DONE PROVOKING ME TO ANGER BY MAKING OFFERINGS TO BAAL

 THE LORD MADE IT KNOWN TO ME AND I KNEW; THEN YOU SHOWED ME THEIR DEEDS

BUT I WAS LIKE A GENTLE LAMB LED TO THE SLAUGHTER

I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS AGAINST ME THEY DEVISED SCHEMES SAYING LET US DESTROY THE TREE WITH ITS FRUIT LET US CUT HIM OFF FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING THAT HIS NAME BE REMEMBERED NO MORE

 BUT O LORD OF HOSTS WHO JUDGES RIGHTEOUSLY WHO TESTS THE HEART AND THE MIND LET ME SEE YOUR VENGEANCE UPON THEM FOR TO YOU HAVE I COMMITTED MY CAUSE

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE MEN OF ANATHOTH WHO SEEK YOUR LIFE AND SAY DO NOT PROPHESY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OR YOU WILL DIE BY OUR HAND THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD I WILL PUNISH THEM

THE YOUNG MEN SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS SHALL DIE BY FAMINE AND NONE OF THEM SHALL BE LEFT

FOR I WILL BRING DISASTER UPON THE MEN OF ANATHOTH THE YEAR OF THEIR PUNISHMENT

RIGHTEOUS ARE YOU O LORD WHEN I COMPLAIN TO YOU; YET I WOULD PLEAD MY CASE BEFORE YOU

WHY DOES THE WAY OF THE WICKED PROSPER

WHY DO ALL WHO ARE TREACHEROUS THRIVE

YOU PLANT THEM AND THEY TAKE ROOT; THEY GROW AND PRODUCE FRUIT; YOU ARE NEAR IN THEIR MOUTH AND FAR FROM THEIR HEART

BUT YOU O LORD KNOW ME; YOU SEE ME AND TEST MY HEART TOWARD YOU

PULL THEM OUT LIKE SHEEP FOR THE SLAUGHTER AND SET THEM APART FOR THE DAY OF SLAUGHTER

HOW LONG WILL THE LAND MOURN AND THE GRASS OF EVERY FIELD WITHER

FOR THE EVIL OF THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT THE BEASTS AND THE BIRDS ARE SWEPT AWAY BECAUSE THEY SAID HE WILL NOT SEE OUR LATTER END

 IF YOU HAVE RACED WITH MEN ON FOOT AND THEY HAVE WEARIED YOU HOW WILL YOU COMPETE WITH HORSES

AND IF IN A SAFE LAND YOU ARE SO TRUSTING WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE THICKET OF THE JORDAN

FOR EVEN YOUR BROTHERS AND THE HOUSE OF YOUR FATHER EVEN THEY HAVE DEALT TREACHEROUSLY WITH YOU; THEY ARE IN FULL CRY AFTER YOU; DO NOT BELIEVE THEM THOUGH THEY SPEAK FRIENDLY WORDS TO YOU

 I HAVE FORSAKEN MY HOUSE; I HAVE ABANDONED MY HERITAGE; I HAVE GIVEN THE BELOVED OF MY SOUL INTO THE HANDS OF HER ENEMIES

MY HERITAGE HAS BECOME TO ME LIKE A LION IN THE FOREST; SHE HAS LIFTED UP HER VOICE AGAINST ME; THEREFORE I HATE HER

IS MY HERITAGE TO ME LIKE A HYENA'S LAIR

ARE THE BIRDS OF PREY AGAINST HER ALL AROUND

GO ASSEMBLE ALL THE WILD BEASTS; BRING THEM TO DEVOUR

MANY SHEPHERDS HAVE DESTROYED MY VINEYARD; THEY HAVE TRAMPLED DOWN MY PORTION; THEY HAVE MADE MY PLEASANT PORTION A DESOLATE WILDERNESS

THEY HAVE MADE IT A DESOLATION; DESOLATE IT MOURNS TO ME

THE WHOLE LAND IS MADE DESOLATE BUT NO MAN LAYS IT TO HEART

UPON ALL THE BARE HEIGHTS IN THE DESERT DESTROYERS HAVE COME FOR THE SWORD OF THE LORD DEVOURS FROM ONE END OF THE LAND TO THE OTHER; NO FLESH HAS PEACE

THEY HAVE SOWN WHEAT AND HAVE REAPED THORNS; THEY HAVE TIRED THEMSELVES OUT BUT PROFIT NOTHING

THEY SHALL BE ASHAMED OF THEIR HARVESTS BECAUSE OF THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD

 THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING ALL MY EVIL NEIGHBORS WHO TOUCH THE HERITAGE THAT I HAVE GIVEN MY PEOPLE ISRAEL TO INHERIT BEHOLD I WILL PLUCK THEM UP FROM THEIR LAND AND I WILL PLUCK UP THE HOUSE OF JUDAH FROM AMONG THEM

AND AFTER I HAVE PLUCKED THEM UP I WILL AGAIN HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM AND I WILL BRING THEM AGAIN EACH TO HIS HERITAGE AND EACH TO HIS LAND

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF THEY WILL DILIGENTLY LEARN THE WAYS OF MY PEOPLE TO SWEAR BY MY NAME 'AS THE LORD LIVES' EVEN AS THEY TAUGHT MY PEOPLE TO SWEAR BY BAAL THEN THEY SHALL BE BUILT UP IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE

BUT IF ANY NATION WILL NOT LISTEN THEN I WILL UTTERLY PLUCK IT UP AND DESTROY IT DECLARES THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD TO ME GO AND BUY A LINEN LOINCLOTH AND PUT IT AROUND YOUR WAIST AND DO NOT DIP IT IN WATER

 SO I BOUGHT A LOINCLOTH ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD AND PUT IT AROUND MY WAIST

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME A SECOND TIME TAKE THE LOINCLOTH THAT YOU HAVE BOUGHT WHICH IS AROUND YOUR WAIST AND ARISE GO TO THE EUPHRATES AND HIDE IT THERE IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK

 SO I WENT AND HID IT BY THE EUPHRATES AS THE LORD COMMANDED ME

AND AFTER MANY DAYS THE LORD SAID TO ME ARISE GO TO THE EUPHRATES AND TAKE FROM THERE THE LOINCLOTH THAT I COMMANDED YOU TO HIDE THERE

 THEN I WENT TO THE EUPHRATES AND DUG AND I TOOK THE LOINCLOTH FROM THE PLACE WHERE I HAD HIDDEN IT

AND BEHOLD THE LOINCLOTH WAS SPOILED; IT WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME THUS SAYS THE LORD EVEN SO WILL I SPOIL THE PRIDE OF JUDAH AND THE GREAT PRIDE OF JERUSALEM

THIS EVIL PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO HEAR MY WORDS WHO STUBBORNLY FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEART AND HAVE GONE AFTER OTHER GODS TO SERVE THEM AND WORSHIP THEM SHALL BE LIKE THIS LOINCLOTH WHICH IS GOOD FOR NOTHING

FOR AS THE LOINCLOTH CLINGS TO THE WAIST OF A MAN SO I MADE THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF JUDAH CLING TO ME DECLARES THE LORD THAT THEY MIGHT BE FOR ME A PEOPLE A NAME A PRAISE AND A GLORY BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN

YOU SHALL SPEAK TO THEM THIS WORD 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL EVERY JAR SHALL BE FILLED WITH WINE

' AND THEY WILL SAY TO YOU 'DO WE NOT INDEED KNOW THAT EVERY JAR WILL BE FILLED WITH WINE

' THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL FILL WITH DRUNKENNESS ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND THE KINGS WHO SIT ON DAVID'S THRONE THE PRIESTS THE PROPHETS AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

AND I WILL DASH THEM ONE AGAINST ANOTHER FATHERS AND SONS TOGETHER DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL NOT PITY OR SPARE OR HAVE COMPASSION THAT I SHOULD NOT DESTROY THEM

' HEAR AND GIVE EAR; BE NOT PROUD FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD YOUR GOD BEFORE HE BRINGS DARKNESS BEFORE YOUR FEET STUMBLE ON THE TWILIGHT MOUNTAINS AND WHILE YOU LOOK FOR LIGHT HE TURNS IT INTO GLOOM AND MAKES IT DEEP DARKNESS

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN MY SOUL WILL WEEP IN SECRET FOR YOUR PRIDE; MY EYES WILL WEEP BITTERLY AND RUN DOWN WITH TEARS BECAUSE THE LORD'S FLOCK HAS BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE

SAY TO THE KING AND THE QUEEN MOTHER TAKE A LOWLY SEAT FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL CROWN HAS COME DOWN FROM YOUR HEAD

 THE CITIES OF THE NEGEB ARE SHUT UP WITH NONE TO OPEN THEM; ALL JUDAH IS TAKEN INTO EXILE WHOLLY TAKEN INTO EXILE

LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND SEE THOSE WHO COME FROM THE NORTH

WHERE IS THE FLOCK THAT WAS GIVEN YOU YOUR BEAUTIFUL FLOCK

WHAT WILL YOU SAY WHEN THEY SET AS HEAD OVER YOU THOSE WHOM YOU YOURSELF HAVE TAUGHT TO BE FRIENDS TO YOU

WILL NOT PANGS TAKE HOLD OF YOU LIKE THOSE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

AND IF YOU SAY IN YOUR HEART 'WHY HAVE THESE THINGS COME UPON ME

' IT IS FOR THE GREATNESS OF YOUR INIQUITY THAT YOUR SKIRTS ARE LIFTED UP AND YOU SUFFER VIOLENCE

CAN THE ETHIOPIAN CHANGE HIS SKIN OR THE LEOPARD HIS SPOTS

THEN ALSO YOU CAN DO GOOD WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DO EVIL

I WILL SCATTER YOU LIKE CHAFF DRIVEN BY THE WIND FROM THE DESERT

THIS IS YOUR LOT THE PORTION I HAVE MEASURED OUT TO YOU DECLARES THE LORD BECAUSE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ME AND TRUSTED IN LIES

I MYSELF WILL LIFT UP YOUR SKIRTS OVER YOUR FACE AND YOUR SHAME WILL BE SEEN

I HAVE SEEN YOUR ABOMINATIONS YOUR ADULTERIES AND NEIGHINGS YOUR LEWD WHORINGS ON THE HILLS IN THE FIELD

WOE TO YOU O JERUSALEM

HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE YOU ARE MADE CLEAN

THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH CONCERNING THE DROUGHT JUDAH MOURNS AND HER GATES LANGUISH; HER PEOPLE LAMENT ON THE GROUND AND THE CRY OF JERUSALEM GOES UP

HER NOBLES SEND THEIR SERVANTS FOR WATER; THEY COME TO THE CISTERNS; THEY FIND NO WATER; THEY RETURN WITH THEIR VESSELS EMPTY; THEY ARE ASHAMED AND CONFOUNDED AND COVER THEIR HEADS

BECAUSE OF THE GROUND THAT IS DISMAYED SINCE THERE IS NO RAIN ON THE LAND THE FARMERS ARE ASHAMED; THEY COVER THEIR HEADS

EVEN THE DOE IN THE FIELD FORSAKES HER NEWBORN FAWN BECAUSE THERE IS NO GRASS

THE WILD DONKEYS STAND ON THE BARE HEIGHTS; THEY PANT FOR AIR LIKE JACKALS; THEIR EYES FAIL BECAUSE THERE IS NO VEGETATION

THOUGH OUR INIQUITIES TESTIFY AGAINST US ACT O LORD FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE; FOR OUR BACKSLIDINGS ARE MANY; WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

O YOU HOPE OF ISRAEL ITS SAVIOR IN TIME OF TROUBLE WHY SHOULD YOU BE LIKE A STRANGER IN THE LAND LIKE A TRAVELER WHO TURNS ASIDE TO TARRY FOR A NIGHT

WHY SHOULD YOU BE LIKE A MAN CONFUSED LIKE A MIGHTY WARRIOR WHO CANNOT SAVE

YET YOU O LORD ARE IN THE MIDST OF US AND WE ARE CALLED BY YOUR NAME; DO NOT LEAVE US

 THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THIS PEOPLE THEY HAVE LOVED TO WANDER THUS; THEY HAVE NOT RESTRAINED THEIR FEET; THEREFORE THE LORD DOES NOT ACCEPT THEM; NOW HE WILL REMEMBER THEIR INIQUITY AND PUNISH THEIR SINS

 THE LORD SAID TO ME DO NOT PRAY FOR THE WELFARE OF THIS PEOPLE

THOUGH THEY FAST I WILL NOT HEAR THEIR CRY AND THOUGH THEY OFFER BURNT OFFERING AND GRAIN OFFERING I WILL NOT ACCEPT THEM

BUT I WILL CONSUME THEM BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE

 THEN I SAID AH LORD GOD BEHOLD THE PROPHETS SAY TO THEM 'YOU SHALL NOT SEE THE SWORD NOR SHALL YOU HAVE FAMINE BUT I WILL GIVE YOU ASSURED PEACE IN THIS PLACE

' AND THE LORD SAID TO ME THE PROPHETS ARE PROPHESYING LIES IN MY NAME

I DID NOT SEND THEM NOR DID I COMMAND THEM OR SPEAK TO THEM

THEY ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU A LYING VISION WORTHLESS DIVINATION AND THE DECEIT OF THEIR OWN MINDS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE PROPHETS WHO PROPHESY IN MY NAME ALTHOUGH I DID NOT SEND THEM AND WHO SAY 'SWORD AND FAMINE SHALL NOT COME UPON THIS LAND' BY SWORD AND FAMINE THOSE PROPHETS SHALL BE CONSUMED

AND THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THEY PROPHESY SHALL BE CAST OUT IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM VICTIMS OF FAMINE AND SWORD WITH NONE TO BURY THEMTHEM THEIR WIVES THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS

FOR I WILL POUR OUT THEIR EVIL UPON THEM

YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM THIS WORD 'LET MY EYES RUN DOWN WITH TEARS NIGHT AND DAY AND LET THEM NOT CEASE FOR THE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE IS SHATTERED WITH A GREAT WOUND WITH A VERY GRIEVOUS BLOW

IF I GO OUT INTO THE FIELD BEHOLD THOSE PIERCED BY THE SWORD

AND IF I ENTER THE CITY BEHOLD THE DISEASES OF FAMINE

FOR BOTH PROPHET AND PRIEST PLY THEIR TRADE THROUGH THE LAND AND HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE

' HAVE YOU UTTERLY REJECTED JUDAH

DOES YOUR SOUL LOATHE ZION

WHY HAVE YOU STRUCK US DOWN SO THAT THERE IS NO HEALING FOR US

WE LOOKED FOR PEACE BUT NO GOOD CAME; FOR A TIME OF HEALING BUT BEHOLD TERROR

WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR WICKEDNESS O LORD AND THE INIQUITY OF OUR FATHERS FOR WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

DO NOT SPURN US FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE; DO NOT DISHONOR YOUR GLORIOUS THRONE; REMEMBER AND DO NOT BREAK YOUR COVENANT WITH US

ARE THERE ANY AMONG THE FALSE GODS OF THE NATIONS THAT CAN BRING RAIN

OR CAN THE HEAVENS GIVE SHOWERS

ARE YOU NOT HE O LORD OUR GOD

WE SET OUR HOPE ON YOU FOR YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME THOUGH MOSES AND SAMUEL STOOD BEFORE ME YET MY HEART WOULD NOT TURN TOWARD THIS PEOPLE

SEND THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT AND LET THEM GO

AND WHEN THEY ASK YOU 'WHERE SHALL WE GO

' YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD 'THOSE WHO ARE FOR PESTILENCE TO PESTILENCE AND THOSE WHO ARE FOR THE SWORD TO THE SWORD; THOSE WHO ARE FOR FAMINE TO FAMINE AND THOSE WHO ARE FOR CAPTIVITY TO CAPTIVITY

' I WILL APPOINT OVER THEM FOUR KINDS OF DESTROYERS DECLARES THE LORD THE SWORD TO KILL THE DOGS TO TEAR AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH TO DEVOUR AND DESTROY

AND I WILL MAKE THEM A HORROR TO ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH BECAUSE OF WHAT MANASSEH THE SON OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH DID IN JERUSALEM

WHO WILL HAVE PITY ON YOU O JERUSALEM OR WHO WILL GRIEVE FOR YOU

WHO WILL TURN ASIDE TO ASK ABOUT YOUR WELFARE

YOU HAVE REJECTED ME DECLARES THE LORD; YOU KEEP GOING BACKWARD SO I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HAND AGAINST YOU AND DESTROYED YOUI AM WEARY OF RELENTING

I HAVE WINNOWED THEM WITH A WINNOWING FORK IN THE GATES OF THE LAND; I HAVE BEREAVED THEM; I HAVE DESTROYED MY PEOPLE; THEY DID NOT TURN FROM THEIR WAYS

I HAVE MADE THEIR WIDOWS MORE IN NUMBER THAN THE SAND OF THE SEAS; I HAVE BROUGHT AGAINST THE MOTHERS OF YOUNG MEN A DESTROYER AT NOONDAY; I HAVE MADE ANGUISH AND TERROR FALL UPON THEM SUDDENLY

SHE WHO BORE SEVEN HAS GROWN FEEBLE; SHE HAS FAINTED AWAY; HER SUN WENT DOWN WHILE IT WAS YET DAY; SHE HAS BEEN SHAMED AND DISGRACED

AND THE REST OF THEM I WILL GIVE TO THE SWORD BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES DECLARES THE LORD

 WOE IS ME MY MOTHER THAT YOU BORE ME A MAN OF STRIFE AND CONTENTION TO THE WHOLE LAND

I HAVE NOT LENT NOR HAVE I BORROWED YET ALL OF THEM CURSE ME

THE LORD SAID HAVE I NOT SET YOU FREE FOR THEIR GOOD

HAVE I NOT PLEADED FOR YOU BEFORE THE ENEMY IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE AND IN THE TIME OF DISTRESS

CAN ONE BREAK IRON IRON FROM THE NORTH AND BRONZE

YOUR WEALTH AND YOUR TREASURES I WILL GIVE AS SPOIL WITHOUT PRICE FOR ALL YOUR SINS THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR TERRITORY

I WILL MAKE YOU SERVE YOUR ENEMIES IN A LAND THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW FOR IN MY ANGER A FIRE IS KINDLED THAT SHALL BURN FOREVER

 O LORD YOU KNOW; REMEMBER ME AND VISIT ME AND TAKE VENGEANCE FOR ME ON MY PERSECUTORS

IN YOUR FORBEARANCE TAKE ME NOT AWAY; KNOW THAT FOR YOUR SAKE I BEAR REPROACH

YOUR WORDS WERE FOUND AND I ATE THEM AND YOUR WORDS BECAME TO ME A JOY AND THE DELIGHT OF MY HEART FOR I AM CALLED BY YOUR NAME O LORD GOD OF HOSTS

I DID NOT SIT IN THE COMPANY OF REVELERS NOR DID I REJOICE; I SAT ALONE BECAUSE YOUR HAND WAS UPON ME FOR YOU HAD FILLED ME WITH INDIGNATION

WHY IS MY PAIN UNCEASING MY WOUND INCURABLE REFUSING TO BE HEALED

WILL YOU BE TO ME LIKE A DECEITFUL BROOK LIKE WATERS THAT FAIL

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD IF YOU RETURN I WILL RESTORE YOU AND YOU SHALL STAND BEFORE ME

IF YOU UTTER WHAT IS PRECIOUS AND NOT WHAT IS WORTHLESS YOU SHALL BE AS MY MOUTH

THEY SHALL TURN TO YOU BUT YOU SHALL NOT TURN TO THEM

AND I WILL MAKE YOU TO THIS PEOPLE A FORTIFIED WALL OF BRONZE; THEY WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU BUT THEY SHALL NOT PREVAIL OVER YOU FOR I AM WITH YOU TO SAVE YOU AND DELIVER YOU DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL DELIVER YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF THE WICKED AND REDEEM YOU FROM THE GRASP OF THE RUTHLESS

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A WIFE NOR SHALL YOU HAVE SONS OR DAUGHTERS IN THIS PLACE

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO ARE BORN IN THIS PLACE AND CONCERNING THE MOTHERS WHO BORE THEM AND THE FATHERS WHO FATHERED THEM IN THIS LAND THEY SHALL DIE OF DEADLY DISEASES

THEY SHALL NOT BE LAMENTED NOR SHALL THEY BE BURIED

THEY SHALL BE AS DUNG ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND

THEY SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD AND BY FAMINE AND THEIR DEAD BODIES SHALL BE FOOD FOR THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND FOR THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING OR GO TO LAMENT OR GRIEVE FOR THEM FOR I HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY PEACE FROM THIS PEOPLE MY STEADFAST LOVE AND MERCY DECLARES THE LORD

BOTH GREAT AND SMALL SHALL DIE IN THIS LAND

THEY SHALL NOT BE BURIED AND NO ONE SHALL LAMENT FOR THEM OR CUT HIMSELF OR MAKE HIMSELF BALD FOR THEM

NO ONE SHALL BREAK BREAD FOR THE MOURNER TO COMFORT HIM FOR THE DEAD NOR SHALL ANYONE GIVE HIM THE CUP OF CONSOLATION TO DRINK FOR HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER

YOU SHALL NOT GO INTO THE HOUSE OF FEASTING TO SIT WITH THEM TO EAT AND DRINK

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL SILENCE IN THIS PLACE BEFORE YOUR EYES AND IN YOUR DAYS THE VOICE OF MIRTH AND THE VOICE OF GLADNESS THE VOICE OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE VOICE OF THE BRIDE

AND WHEN YOU TELL THIS PEOPLE ALL THESE WORDS AND THEY SAY TO YOU 'WHY HAS THE LORD PRONOUNCED ALL THIS GREAT EVIL AGAINST US

WHAT IS OUR INIQUITY

WHAT IS THE SIN THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST THE LORD OUR GOD

' THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'BECAUSE YOUR FATHERS HAVE FORSAKEN ME DECLARES THE LORD AND HAVE GONE AFTER OTHER GODS AND HAVE SERVED AND WORSHIPED THEM AND HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND HAVE NOT KEPT MY LAW AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE WORSE THAN YOUR FATHERS FOR BEHOLD EVERY ONE OF YOU FOLLOWS HIS STUBBORN EVIL WILL REFUSING TO LISTEN TO ME

THEREFORE I WILL HURL YOU OUT OF THIS LAND INTO A LAND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR FATHERS HAVE KNOWN AND THERE YOU SHALL SERVE OTHER GODS DAY AND NIGHT FOR I WILL SHOW YOU NO FAVOR

' THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN IT SHALL NO LONGER BE SAID 'AS THE LORD LIVES WHO BROUGHT UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT' BUT 'AS THE LORD LIVES WHO BROUGHT UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE NORTH COUNTRY AND OUT OF ALL THE COUNTRIES WHERE HE HAD DRIVEN THEM

' FOR I WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THEIR OWN LAND THAT I GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS

BEHOLD I AM SENDING FOR MANY FISHERS DECLARES THE LORD AND THEY SHALL CATCH THEM

AND AFTERWARD I WILL SEND FOR MANY HUNTERS AND THEY SHALL HUNT THEM FROM EVERY MOUNTAIN AND EVERY HILL AND OUT OF THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCKS

FOR MY EYES ARE ON ALL THEIR WAYS

THEY ARE NOT HIDDEN FROM ME NOR IS THEIR INIQUITY CONCEALED FROM MY EYES

BUT FIRST I WILL DOUBLY REPAY THEIR INIQUITY AND THEIR SIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE POLLUTED MY LAND WITH THE CARCASSES OF THEIR DETESTABLE IDOLS AND HAVE FILLED MY INHERITANCE WITH THEIR ABOMINATIONS

 O LORD MY STRENGTH AND MY STRONGHOLD MY REFUGE IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE TO YOU SHALL THE NATIONS COME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SAY OUR FATHERS HAVE INHERITED NOTHING BUT LIES WORTHLESS THINGS IN WHICH THERE IS NO PROFIT

CAN MAN MAKE FOR HIMSELF GODS

SUCH ARE NOT GODS

 THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL MAKE THEM KNOW THIS ONCE I WILL MAKE THEM KNOW MY POWER AND MY MIGHT AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT MY NAME IS THE LORD

THE SIN OF JUDAH IS WRITTEN WITH A PEN OF IRON; WITH A POINT OF DIAMOND IT IS ENGRAVED ON THE TABLET OF THEIR HEART AND ON THE HORNS OF THEIR ALTARS WHILE THEIR CHILDREN REMEMBER THEIR ALTARS AND THEIR ASHERIM BESIDE EVERY GREEN TREE AND ON THE HIGH HILLS ON THE MOUNTAINS IN THE OPEN COUNTRY

YOUR WEALTH AND ALL YOUR TREASURES I WILL GIVE FOR SPOIL AS THE PRICE OF YOUR HIGH PLACES FOR SIN THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR TERRITORY

YOU SHALL LOOSEN YOUR HAND FROM YOUR HERITAGE THAT I GAVE TO YOU AND I WILL MAKE YOU SERVE YOUR ENEMIES IN A LAND THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW FOR IN MY ANGER A FIRE IS KINDLED THAT SHALL BURN FOREVER

 THUS SAYS THE LORD CURSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN MAN AND MAKES FLESH HIS STRENGTH WHOSE HEART TURNS AWAY FROM THE LORD

HE IS LIKE A SHRUB IN THE DESERT AND SHALL NOT SEE ANY GOOD COME

HE SHALL DWELL IN THE PARCHED PLACES OF THE WILDERNESS IN AN UNINHABITED SALT LAND

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN THE LORD WHOSE TRUST IS THE LORD

HE IS LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY WATER THAT SENDS OUT ITS ROOTS BY THE STREAM AND DOES NOT FEAR WHEN HEAT COMES FOR ITS LEAVES REMAIN GREEN AND IS NOT ANXIOUS IN THE YEAR OF DROUGHT FOR IT DOES NOT CEASE TO BEAR FRUIT

 THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY SICK; WHO CAN UNDERSTAND IT

I THE LORD SEARCH THE HEART AND TEST THE MIND TO GIVE EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS ACCORDING TO THE FRUIT OF HIS DEEDS

 LIKE THE PARTRIDGE THAT GATHERS A BROOD THAT SHE DID NOT HATCH SO IS HE WHO GETS RICHES BUT NOT BY JUSTICE; IN THE MIDST OF HIS DAYS THEY WILL LEAVE HIM AND AT HIS END HE WILL BE A FOOL

A GLORIOUS THRONE SET ON HIGH FROM THE BEGINNING IS THE PLACE OF OUR SANCTUARY

O LORD THE HOPE OF ISRAEL ALL WHO FORSAKE YOU SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME; THOSE WHO TURN AWAY FROM YOU SHALL BE WRITTEN IN THE EARTH FOR THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATER

HEAL ME O LORD AND I SHALL BE HEALED; SAVE ME AND I SHALL BE SAVED FOR YOU ARE MY PRAISE

BEHOLD THEY SAY TO ME WHERE IS THE WORD OF THE LORD

LET IT COME

 I HAVE NOT RUN AWAY FROM BEING YOUR SHEPHERD NOR HAVE I DESIRED THE DAY OF SICKNESS

YOU KNOW WHAT CAME OUT OF MY LIPS; IT WAS BEFORE YOUR FACE

BE NOT A TERROR TO ME; YOU ARE MY REFUGE IN THE DAY OF DISASTER

LET THOSE BE PUT TO SHAME WHO PERSECUTE ME BUT LET ME NOT BE PUT TO SHAME; LET THEM BE DISMAYED BUT LET ME NOT BE DISMAYED; BRING UPON THEM THE DAY OF DISASTER; DESTROY THEM WITH DOUBLE DESTRUCTION

THUS SAID THE LORD TO ME GO AND STAND IN THE PEOPLE'S GATE BY WHICH THE KINGS OF JUDAH ENTER AND BY WHICH THEY GO OUT AND IN ALL THE GATES OF JERUSALEM AND SAY 'HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD YOU KINGS OF JUDAH AND ALL JUDAH AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM WHO ENTER BY THESE GATES

THUS SAYS THE LORD TAKE CARE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR LIVES AND DO NOT BEAR A BURDEN ON THE SABBATH DAY OR BRING IT IN BY THE GATES OF JERUSALEM

AND DO NOT CARRY A BURDEN OUT OF YOUR HOUSES ON THE SABBATH OR DO ANY WORK BUT KEEP THE SABBATH DAY HOLY AS I COMMANDED YOUR FATHERS

YET THEY DID NOT LISTEN OR INCLINE THEIR EAR BUT STIFFENED THEIR NECK THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HEAR AND RECEIVE INSTRUCTION

'BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO ME DECLARES THE LORD AND BRING IN NO BURDEN BY THE GATES OF THIS CITY ON THE SABBATH DAY BUT KEEP THE SABBATH DAY HOLY AND DO NO WORK ON IT THEN THERE SHALL ENTER BY THE GATES OF THIS CITY KINGS AND PRINCES WHO SIT ON THE THRONE OF DAVID RIDING IN CHARIOTS AND ON HORSES THEY AND THEIR OFFICIALS THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

AND THIS CITY SHALL BE INHABITED FOREVER

AND PEOPLE SHALL COME FROM THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND THE PLACES AROUND JERUSALEM FROM THE LAND OF BENJAMIN FROM THE SHEPHELAH FROM THE HILL COUNTRY AND FROM THE NEGEB BRINGING BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES GRAIN OFFERINGS AND FRANKINCENSE AND BRINGING THANK OFFERINGS TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

BUT IF YOU DO NOT LISTEN TO ME TO KEEP THE SABBATH DAY HOLY AND NOT TO BEAR A BURDEN AND ENTER BY THE GATES OF JERUSALEM ON THE SABBATH DAY THEN I WILL KINDLE A FIRE IN ITS GATES AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE PALACES OF JERUSALEM AND SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED

'THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD ARISE AND GO DOWN TO THE POTTER'S HOUSE AND THERE I WILL LET YOU HEAR MY WORDS

 SO I WENT DOWN TO THE POTTER'S HOUSE AND THERE HE WAS WORKING AT HIS WHEEL

AND THE VESSEL HE WAS MAKING OF CLAY WAS SPOILED IN THE POTTER'S HAND AND HE REWORKED IT INTO ANOTHER VESSEL AS IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE POTTER TO DO

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME O HOUSE OF ISRAEL CAN I NOT DO WITH YOU AS THIS POTTER HAS DONE

DECLARES THE LORD

BEHOLD LIKE THE CLAY IN THE POTTER'S HAND SO ARE YOU IN MY HAND O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

IF AT ANY TIME I DECLARE CONCERNING A NATION OR A KINGDOM THAT I WILL PLUCK UP AND BREAK DOWN AND DESTROY IT AND IF THAT NATION CONCERNING WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TURNS FROM ITS EVIL I WILL RELENT OF THE DISASTER THAT I INTENDED TO DO TO IT

AND IF AT ANY TIME I DECLARE CONCERNING A NATION OR A KINGDOM THAT I WILL BUILD AND PLANT IT AND IF IT DOES EVIL IN MY SIGHT NOT LISTENING TO MY VOICE THEN I WILL RELENT OF THE GOOD THAT I HAD INTENDED TO DO TO IT

NOW THEREFORE SAY TO THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM SHAPING DISASTER AGAINST YOU AND DEVISING A PLAN AGAINST YOU

RETURN EVERY ONE FROM HIS EVIL WAY AND AMEND YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS

' BUT THEY SAY 'THAT IS IN VAIN

WE WILL FOLLOW OUR OWN PLANS AND WILL EVERY ONE ACT ACCORDING TO THE STUBBORNNESS OF HIS EVIL HEART

' THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD ASK AMONG THE NATIONS WHO HAS HEARD THE LIKE OF THIS

THE VIRGIN ISRAEL HAS DONE A VERY HORRIBLE THING

DOES THE SNOW OF LEBANON LEAVE THE CRAGS OF SIRION

DO THE MOUNTAIN WATERS RUN DRY THE COLD FLOWING STREAMS

BUT MY PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN ME; THEY MAKE OFFERINGS TO FALSE GODS; THEY MADE THEM STUMBLE IN THEIR WAYS IN THE ANCIENT ROADS AND TO WALK INTO SIDE ROADS NOT THE HIGHWAY MAKING THEIR LAND A HORROR A THING TO BE HISSED AT FOREVER

EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY IT IS HORRIFIED AND SHAKES HIS HEAD

LIKE THE EAST WIND I WILL SCATTER THEM BEFORE THE ENEMY

I WILL SHOW THEM MY BACK NOT MY FACE IN THE DAY OF THEIR CALAMITY

 THEN THEY SAID COME LET US MAKE PLOTS AGAINST JEREMIAH FOR THE LAW SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE PRIEST NOR COUNSEL FROM THE WISE NOR THE WORD FROM THE PROPHET

COME LET US STRIKE HIM WITH THE TONGUE AND LET US NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY OF HIS WORDS

 HEAR ME O LORD AND LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF MY ADVERSARIES

SHOULD GOOD BE REPAID WITH EVIL

YET THEY HAVE DUG A PIT FOR MY LIFE

REMEMBER HOW I STOOD BEFORE YOU TO SPEAK GOOD FOR THEM TO TURN AWAY YOUR WRATH FROM THEM

THEREFORE DELIVER UP THEIR CHILDREN TO FAMINE; GIVE THEM OVER TO THE POWER OF THE SWORD; LET THEIR WIVES BECOME CHILDLESS AND WIDOWED

MAY THEIR MEN MEET DEATH BY PESTILENCE THEIR YOUTHS BE STRUCK DOWN BY THE SWORD IN BATTLE

MAY A CRY BE HEARD FROM THEIR HOUSES WHEN YOU BRING THE PLUNDERER SUDDENLY UPON THEM

FOR THEY HAVE DUG A PIT TO TAKE ME AND LAID SNARES FOR MY FEET

YET YOU O LORD KNOW ALL THEIR PLOTTING TO KILL ME

FORGIVE NOT THEIR INIQUITY NOR BLOT OUT THEIR SIN FROM YOUR SIGHT

LET THEM BE OVERTHROWN BEFORE YOU; DEAL WITH THEM IN THE TIME OF YOUR ANGER

THUS SAYS THE LORD GO BUY A POTTER'S EARTHENWARE FLASK AND TAKE SOME OF THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE AND SOME OF THE ELDERS OF THE PRIESTS AND GO OUT TO THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM AT THE ENTRY OF THE POTSHERD GATE AND PROCLAIM THERE THE WORDS THAT I TELL YOU

YOU SHALL SAY 'HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O KINGS OF JUDAH AND INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I AM BRINGING SUCH DISASTER UPON THIS PLACE THAT THE EARS OF EVERYONE WHO HEARS OF IT WILL TINGLE

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND HAVE PROFANED THIS PLACE BY MAKING OFFERINGS IN IT TO OTHER GODS WHOM NEITHER THEY NOR THEIR FATHERS NOR THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAVE KNOWN; AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE FILLED THIS PLACE WITH THE BLOOD OF INNOCENTS AND HAVE BUILT THE HIGH PLACES OF BAAL TO BURN THEIR SONS IN THE FIRE AS BURNT OFFERINGS TO BAAL WHICH I DID NOT COMMAND OR DECREE NOR DID IT COME INTO MY MIND THEREFORE BEHOLD DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN THIS PLACE SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED TOPHETH OR THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM BUT THE VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER

AND IN THIS PLACE I WILL MAKE VOID THE PLANS OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM AND WILL CAUSE THEIR PEOPLE TO FALL BY THE SWORD BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES AND BY THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIFE

I WILL GIVE THEIR DEAD BODIES FOR FOOD TO THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND TO THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

AND I WILL MAKE THIS CITY A HORROR A THING TO BE HISSED AT

EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY IT WILL BE HORRIFIED AND WILL HISS BECAUSE OF ALL ITS WOUNDS

AND I WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS AND EVERYONE SHALL EAT THE FLESH OF HIS NEIGHBOR IN THE SIEGE AND IN THE DISTRESS WITH WHICH THEIR ENEMIES AND THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIFE AFFLICT THEM

' THEN YOU SHALL BREAK THE FLASK IN THE SIGHT OF THE MEN WHO GO WITH YOU AND SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS SO WILL I BREAK THIS PEOPLE AND THIS CITY AS ONE BREAKS A POTTER'S VESSEL SO THAT IT CAN NEVER BE MENDED

MEN SHALL BURY IN TOPHETH BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO PLACE ELSE TO BURY

THUS WILL I DO TO THIS PLACE DECLARES THE LORD AND TO ITS INHABITANTS MAKING THIS CITY LIKE TOPHETH

THE HOUSES OF JERUSALEM AND THE HOUSES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAHALL THE HOUSES ON WHOSE ROOFS OFFERINGS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND DRINK OFFERINGS HAVE BEEN POURED OUT TO OTHER GODSSHALL BE DEFILED LIKE THE PLACE OF TOPHETH

' THEN JEREMIAH CAME FROM TOPHETH WHERE THE LORD HAD SENT HIM TO PROPHESY AND HE STOOD IN THE COURT OF THE LORD'S HOUSE AND SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I AM BRINGING UPON THIS CITY AND UPON ALL ITS TOWNS ALL THE DISASTER THAT I HAVE PRONOUNCED AGAINST IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE STIFFENED THEIR NECK REFUSING TO HEAR MY WORDS

NOW PASHHUR THE PRIEST THE SON OF IMMER WHO WAS CHIEF OFFICER IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD HEARD JEREMIAH PROPHESYING THESE THINGS

THEN PASHHUR BEAT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET AND PUT HIM IN THE STOCKS THAT WERE IN THE UPPER BENJAMIN GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THE NEXT DAY WHEN PASHHUR RELEASED JEREMIAH FROM THE STOCKS JEREMIAH SAID TO HIM THE LORD DOES NOT CALL YOUR NAME PASHHUR BUT TERROR ON EVERY SIDE

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL MAKE YOU A TERROR TO YOURSELF AND TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS

THEY SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD OF THEIR ENEMIES WHILE YOU LOOK ON

AND I WILL GIVE ALL JUDAH INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON

HE SHALL CARRY THEM CAPTIVE TO BABYLON AND SHALL STRIKE THEM DOWN WITH THE SWORD

MOREOVER I WILL GIVE ALL THE WEALTH OF THE CITY ALL ITS GAINS ALL ITS PRIZED BELONGINGS AND ALL THE TREASURES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES WHO SHALL PLUNDER THEM AND SEIZE THEM AND CARRY THEM TO BABYLON

AND YOU PASHHUR AND ALL WHO DWELL IN YOUR HOUSE SHALL GO INTO CAPTIVITY

TO BABYLON YOU SHALL GO AND THERE YOU SHALL DIE AND THERE YOU SHALL BE BURIED YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO WHOM YOU HAVE PROPHESIED FALSELY

 O LORD YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME AND I WAS DECEIVED; YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AND YOU HAVE PREVAILED

I HAVE BECOME A LAUGHINGSTOCK ALL THE DAY; EVERYONE MOCKS ME

FOR WHENEVER I SPEAK I CRY OUT I SHOUT VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION

 FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD HAS BECOME FOR ME A REPROACH AND DERISION ALL DAY LONG

IF I SAY I WILL NOT MENTION HIM OR SPEAK ANY MORE IN HIS NAME THERE IS IN MY HEART AS IT WERE A BURNING FIRE SHUT UP IN MY BONES AND I AM WEARY WITH HOLDING IT IN AND I CANNOT

FOR I HEAR MANY WHISPERING

TERROR IS ON EVERY SIDE

DENOUNCE HIM

LET US DENOUNCE HIM

 SAY ALL MY CLOSE FRIENDS WATCHING FOR MY FALL

PERHAPS HE WILL BE DECEIVED; THEN WE CAN OVERCOME HIM AND TAKE OUR REVENGE ON HIM

 BUT THE LORD IS WITH ME AS A DREAD WARRIOR; THEREFORE MY PERSECUTORS WILL STUMBLE; THEY WILL NOT OVERCOME ME

THEY WILL BE GREATLY SHAMED FOR THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED

THEIR ETERNAL DISHONOR WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN

O LORD OF HOSTS WHO TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS WHO SEES THE HEART AND THE MIND LET ME SEE YOUR VENGEANCE UPON THEM FOR TO YOU HAVE I COMMITTED MY CAUSE

SING TO THE LORD; PRAISE THE LORD

FOR HE HAS DELIVERED THE LIFE OF THE NEEDY FROM THE HAND OF EVILDOERS

CURSED BE THE DAY ON WHICH I WAS BORN

THE DAY WHEN MY MOTHER BORE ME LET IT NOT BE BLESSED

CURSED BE THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE NEWS TO MY FATHER A SON IS BORN TO YOU MAKING HIM VERY GLAD

LET THAT MAN BE LIKE THE CITIES THAT THE LORD OVERTHREW WITHOUT PITY; LET HIM HEAR A CRY IN THE MORNING AND AN ALARM AT NOON BECAUSE HE DID NOT KILL ME IN THE WOMB; SO MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN MY GRAVE AND HER WOMB FOREVER GREAT

WHY DID I COME OUT FROM THE WOMB TO SEE TOIL AND SORROW AND SPEND MY DAYS IN SHAME

THIS IS THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD WHEN KING ZEDEKIAH SENT TO HIM PASHHUR THE SON OF MALCHIAH AND ZEPHANIAH THE PRIEST THE SON OF MAASEIAH SAYING INQUIRE OF THE LORD FOR US FOR NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON IS MAKING WAR AGAINST US

PERHAPS THE LORD WILL DEAL WITH US ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WONDERFUL DEEDS AND WILL MAKE HIM WITHDRAW FROM US

 THEN JEREMIAH SAID TO THEM THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO ZEDEKIAH 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL TURN BACK THE WEAPONS OF WAR THAT ARE IN YOUR HANDS AND WITH WHICH YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON AND AGAINST THE CHALDEANS WHO ARE BESIEGING YOU OUTSIDE THE WALLS

AND I WILL BRING THEM TOGETHER INTO THE MIDST OF THIS CITY

I MYSELF WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND STRONG ARM IN ANGER AND IN FURY AND IN GREAT WRATH

AND I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE INHABITANTS OF THIS CITY BOTH MAN AND BEAST

THEY SHALL DIE OF A GREAT PESTILENCE

AFTERWARD DECLARES THE LORD I WILL GIVE ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND HIS SERVANTS AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS CITY WHO SURVIVE THE PESTILENCE SWORD AND FAMINE INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIVES

HE SHALL STRIKE THEM DOWN WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

HE SHALL NOT PITY THEM OR SPARE THEM OR HAVE COMPASSION

' AND TO THIS PEOPLE YOU SHALL SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I SET BEFORE YOU THE WAY OF LIFE AND THE WAY OF DEATH

HE WHO STAYS IN THIS CITY SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE BUT HE WHO GOES OUT AND SURRENDERS TO THE CHALDEANS WHO ARE BESIEGING YOU SHALL LIVE AND SHALL HAVE HIS LIFE AS A PRIZE OF WAR

FOR I HAVE SET MY FACE AGAINST THIS CITY FOR HARM AND NOT FOR GOOD DECLARES THE LORD IT SHALL BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND HE SHALL BURN IT WITH FIRE

' AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH SAY 'HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O HOUSE OF DAVID

THUS SAYS THE LORD 'EXECUTE JUSTICE IN THE MORNING AND DELIVER FROM THE HAND OF THE OPPRESSOR HIM WHO HAS BEEN ROBBED LEST MY WRATH GO FORTH LIKE FIRE AND BURN WITH NONE TO QUENCH IT BECAUSE OF YOUR EVIL DEEDS

' BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU O INHABITANT OF THE VALLEY O ROCK OF THE PLAIN DECLARES THE LORD; YOU WHO SAY 'WHO SHALL COME DOWN AGAINST US OR WHO SHALL ENTER OUR HABITATIONS

' I WILL PUNISH YOU ACCORDING TO THE FRUIT OF YOUR DEEDS DECLARES THE LORD; I WILL KINDLE A FIRE IN HER FOREST AND IT SHALL DEVOUR ALL THAT IS AROUND HER

THUS SAYS THE LORD GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH AND SPEAK THERE THIS WORD AND SAY 'HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O KING OF JUDAH WHO SITS ON THE THRONE OF DAVID YOU AND YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE WHO ENTER THESE GATES

THUS SAYS THE LORD DO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DELIVER FROM THE HAND OF THE OPPRESSOR HIM WHO HAS BEEN ROBBED

AND DO NO WRONG OR VIOLENCE TO THE RESIDENT ALIEN THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW NOR SHED INNOCENT BLOOD IN THIS PLACE

FOR IF YOU WILL INDEED OBEY THIS WORD THEN THERE SHALL ENTER THE GATES OF THIS HOUSE KINGS WHO SIT ON THE THRONE OF DAVID RIDING IN CHARIOTS AND ON HORSES THEY AND THEIR SERVANTS AND THEIR PEOPLE

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT OBEY THESE WORDS I SWEAR BY MYSELF DECLARES THE LORD THAT THIS HOUSE SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH 'YOU ARE LIKE GILEAD TO ME LIKE THE SUMMIT OF LEBANON YET SURELY I WILL MAKE YOU A DESERT AN UNINHABITED CITY

I WILL PREPARE DESTROYERS AGAINST YOU EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS AND THEY SHALL CUT DOWN YOUR CHOICEST CEDARS AND CAST THEM INTO THE FIRE

'AND MANY NATIONS WILL PASS BY THIS CITY AND EVERY MAN WILL SAY TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHY HAS THE LORD DEALT THUS WITH THIS GREAT CITY

 AND THEY WILL ANSWER BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE COVENANT OF THE LORD THEIR GOD AND WORSHIPED OTHER GODS AND SERVED THEM

' WEEP NOT FOR HIM WHO IS DEAD NOR GRIEVE FOR HIM BUT WEEP BITTERLY FOR HIM WHO GOES AWAY FOR HE SHALL RETURN NO MORE TO SEE HIS NATIVE LAND

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING SHALLUM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH WHO REIGNED INSTEAD OF JOSIAH HIS FATHER AND WHO WENT AWAY FROM THIS PLACE HE SHALL RETURN HERE NO MORE BUT IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE CARRIED HIM CAPTIVE THERE SHALL HE DIE AND HE SHALL NEVER SEE THIS LAND AGAIN

 WOE TO HIM WHO BUILDS HIS HOUSE BY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS UPPER ROOMS BY INJUSTICE WHO MAKES HIS NEIGHBOR SERVE HIM FOR NOTHING AND DOES NOT GIVE HIM HIS WAGES WHO SAYS 'I WILL BUILD MYSELF A GREAT HOUSE WITH SPACIOUS UPPER ROOMS' WHO CUTS OUT WINDOWS FOR IT PANELING IT WITH CEDAR AND PAINTING IT WITH VERMILION

DO YOU THINK YOU ARE A KING BECAUSE YOU COMPETE IN CEDAR

DID NOT YOUR FATHER EAT AND DRINK AND DO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS

THEN IT WAS WELL WITH HIM

HE JUDGED THE CAUSE OF THE POOR AND NEEDY; THEN IT WAS WELL

IS NOT THIS TO KNOW ME

DECLARES THE LORD

BUT YOU HAVE EYES AND HEART ONLY FOR YOUR DISHONEST GAIN FOR SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD AND FOR PRACTICING OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THEY SHALL NOT LAMENT FOR HIM SAYING 'AH MY BROTHER

' OR 'AH SISTER

' THEY SHALL NOT LAMENT FOR HIM SAYING 'AH LORD

' OR 'AH HIS MAJESTY

' WITH THE BURIAL OF A DONKEY HE SHALL BE BURIED DRAGGED AND DUMPED BEYOND THE GATES OF JERUSALEM

 GO UP TO LEBANON AND CRY OUT AND LIFT UP YOUR VOICE IN BASHAN; CRY OUT FROM ABARIM FOR ALL YOUR LOVERS ARE DESTROYED

I SPOKE TO YOU IN YOUR PROSPERITY BUT YOU SAID 'I WILL NOT LISTEN

' THIS HAS BEEN YOUR WAY FROM YOUR YOUTH THAT YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE

THE WIND SHALL SHEPHERD ALL YOUR SHEPHERDS AND YOUR LOVERS SHALL GO INTO CAPTIVITY; THEN YOU WILL BE ASHAMED AND CONFOUNDED BECAUSE OF ALL YOUR EVIL

O INHABITANT OF LEBANON NESTED AMONG THE CEDARS HOW YOU WILL BE PITIED WHEN PANGS COME UPON YOU PAIN AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

 AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD THOUGH CONIAH THE SON OF JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH WERE THE SIGNET RING ON MY RIGHT HAND YET I WOULD TEAR YOU OFF AND GIVE YOU INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK YOUR LIFE INTO THE HAND OF THOSE OF WHOM YOU ARE AFRAID EVEN INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND INTO THE HAND OF THE CHALDEANS

I WILL HURL YOU AND THE MOTHER WHO BORE YOU INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHERE YOU WERE NOT BORN AND THERE YOU SHALL DIE

BUT TO THE LAND TO WHICH THEY WILL LONG TO RETURN THERE THEY SHALL NOT RETURN

 IS THIS MAN CONIAH A DESPISED BROKEN POT A VESSEL NO ONE CARES FOR

WHY ARE HE AND HIS CHILDREN HURLED AND CAST INTO A LAND THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW

O LAND LAND LAND HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD WRITE THIS MAN DOWN AS CHILDLESS A MAN WHO SHALL NOT SUCCEED IN HIS DAYS FOR NONE OF HIS OFFSPRING SHALL SUCCEED IN SITTING ON THE THRONE OF DAVID AND RULING AGAIN IN JUDAH

WOE TO THE SHEPHERDS WHO DESTROY AND SCATTER THE SHEEP OF MY PASTURE

 DECLARES THE LORD

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL CONCERNING THE SHEPHERDS WHO CARE FOR MY PEOPLE YOU HAVE SCATTERED MY FLOCK AND HAVE DRIVEN THEM AWAY AND YOU HAVE NOT ATTENDED TO THEM

BEHOLD I WILL ATTEND TO YOU FOR YOUR EVIL DEEDS DECLARES THE LORD

THEN I WILL GATHER THE REMNANT OF MY FLOCK OUT OF ALL THE COUNTRIES WHERE I HAVE DRIVEN THEM AND I WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THEIR FOLD AND THEY SHALL BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY

I WILL SET SHEPHERDS OVER THEM WHO WILL CARE FOR THEM AND THEY SHALL FEAR NO MORE NOR BE DISMAYED NEITHER SHALL ANY BE MISSING DECLARES THE LORD

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL RAISE UP FOR DAVID A RIGHTEOUS BRANCH AND HE SHALL REIGN AS KING AND DEAL WISELY AND SHALL EXECUTE JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE LAND

IN HIS DAYS JUDAH WILL BE SAVED AND ISRAEL WILL DWELL SECURELY

AND THIS IS THE NAME BY WHICH HE WILL BE CALLED 'THE LORD IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

' THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN THEY SHALL NO LONGER SAY 'AS THE LORD LIVES WHO BROUGHT UP THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT' BUT 'AS THE LORD LIVES WHO BROUGHT UP AND LED THE OFFSPRING OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE NORTH COUNTRY AND OUT OF ALL THE COUNTRIES WHERE HE HAD DRIVEN THEM

' THEN THEY SHALL DWELL IN THEIR OWN LAND

 CONCERNING THE PROPHETS MY HEART IS BROKEN WITHIN ME; ALL MY BONES SHAKE; I AM LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN LIKE A MAN OVERCOME BY WINE BECAUSE OF THE LORD AND BECAUSE OF HIS HOLY WORDS

FOR THE LAND IS FULL OF ADULTERERS; BECAUSE OF THE CURSE THE LAND MOURNS AND THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS ARE DRIED UP

THEIR COURSE IS EVIL AND THEIR MIGHT IS NOT RIGHT

BOTH PROPHET AND PRIEST ARE UNGODLY; EVEN IN MY HOUSE I HAVE FOUND THEIR EVIL DECLARES THE LORD

THEREFORE THEIR WAY SHALL BE TO THEM LIKE SLIPPERY PATHS IN THE DARKNESS INTO WHICH THEY SHALL BE DRIVEN AND FALL FOR I WILL BRING DISASTER UPON THEM IN THE YEAR OF THEIR PUNISHMENT DECLARES THE LORD

IN THE PROPHETS OF SAMARIA I SAW AN UNSAVORY THING THEY PROPHESIED BY BAAL AND LED MY PEOPLE ISRAEL ASTRAY

BUT IN THE PROPHETS OF JERUSALEM I HAVE SEEN A HORRIBLE THING THEY COMMIT ADULTERY AND WALK IN LIES; THEY STRENGTHEN THE HANDS OF EVILDOERS SO THAT NO ONE TURNS FROM HIS EVIL; ALL OF THEM HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM TO ME AND ITS INHABITANTS LIKE GOMORRAH

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CONCERNING THE PROPHETS BEHOLD I WILL FEED THEM WITH BITTER FOOD AND GIVE THEM POISONED WATER TO DRINK FOR FROM THE PROPHETS OF JERUSALEM UNGODLINESS HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE LAND

 THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS DO NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS WHO PROPHESY TO YOU FILLING YOU WITH VAIN HOPES

THEY SPEAK VISIONS OF THEIR OWN MINDS NOT FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LORD

THEY SAY CONTINUALLY TO THOSE WHO DESPISE THE WORD OF THE LORD 'IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU'; AND TO EVERYONE WHO STUBBORNLY FOLLOWS HIS OWN HEART THEY SAY 'NO DISASTER SHALL COME UPON YOU

' FOR WHO AMONG THEM HAS STOOD IN THE COUNCIL OF THE LORD TO SEE AND TO HEAR HIS WORD OR WHO HAS PAID ATTENTION TO HIS WORD AND LISTENED

BEHOLD THE STORM OF THE LORD

WRATH HAS GONE FORTH A WHIRLING TEMPEST; IT WILL BURST UPON THE HEAD OF THE WICKED

THE ANGER OF THE LORD WILL NOT TURN BACK UNTIL HE HAS EXECUTED AND ACCOMPLISHED THE INTENTS OF HIS HEART

IN THE LATTER DAYS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IT CLEARLY

I DID NOT SEND THE PROPHETS YET THEY RAN; I DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM YET THEY PROPHESIED

BUT IF THEY HAD STOOD IN MY COUNCIL THEN THEY WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED MY WORDS TO MY PEOPLE AND THEY WOULD HAVE TURNED THEM FROM THEIR EVIL WAY AND FROM THE EVIL OF THEIR DEEDS

AM I A GOD AT HAND DECLARES THE LORD AND NOT A GOD AFAR OFF

CAN A MAN HIDE HIMSELF IN SECRET PLACES SO THAT I CANNOT SEE HIM

DECLARES THE LORD

DO I NOT FILL HEAVEN AND EARTH

DECLARES THE LORD

I HAVE HEARD WHAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SAID WHO PROPHESY LIES IN MY NAME SAYING 'I HAVE DREAMED I HAVE DREAMED

' HOW LONG SHALL THERE BE LIES IN THE HEART OF THE PROPHETS WHO PROPHESY LIES AND WHO PROPHESY THE DECEIT OF THEIR OWN HEART WHO THINK TO MAKE MY PEOPLE FORGET MY NAME BY THEIR DREAMS THAT THEY TELL ONE ANOTHER EVEN AS THEIR FATHERS FORGOT MY NAME FOR BAAL

LET THE PROPHET WHO HAS A DREAM TELL THE DREAM BUT LET HIM WHO HAS MY WORD SPEAK MY WORD FAITHFULLY

WHAT HAS STRAW IN COMMON WITH WHEAT

DECLARES THE LORD

IS NOT MY WORD LIKE FIRE DECLARES THE LORD AND LIKE A HAMMER THAT BREAKS THE ROCK IN PIECES

THEREFORE BEHOLD I AM AGAINST THE PROPHETS DECLARES THE LORD WHO STEAL MY WORDS FROM ONE ANOTHER

BEHOLD I AM AGAINST THE PROPHETS DECLARES THE LORD WHO USE THEIR TONGUES AND DECLARE 'DECLARES THE LORD

' BEHOLD I AM AGAINST THOSE WHO PROPHESY LYING DREAMS DECLARES THE LORD AND WHO TELL THEM AND LEAD MY PEOPLE ASTRAY BY THEIR LIES AND THEIR RECKLESSNESS WHEN I DID NOT SEND THEM OR CHARGE THEM

SO THEY DO NOT PROFIT THIS PEOPLE AT ALL DECLARES THE LORD

WHEN ONE OF THIS PEOPLE OR A PROPHET OR A PRIEST ASKS YOU 'WHAT IS THE BURDEN OF THE LORD

' YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'YOU ARE THE BURDEN AND I WILL CAST YOU OFF DECLARES THE LORD

' AND AS FOR THE PROPHET PRIEST OR ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAYS 'THE BURDEN OF THE LORD' I WILL PUNISH THAT MAN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD

THUS SHALL YOU SAY EVERY ONE TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND EVERY ONE TO HIS BROTHER 'WHAT HAS THE LORD ANSWERED

' OR 'WHAT HAS THE LORD SPOKEN

' BUT 'THE BURDEN OF THE LORD' YOU SHALL MENTION NO MORE FOR THE BURDEN IS EVERY MAN'S OWN WORD AND YOU PERVERT THE WORDS OF THE LIVING GOD THE LORD OF HOSTS OUR GOD

THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO THE PROPHET 'WHAT HAS THE LORD ANSWERED YOU

' OR 'WHAT HAS THE LORD SPOKEN

' BUT IF YOU SAY 'THE BURDEN OF THE LORD' THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID THESE WORDS THE BURDEN OF THE LORD WHEN I SENT TO YOU SAYING YOU SHALL NOT SAY 'THE BURDEN OF THE LORD' THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL SURELY LIFT YOU UP AND CAST YOU AWAY FROM MY PRESENCE YOU AND THE CITY THAT I GAVE TO YOU AND YOUR FATHERS

AND I WILL BRING UPON YOU EVERLASTING REPROACH AND PERPETUAL SHAME WHICH SHALL NOT BE FORGOTTEN

'AFTER NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON HAD TAKEN INTO EXILE FROM JERUSALEM JECONIAH THE SON OF JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH TOGETHER WITH THE OFFICIALS OF JUDAH THE CRAFTSMEN AND THE METAL WORKERS AND HAD BROUGHT THEM TO BABYLON THE LORD SHOWED ME THIS VISION BEHOLD TWO BASKETS OF FIGS PLACED BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

ONE BASKET HAD VERY GOOD FIGS LIKE FIRSTRIPE FIGS BUT THE OTHER BASKET HAD VERY BAD FIGS SO BAD THAT THEY COULD NOT BE EATEN

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME WHAT DO YOU SEE JEREMIAH

 I SAID FIGS THE GOOD FIGS VERY GOOD AND THE BAD FIGS VERY BAD SO BAD THAT THEY CANNOT BE EATEN

 THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL LIKE THESE GOOD FIGS SO I WILL REGARD AS GOOD THE EXILES FROM JUDAH WHOM I HAVE SENT AWAY FROM THIS PLACE TO THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS

I WILL SET MY EYES ON THEM FOR GOOD AND I WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THIS LAND

I WILL BUILD THEM UP AND NOT TEAR THEM DOWN; I WILL PLANT THEM AND NOT UPROOT THEM

I WILL GIVE THEM A HEART TO KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD FOR THEY SHALL RETURN TO ME WITH THEIR WHOLE HEART

BUT THUS SAYS THE LORD LIKE THE BAD FIGS THAT ARE SO BAD THEY CANNOT BE EATEN SO WILL I TREAT ZEDEKIAH THE KING OF JUDAH HIS OFFICIALS THE REMNANT OF JERUSALEM WHO REMAIN IN THIS LAND AND THOSE WHO DWELL IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

I WILL MAKE THEM A HORROR TO ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH TO BE A REPROACH A BYWORD A TAUNT AND A CURSE IN ALL THE PLACES WHERE I SHALL DRIVE THEM

AND I WILL SEND SWORD FAMINE AND PESTILENCE UPON THEM UNTIL THEY SHALL BE UTTERLY DESTROYED FROM THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO THEM AND THEIR FATHERS

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH CONCERNING ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON WHICH JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SPOKE TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FOR TWENTYTHREE YEARS FROM THE THIRTEENTH YEAR OF JOSIAH THE SON OF AMON KING OF JUDAH TO THIS DAY THE WORD OF THE LORD HAS COME TO ME AND I HAVE SPOKEN PERSISTENTLY TO YOU BUT YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED

YOU HAVE NEITHER LISTENED NOR INCLINED YOUR EARS TO HEAR ALTHOUGH THE LORD PERSISTENTLY SENT TO YOU ALL HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS SAYING 'TURN NOW EVERY ONE OF YOU FROM HIS EVIL WAY AND EVIL DEEDS AND DWELL UPON THE LAND THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN TO YOU AND YOUR FATHERS FROM OF OLD AND FOREVER

DO NOT GO AFTER OTHER GODS TO SERVE AND WORSHIP THEM OR PROVOKE ME TO ANGER WITH THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

THEN I WILL DO YOU NO HARM

' YET YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED TO ME DECLARES THE LORD THAT YOU MIGHT PROVOKE ME TO ANGER WITH THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS TO YOUR OWN HARM

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED MY WORDS BEHOLD I WILL SEND FOR ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTH DECLARES THE LORD AND FOR NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING OF BABYLON MY SERVANT AND I WILL BRING THEM AGAINST THIS LAND AND ITS INHABITANTS AND AGAINST ALL THESE SURROUNDING NATIONS

I WILL DEVOTE THEM TO DESTRUCTION AND MAKE THEM A HORROR A HISSING AND AN EVERLASTING DESOLATION

MOREOVER I WILL BANISH FROM THEM THE VOICE OF MIRTH AND THE VOICE OF GLADNESS THE VOICE OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE VOICE OF THE BRIDE THE GRINDING OF THE MILLSTONES AND THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP

THIS WHOLE LAND SHALL BECOME A RUIN AND A WASTE AND THESE NATIONS SHALL SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON SEVENTY YEARS

THEN AFTER SEVENTY YEARS ARE COMPLETED I WILL PUNISH THE KING OF BABYLON AND THAT NATION THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS FOR THEIR INIQUITY DECLARES THE LORD MAKING THE LAND AN EVERLASTING WASTE

I WILL BRING UPON THAT LAND ALL THE WORDS THAT I HAVE UTTERED AGAINST IT EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK WHICH JEREMIAH PROPHESIED AGAINST ALL THE NATIONS

FOR MANY NATIONS AND GREAT KINGS SHALL MAKE SLAVES EVEN OF THEM AND I WILL RECOMPENSE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS AND THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS

 THUS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL SAID TO ME TAKE FROM MY HAND THIS CUP OF THE WINE OF WRATH AND MAKE ALL THE NATIONS TO WHOM I SEND YOU DRINK IT

THEY SHALL DRINK AND STAGGER AND BE CRAZED BECAUSE OF THE SWORD THAT I AM SENDING AMONG THEM

 SO I TOOK THE CUP FROM THE LORD'S HAND AND MADE ALL THE NATIONS TO WHOM THE LORD SENT ME DRINK IT JERUSALEM AND THE CITIES OF JUDAH ITS KINGS AND OFFICIALS TO MAKE THEM A DESOLATION AND A WASTE A HISSING AND A CURSE AS AT THIS DAY; PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT HIS SERVANTS HIS OFFICIALS ALL HIS PEOPLE AND ALL THE MIXED TRIBES AMONG THEM; ALL THE KINGS OF THE LAND OF UZ AND ALL THE KINGS OF THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES ASHKELON GAZA EKRON AND THE REMNANT OF ASHDOD; EDOM MOAB AND THE SONS OF AMMON; ALL THE KINGS OF TYRE ALL THE KINGS OF SIDON AND THE KINGS OF THE COASTLAND ACROSS THE SEA; DEDAN TEMA BUZ AND ALL WHO CUT THE CORNERS OF THEIR HAIR; ALL THE KINGS OF ARABIA AND ALL THE KINGS OF THE MIXED TRIBES WHO DWELL IN THE DESERT; ALL THE KINGS OF ZIMRI ALL THE KINGS OF ELAM AND ALL THE KINGS OF MEDIA; ALL THE KINGS OF THE NORTH FAR AND NEAR ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD THAT ARE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

AND AFTER THEM THE KING OF BABYLON SHALL DRINK

THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL DRINK BE DRUNK AND VOMIT FALL AND RISE NO MORE BECAUSE OF THE SWORD THAT I AM SENDING AMONG YOU

' AND IF THEY REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CUP FROM YOUR HAND TO DRINK THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS YOU MUST DRINK

FOR BEHOLD I BEGIN TO WORK DISASTER AT THE CITY THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME AND SHALL YOU GO UNPUNISHED

YOU SHALL NOT GO UNPUNISHED FOR I AM SUMMONING A SWORD AGAINST ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

' YOU THEREFORE SHALL PROPHESY AGAINST THEM ALL THESE WORDS AND SAY TO THEM 'THE LORD WILL ROAR FROM ON HIGH AND FROM HIS HOLY HABITATION UTTER HIS VOICE; HE WILL ROAR MIGHTILY AGAINST HIS FOLD AND SHOUT LIKE THOSE WHO TREAD GRAPES AGAINST ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH

THE CLAMOR WILL RESOUND TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH FOR THE LORD HAS AN INDICTMENT AGAINST THE NATIONS; HE IS ENTERING INTO JUDGMENT WITH ALL FLESH AND THE WICKED HE WILL PUT TO THE SWORD DECLARES THE LORD

' THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD DISASTER IS GOING FORTH FROM NATION TO NATION AND A GREAT TEMPEST IS STIRRING FROM THE FARTHEST PARTS OF THE EARTH

AND THOSE PIERCED BY THE LORD ON THAT DAY SHALL EXTEND FROM ONE END OF THE EARTH TO THE OTHER

THEY SHALL NOT BE LAMENTED OR GATHERED OR BURIED; THEY SHALL BE DUNG ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND

WAIL YOU SHEPHERDS AND CRY OUT AND ROLL IN ASHES YOU LORDS OF THE FLOCK FOR THE DAYS OF YOUR SLAUGHTER AND DISPERSION HAVE COME AND YOU SHALL FALL LIKE A CHOICE VESSEL

NO REFUGE WILL REMAIN FOR THE SHEPHERDS NOR ESCAPE FOR THE LORDS OF THE FLOCK

A VOICETHE CRY OF THE SHEPHERDS AND THE WAIL OF THE LORDS OF THE FLOCK

FOR THE LORD IS LAYING WASTE THEIR PASTURE AND THE PEACEFUL FOLDS ARE DEVASTATED BECAUSE OF THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD

LIKE A LION HE HAS LEFT HIS LAIR FOR THEIR LAND HAS BECOME A WASTE BECAUSE OF THE SWORD OF THE OPPRESSOR AND BECAUSE OF HIS FIERCE ANGER

IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THIS WORD CAME FROM THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD STAND IN THE COURT OF THE LORD'S HOUSE AND SPEAK TO ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THAT COME TO WORSHIP IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE WORDS THAT I COMMAND YOU TO SPEAK TO THEM; DO NOT HOLD BACK A WORD

IT MAY BE THEY WILL LISTEN AND EVERY ONE TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY THAT I MAY RELENT OF THE DISASTER THAT I INTEND TO DO TO THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR EVIL DEEDS

YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME TO WALK IN MY LAW THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU AND TO LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS WHOM I SEND TO YOU URGENTLY THOUGH YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED THEN I WILL MAKE THIS HOUSE LIKE SHILOH AND I WILL MAKE THIS CITY A CURSE FOR ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH

' THE PRIESTS AND THE PROPHETS AND ALL THE PEOPLE HEARD JEREMIAH SPEAKING THESE WORDS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND WHEN JEREMIAH HAD FINISHED SPEAKING ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED HIM TO SPEAK TO ALL THE PEOPLE THEN THE PRIESTS AND THE PROPHETS AND ALL THE PEOPLE LAID HOLD OF HIM SAYING YOU SHALL DIE

WHY HAVE YOU PROPHESIED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD SAYING 'THIS HOUSE SHALL BE LIKE SHILOH AND THIS CITY SHALL BE DESOLATE WITHOUT INHABITANT'

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND JEREMIAH IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

WHEN THE OFFICIALS OF JUDAH HEARD THESE THINGS THEY CAME UP FROM THE KING'S HOUSE TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND TOOK THEIR SEAT IN THE ENTRY OF THE NEW GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THEN THE PRIESTS AND THE PROPHETS SAID TO THE OFFICIALS AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE THIS MAN DESERVES THE SENTENCE OF DEATH BECAUSE HE HAS PROPHESIED AGAINST THIS CITY AS YOU HAVE HEARD WITH YOUR OWN EARS

 THEN JEREMIAH SPOKE TO ALL THE OFFICIALS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING THE LORD SENT ME TO PROPHESY AGAINST THIS HOUSE AND THIS CITY ALL THE WORDS YOU HAVE HEARD

NOW THEREFORE MEND YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS AND OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND THE LORD WILL RELENT OF THE DISASTER THAT HE HAS PRONOUNCED AGAINST YOU

BUT AS FOR ME BEHOLD I AM IN YOUR HANDS

DO WITH ME AS SEEMS GOOD AND RIGHT TO YOU

ONLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT IF YOU PUT ME TO DEATH YOU WILL BRING INNOCENT BLOOD UPON YOURSELVES AND UPON THIS CITY AND ITS INHABITANTS FOR IN TRUTH THE LORD SENT ME TO YOU TO SPEAK ALL THESE WORDS IN YOUR EARS

 THEN THE OFFICIALS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID TO THE PRIESTS AND THE PROPHETS THIS MAN DOES NOT DESERVE THE SENTENCE OF DEATH FOR HE HAS SPOKEN TO US IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OUR GOD

 AND CERTAIN OF THE ELDERS OF THE LAND AROSE AND SPOKE TO ALL THE ASSEMBLED PEOPLE SAYING MICAH OF MORESHETH PROPHESIED IN THE DAYS OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS 'ZION SHALL BE PLOWED AS A FIELD; JERUSALEM SHALL BECOME A HEAP OF RUINS AND THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE A WOODED HEIGHT

' DID HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND ALL JUDAH PUT HIM TO DEATH

DID HE NOT FEAR THE LORD AND ENTREAT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD AND DID NOT THE LORD RELENT OF THE DISASTER THAT HE HAD PRONOUNCED AGAINST THEM

BUT WE ARE ABOUT TO BRING GREAT DISASTER UPON OURSELVES

 THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO PROPHESIED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD URIAH THE SON OF SHEMAIAH FROM KIRIATHJEARIM

HE PROPHESIED AGAINST THIS CITY AND AGAINST THIS LAND IN WORDS LIKE THOSE OF JEREMIAH

AND WHEN KING JEHOIAKIM WITH ALL HIS WARRIORS AND ALL THE OFFICIALS HEARD HIS WORDS THE KING SOUGHT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

BUT WHEN URIAH HEARD OF IT HE WAS AFRAID AND FLED AND ESCAPED TO EGYPT

THEN KING JEHOIAKIM SENT TO EGYPT CERTAIN MEN ELNATHAN THE SON OF ACHBOR AND OTHERS WITH HIM AND THEY TOOK URIAH FROM EGYPT AND BROUGHT HIM TO KING JEHOIAKIM WHO STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH THE SWORD AND DUMPED HIS DEAD BODY INTO THE BURIAL PLACE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE

BUT THE HAND OF AHIKAM THE SON OF SHAPHAN WAS WITH JEREMIAH SO THAT HE WAS NOT GIVEN OVER TO THE PEOPLE TO BE PUT TO DEATH

IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THIS WORD CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD

THUS THE LORD SAID TO ME MAKE YOURSELF STRAPS AND YOKEBARS AND PUT THEM ON YOUR NECK

SEND WORD TO THE KING OF EDOM THE KING OF MOAB THE KING OF THE SONS OF AMMON THE KING OF TYRE AND THE KING OF SIDON BY THE HAND OF THE ENVOYS WHO HAVE COME TO JERUSALEM TO ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH

GIVE THEM THIS CHARGE FOR THEIR MASTERS 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL THIS IS WHAT YOU SHALL SAY TO YOUR MASTERS IT IS I WHO BY MY GREAT POWER AND MY OUTSTRETCHED ARM HAVE MADE THE EARTH WITH THE MEN AND ANIMALS THAT ARE ON THE EARTH AND I GIVE IT TO WHOMEVER IT SEEMS RIGHT TO ME

NOW I HAVE GIVEN ALL THESE LANDS INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING OF BABYLON MY SERVANT AND I HAVE GIVEN HIM ALSO THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD TO SERVE HIM

ALL THE NATIONS SHALL SERVE HIM AND HIS SON AND HIS GRANDSON UNTIL THE TIME OF HIS OWN LAND COMES

THEN MANY NATIONS AND GREAT KINGS SHALL MAKE HIM THEIR SLAVE

'BUT IF ANY NATION OR KINGDOM WILL NOT SERVE THIS NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND PUT ITS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF THE KING OF BABYLON I WILL PUNISH THAT NATION WITH THE SWORD WITH FAMINE AND WITH PESTILENCE DECLARES THE LORD UNTIL I HAVE CONSUMED IT BY HIS HAND

SO DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR PROPHETS YOUR DIVINERS YOUR DREAMERS YOUR FORTUNETELLERS OR YOUR SORCERERS WHO ARE SAYING TO YOU 'YOU SHALL NOT SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON

' FOR IT IS A LIE THAT THEY ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU WITH THE RESULT THAT YOU WILL BE REMOVED FAR FROM YOUR LAND AND I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT AND YOU WILL PERISH

BUT ANY NATION THAT WILL BRING ITS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND SERVE HIM I WILL LEAVE ON ITS OWN LAND TO WORK IT AND DWELL THERE DECLARES THE LORD

' TO ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH I SPOKE IN LIKE MANNER BRING YOUR NECKS UNDER THE YOKE OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND SERVE HIM AND HIS PEOPLE AND LIVE

WHY WILL YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE DIE BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE AS THE LORD HAS SPOKEN CONCERNING ANY NATION THAT WILL NOT SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON

DO NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS WHO ARE SAYING TO YOU 'YOU SHALL NOT SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON' FOR IT IS A LIE THAT THEY ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU

I HAVE NOT SENT THEM DECLARES THE LORD BUT THEY ARE PROPHESYING FALSELY IN MY NAME WITH THE RESULT THAT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT AND YOU WILL PERISH YOU AND THE PROPHETS WHO ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU

 THEN I SPOKE TO THE PRIESTS AND TO ALL THIS PEOPLE SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD DO NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF YOUR PROPHETS WHO ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU SAYING 'BEHOLD THE VESSELS OF THE LORD'S HOUSE WILL NOW SHORTLY BE BROUGHT BACK FROM BABYLON' FOR IT IS A LIE THAT THEY ARE PROPHESYING TO YOU

DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM; SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON AND LIVE

WHY SHOULD THIS CITY BECOME A DESOLATION

IF THEY ARE PROPHETS AND IF THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH THEM THEN LET THEM INTERCEDE WITH THE LORD OF HOSTS THAT THE VESSELS THAT ARE LEFT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IN THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH AND IN JERUSALEM MAY NOT GO TO BABYLON

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS CONCERNING THE PILLARS THE SEA THE STANDS AND THE REST OF THE VESSELS THAT ARE LEFT IN THIS CITY WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON DID NOT TAKE AWAY WHEN HE TOOK INTO EXILE FROM JERUSALEM TO BABYLON JECONIAH THE SON OF JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH AND ALL THE NOBLES OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL CONCERNING THE VESSELS THAT ARE LEFT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IN THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH AND IN JERUSALEM THEY SHALL BE CARRIED TO BABYLON AND REMAIN THERE UNTIL THE DAY WHEN I VISIT THEM DECLARES THE LORD

THEN I WILL BRING THEM BACK AND RESTORE THEM TO THIS PLACE

IN THAT SAME YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH IN THE FIFTH MONTH OF THE FOURTH YEAR HANANIAH THE SON OF AZZUR THE PROPHET FROM GIBEON SPOKE TO ME IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRIESTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL I HAVE BROKEN THE YOKE OF THE KING OF BABYLON

WITHIN TWO YEARS I WILL BRING BACK TO THIS PLACE ALL THE VESSELS OF THE LORD'S HOUSE WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON TOOK AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AND CARRIED TO BABYLON

I WILL ALSO BRING BACK TO THIS PLACE JECONIAH THE SON OF JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH AND ALL THE EXILES FROM JUDAH WHO WENT TO BABYLON DECLARES THE LORD FOR I WILL BREAK THE YOKE OF THE KING OF BABYLON

 THEN THE PROPHET JEREMIAH SPOKE TO HANANIAH THE PROPHET IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRIESTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STANDING IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE PROPHET JEREMIAH SAID AMEN

MAY THE LORD DO SO; MAY THE LORD MAKE THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE PROPHESIED COME TRUE AND BRING BACK TO THIS PLACE FROM BABYLON THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND ALL THE EXILES

YET HEAR NOW THIS WORD THAT I SPEAK IN YOUR HEARING AND IN THE HEARING OF ALL THE PEOPLE

THE PROPHETS WHO PRECEDED YOU AND ME FROM ANCIENT TIMES PROPHESIED WAR FAMINE AND PESTILENCE AGAINST MANY COUNTRIES AND GREAT KINGDOMS

AS FOR THE PROPHET WHO PROPHESIES PEACE WHEN THE WORD OF THAT PROPHET COMES TO PASS THEN IT WILL BE KNOWN THAT THE LORD HAS TRULY SENT THE PROPHET

 THEN THE PROPHET HANANIAH TOOK THE YOKEBARS FROM THE NECK OF JEREMIAH THE PROPHET AND BROKE THEM

AND HANANIAH SPOKE IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD EVEN SO WILL I BREAK THE YOKE OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON FROM THE NECK OF ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS

 BUT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET WENT HIS WAY

SOMETIME AFTER THE PROPHET HANANIAH HAD BROKEN THE YOKEBARS FROM OFF THE NECK OF JEREMIAH THE PROPHET THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH GO TELL HANANIAH 'THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU HAVE BROKEN WOODEN BARS BUT YOU HAVE MADE IN THEIR PLACE BARS OF IRON

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL I HAVE PUT UPON THE NECK OF ALL THESE NATIONS AN IRON YOKE TO SERVE NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND THEY SHALL SERVE HIM FOR I HAVE GIVEN TO HIM EVEN THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD

' AND JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SAID TO THE PROPHET HANANIAH LISTEN HANANIAH THE LORD HAS NOT SENT YOU AND YOU HAVE MADE THIS PEOPLE TRUST IN A LIE

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BEHOLD I WILL REMOVE YOU FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH

THIS YEAR YOU SHALL DIE BECAUSE YOU HAVE UTTERED REBELLION AGAINST THE LORD

' IN THAT SAME YEAR IN THE SEVENTH MONTH THE PROPHET HANANIAH DIED

THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE LETTER THAT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SENT FROM JERUSALEM TO THE SURVIVING ELDERS OF THE EXILES AND TO THE PRIESTS THE PROPHETS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD TAKEN INTO EXILE FROM JERUSALEM TO BABYLON

THIS WAS AFTER KING JECONIAH AND THE QUEEN MOTHER THE EUNUCHS THE OFFICIALS OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM THE CRAFTSMEN AND THE METAL WORKERS HAD DEPARTED FROM JERUSALEM

' TO SHEMAIAH OF NEHELAM YOU SHALL SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOU HAVE SENT LETTERS IN YOUR NAME TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN JERUSALEM AND TO ZEPHANIAH THE SON OF MAASEIAH THE PRIEST AND TO ALL THE PRIESTS SAYING 'THE LORD HAS MADE YOU PRIEST INSTEAD OF JEHOIADA THE PRIEST TO HAVE CHARGE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OVER EVERY MADMAN WHO PROPHESIES TO PUT HIM IN THE STOCKS AND NECK IRONS

FOR HE HAS SENT TO US IN BABYLON SAYING YOUR EXILE WILL BE LONG; BUILD HOUSES AND LIVE IN THEM AND PLANT GARDENS AND EAT THEIR PRODUCE

' ZEPHANIAH THE PRIEST READ THIS LETTER IN THE HEARING OF JEREMIAH THE PROPHET

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH SEND TO ALL THE EXILES SAYING 'THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING SHEMAIAH OF NEHELAM BECAUSE SHEMAIAH HAD PROPHESIED TO YOU WHEN I DID NOT SEND HIM AND HAS MADE YOU TRUST IN A LIE THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL PUNISH SHEMAIAH OF NEHELAM AND HIS DESCENDANTS

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL SOW THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH WITH THE SEED OF MAN AND THE SEED OF BEAST

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT AS I HAVE WATCHED OVER THEM TO PLUCK UP AND BREAK DOWN TO OVERTHROW DESTROY AND BRING HARM SO I WILL WATCH OVER THEM TO BUILD AND TO PLANT DECLARES THE LORD

IN THOSE DAYS THEY SHALL NO LONGER SAY 'THE FATHERS HAVE EATEN SOUR GRAPES AND THE CHILDREN'S TEETH ARE SET ON EDGE

' BUT EVERYONE SHALL DIE FOR HIS OWN SIN

EACH MAN WHO EATS SOUR GRAPES HIS TEETH SHALL BE SET ON EDGE

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL MAKE A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH NOT LIKE THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT MY COVENANT THAT THEY BROKE THOUGH I WAS THEIR HUSBAND DECLARES THE LORD

IT SHALL NOT BE UPROOTED OR OVERTHROWN ANYMORE FOREVER

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD IN THE TENTH YEAR OF ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH WHICH WAS THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR

AT THAT TIME THE ARMY OF THE KING OF BABYLON WAS BESIEGING JERUSALEM AND JEREMIAH THE PROPHET WAS SHUT UP IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD THAT WAS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF JUDAH

FOR ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH HAD IMPRISONED HIM SAYING WHY DO YOU PROPHESY AND SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM GIVING THIS CITY INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND HE SHALL CAPTURE IT; ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH SHALL NOT ESCAPE OUT OF THE HAND OF THE CHALDEANS BUT SHALL SURELY BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND SHALL SPEAK WITH HIM FACE TO FACE AND SEE HIM EYE TO EYE

AND HE SHALL TAKE ZEDEKIAH TO BABYLON AND THERE HE SHALL REMAIN UNTIL I VISIT HIM DECLARES THE LORD

THOUGH YOU FIGHT AGAINST THE CHALDEANS YOU SHALL NOT SUCCEED'

 JEREMIAH SAID THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME BEHOLD HANAMEL THE SON OF SHALLUM YOUR UNCLE WILL COME TO YOU AND SAY 'BUY MY FIELD THAT IS AT ANATHOTH FOR THE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION BY PURCHASE IS YOURS

' THEN HANAMEL MY COUSIN CAME TO ME IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WORD OF THE LORD AND SAID TO ME 'BUY MY FIELD THAT IS AT ANATHOTH IN THE LAND OF BENJAMIN FOR THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION AND REDEMPTION IS YOURS; BUY IT FOR YOURSELF

' THEN I KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE WORD OF THE LORD

AND I BOUGHT THE FIELD AT ANATHOTH FROM HANAMEL MY COUSIN AND WEIGHED OUT THE MONEY TO HIM SEVENTEEN SHEKELS OF SILVER

I SIGNED THE DEED SEALED IT GOT WITNESSES AND WEIGHED THE MONEY ON SCALES

THEN I TOOK THE SEALED DEED OF PURCHASE CONTAINING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THE OPEN COPY

AND I GAVE THE DEED OF PURCHASE TO BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH SON OF MAHSEIAH IN THE PRESENCE OF HANAMEL MY COUSIN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WITNESSES WHO SIGNED THE DEED OF PURCHASE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE JUDEANS WHO WERE SITTING IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD

I CHARGED BARUCH IN THEIR PRESENCE SAYING 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL TAKE THESE DEEDS BOTH THIS SEALED DEED OF PURCHASE AND THIS OPEN DEED AND PUT THEM IN AN EARTHENWARE VESSEL THAT THEY MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL HOUSES AND FIELDS AND VINEYARDS SHALL AGAIN BE BOUGHT IN THIS LAND

' AFTER I HAD GIVEN THE DEED OF PURCHASE TO BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH I PRAYED TO THE LORD SAYING 'AH LORD GOD

IT IS YOU WHO HAS MADE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH BY YOUR GREAT POWER AND BY YOUR OUTSTRETCHED ARM

NOTHING IS TOO HARD FOR YOU

YOU SHOW STEADFAST LOVE TO THOUSANDS BUT YOU REPAY THE GUILT OF FATHERS TO THEIR CHILDREN AFTER THEM O GREAT AND MIGHTY GOD WHOSE NAME IS THE LORD OF HOSTS GREAT IN COUNSEL AND MIGHTY IN DEED WHOSE EYES ARE OPEN TO ALL THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN REWARDING EACH ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS AND ACCORDING TO THE FRUIT OF HIS DEEDS

YOU HAVE SHOWN SIGNS AND WONDERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND TO THIS DAY IN ISRAEL AND AMONG ALL MANKIND AND HAVE MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF AS AT THIS DAY

YOU BROUGHT YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WITH SIGNS AND WONDERS WITH A STRONG HAND AND OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND WITH GREAT TERROR

AND YOU GAVE THEM THIS LAND WHICH YOU SWORE TO THEIR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY

AND THEY ENTERED AND TOOK POSSESSION OF IT

BUT THEY DID NOT OBEY YOUR VOICE OR WALK IN YOUR LAW

THEY DID NOTHING OF ALL YOU COMMANDED THEM TO DO

THEREFORE YOU HAVE MADE ALL THIS DISASTER COME UPON THEM

BEHOLD THE SIEGE MOUNDS HAVE COME UP TO THE CITY TO TAKE IT AND BECAUSE OF SWORD AND FAMINE AND PESTILENCE THE CITY IS GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CHALDEANS WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST IT

WHAT YOU SPOKE HAS COME TO PASS AND BEHOLD YOU SEE IT

YET YOU O LORD GOD HAVE SAID TO ME BUY THE FIELD FOR MONEY AND GET WITNESSESTHOUGH THE CITY IS GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CHALDEANS

' THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH BEHOLD I AM THE LORD THE GOD OF ALL FLESH

IS ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR ME

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM GIVING THIS CITY INTO THE HANDS OF THE CHALDEANS AND INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND HE SHALL CAPTURE IT

THE CHALDEANS WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THIS CITY SHALL COME AND SET THIS CITY ON FIRE AND BURN IT WITH THE HOUSES ON WHOSE ROOFS OFFERINGS HAVE BEEN MADE TO BAAL AND DRINK OFFERINGS HAVE BEEN POURED OUT TO OTHER GODS TO PROVOKE ME TO ANGER

FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT EVIL IN MY SIGHT FROM THEIR YOUTH

THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT PROVOKE ME TO ANGER BY THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS DECLARES THE LORD

THIS CITY HAS AROUSED MY ANGER AND WRATH FROM THE DAY IT WAS BUILT TO THIS DAY SO THAT I WILL REMOVE IT FROM MY SIGHT BECAUSE OF ALL THE EVIL OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH THAT THEY DID TO PROVOKE ME TO ANGERTHEIR KINGS AND THEIR OFFICIALS THEIR PRIESTS AND THEIR PROPHETS THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

THEY HAVE TURNED TO ME THEIR BACK AND NOT THEIR FACE

AND THOUGH I HAVE TAUGHT THEM PERSISTENTLY THEY HAVE NOT LISTENED TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION

THEY SET UP THEIR ABOMINATIONS IN THE HOUSE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME TO DEFILE IT

THEY BUILT THE HIGH PLACES OF BAAL IN THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM TO OFFER UP THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MOLECH THOUGH I DID NOT COMMAND THEM NOR DID IT ENTER INTO MY MIND THAT THEY SHOULD DO THIS ABOMINATION TO CAUSE JUDAH TO SIN

NOW THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL CONCERNING THIS CITY OF WHICH YOU SAY 'IT IS GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON BY SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE' BEHOLD I WILL GATHER THEM FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH I DROVE THEM IN MY ANGER AND MY WRATH AND IN GREAT INDIGNATION

I WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THIS PLACE AND I WILL MAKE THEM DWELL IN SAFETY

AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD

I WILL GIVE THEM ONE HEART AND ONE WAY THAT THEY MAY FEAR ME FOREVER FOR THEIR OWN GOOD AND THE GOOD OF THEIR CHILDREN AFTER THEM

I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AN EVERLASTING COVENANT THAT I WILL NOT TURN AWAY FROM DOING GOOD TO THEM

AND I WILL PUT THE FEAR OF ME IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY MAY NOT TURN FROM ME

I WILL REJOICE IN DOING THEM GOOD AND I WILL PLANT THEM IN THIS LAND IN FAITHFULNESS WITH ALL MY HEART AND ALL MY SOUL

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD JUST AS I HAVE BROUGHT ALL THIS GREAT DISASTER UPON THIS PEOPLE SO I WILL BRING UPON THEM ALL THE GOOD THAT I PROMISE THEM

FIELDS SHALL BE BOUGHT IN THIS LAND OF WHICH YOU ARE SAYING 'IT IS A DESOLATION WITHOUT MAN OR BEAST; IT IS GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE CHALDEANS

' FIELDS SHALL BE BOUGHT FOR MONEY AND DEEDS SHALL BE SIGNED AND SEALED AND WITNESSED IN THE LAND OF BENJAMIN IN THE PLACES ABOUT JERUSALEM AND IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH IN THE CITIES OF THE HILL COUNTRY IN THE CITIES OF THE SHEPHELAH AND IN THE CITIES OF THE NEGEB; FOR I WILL RESTORE THEIR FORTUNES DECLARES THE LORD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH A SECOND TIME WHILE HE WAS STILL SHUT UP IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO MADE THE EARTH THE LORD WHO FORMED IT TO ESTABLISH ITTHE LORD IS HIS NAME CALL TO ME AND I WILL ANSWER YOU AND WILL TELL YOU GREAT AND HIDDEN THINGS THAT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL CONCERNING THE HOUSES OF THIS CITY AND THE HOUSES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH THAT WERE TORN DOWN TO MAKE A DEFENSE AGAINST THE SIEGE MOUNDS AND AGAINST THE SWORD THEY ARE COMING IN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE CHALDEANS AND TO FILL THEM WITH THE DEAD BODIES OF MEN WHOM I SHALL STRIKE DOWN IN MY ANGER AND MY WRATH FOR I HAVE HIDDEN MY FACE FROM THIS CITY BECAUSE OF ALL THEIR EVIL

BEHOLD I WILL BRING TO IT HEALTH AND HEALING AND I WILL HEAL THEM AND REVEAL TO THEM ABUNDANCE OF PROSPERITY AND SECURITY

I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF JUDAH AND THE FORTUNES OF ISRAEL AND REBUILD THEM AS THEY WERE AT FIRST

AND THIS CITY SHALL BE TO ME A NAME OF JOY A PRAISE AND A GLORY BEFORE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH WHO SHALL HEAR OF ALL THE GOOD THAT I DO FOR THEM

THEY SHALL FEAR AND TREMBLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE GOOD AND ALL THE PROSPERITY I PROVIDE FOR IT

THUS SAYS THE LORD IN THIS PLACE OF WHICH YOU SAY 'IT IS A WASTE WITHOUT MAN OR BEAST' IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM THAT ARE DESOLATE WITHOUT MAN OR INHABITANT OR BEAST THERE SHALL BE HEARD AGAIN THE VOICE OF MIRTH AND THE VOICE OF GLADNESS THE VOICE OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE VOICE OF THE BRIDE THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO SING AS THEY BRING THANK OFFERINGS TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD 'GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD OF HOSTS FOR THE LORD IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

'FOR I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF THE LAND AS AT FIRST SAYS THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THIS PLACE THAT IS WASTE WITHOUT MAN OR BEAST AND IN ALL OF ITS CITIES THERE SHALL AGAIN BE HABITATIONS OF SHEPHERDS RESTING THEIR FLOCKS

IN THE CITIES OF THE HILL COUNTRY IN THE CITIES OF THE SHEPHELAH AND IN THE CITIES OF THE NEGEB IN THE LAND OF BENJAMIN THE PLACES ABOUT JERUSALEM AND IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH FLOCKS SHALL AGAIN PASS UNDER THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHO COUNTS THEM SAYS THE LORD

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL FULFILL THE PROMISE I MADE TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

IN THOSE DAYS AND AT THAT TIME I WILL CAUSE A RIGHTEOUS BRANCH TO SPRING UP FOR DAVID AND HE SHALL EXECUTE JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE LAND

IN THOSE DAYS JUDAH WILL BE SAVED AND JERUSALEM WILL DWELL SECURELY

AND THIS IS THE NAME BY WHICH IT WILL BE CALLED 'THE LORD IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

' FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD DAVID SHALL NEVER LACK A MAN TO SIT ON THE THRONE OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS SHALL NEVER LACK A MAN IN MY PRESENCE TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS TO BURN GRAIN OFFERINGS AND TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOREVER

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH THUS SAYS THE LORD IF YOU CAN BREAK MY COVENANT WITH THE DAY AND MY COVENANT WITH THE NIGHT SO THAT DAY AND NIGHT WILL NOT COME AT THEIR APPOINTED TIME THEN ALSO MY COVENANT WITH DAVID MY SERVANT MAY BE BROKEN SO THAT HE SHALL NOT HAVE A SON TO REIGN ON HIS THRONE AND MY COVENANT WITH THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS MY MINISTERS

AS THE HOST OF HEAVEN CANNOT BE NUMBERED AND THE SANDS OF THE SEA CANNOT BE MEASURED SO I WILL MULTIPLY THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID MY SERVANT AND THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS WHO MINISTER TO ME

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH HAVE YOU NOT OBSERVED THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SAYING 'THE LORD HAS REJECTED THE TWO CLANS THAT HE CHOSE'

THUS THEY HAVE DESPISED MY PEOPLE SO THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER A NATION IN THEIR SIGHT

THUS SAYS THE LORD IF I HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED MY COVENANT WITH DAY AND NIGHT AND THE FIXED ORDER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THEN I WILL REJECT THE OFFSPRING OF JACOB AND DAVID MY SERVANT AND WILL NOT CHOOSE ONE OF HIS OFFSPRING TO RULE OVER THE OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB

FOR I WILL RESTORE THEIR FORTUNES AND WILL HAVE MERCY ON THEM

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD WHEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND ALL HIS ARMY AND ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH UNDER HIS DOMINION AND ALL THE PEOPLES WERE FIGHTING AGAINST JERUSALEM AND ALL OF ITS CITIES THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL GO AND SPEAK TO ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM GIVING THIS CITY INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND HE SHALL BURN IT WITH FIRE

YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE FROM HIS HAND BUT SHALL SURELY BE CAPTURED AND DELIVERED INTO HIS HAND

YOU SHALL SEE THE KING OF BABYLON EYE TO EYE AND SPEAK WITH HIM FACE TO FACE

AND YOU SHALL GO TO BABYLON

' YET HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH

THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING YOU 'YOU SHALL NOT DIE BY THE SWORD

YOU SHALL DIE IN PEACE

AND AS SPICES WERE BURNED FOR YOUR FATHERS THE FORMER KINGS WHO WERE BEFORE YOU SO PEOPLE SHALL BURN SPICES FOR YOU AND LAMENT FOR YOU SAYING ALAS LORD

' FOR I HAVE SPOKEN THE WORD DECLARES THE LORD

 THEN JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SPOKE ALL THESE WORDS TO ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH IN JERUSALEM WHEN THE ARMY OF THE KING OF BABYLON WAS FIGHTING AGAINST JERUSALEM AND AGAINST ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THAT WERE LEFT LACHISH AND AZEKAH FOR THESE WERE THE ONLY FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH THAT REMAINED

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD AFTER KING ZEDEKIAH HAD MADE A COVENANT WITH ALL THE PEOPLE IN JERUSALEM TO MAKE A PROCLAMATION OF LIBERTY TO THEM THAT EVERYONE SHOULD SET FREE HIS HEBREW SLAVES MALE AND FEMALE SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD ENSLAVE A JEW HIS BROTHER

AND THEY OBEYED ALL THE OFFICIALS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ENTERED INTO THE COVENANT THAT EVERYONE WOULD SET FREE HIS SLAVE MALE OR FEMALE SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ENSLAVED AGAIN

THEY OBEYED AND SET THEM FREE

BUT AFTERWARD THEY TURNED AROUND AND TOOK BACK THE MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES THEY HAD SET FREE AND BROUGHT THEM INTO SUBJECTION AS SLAVES

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL I MYSELF MADE A COVENANT WITH YOUR FATHERS WHEN I BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE SAYING 'AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS EACH OF YOU MUST SET FREE THE FELLOW HEBREW WHO HAS BEEN SOLD TO YOU AND HAS SERVED YOU SIX YEARS; YOU MUST SET HIM FREE FROM YOUR SERVICE

' BUT YOUR FATHERS DID NOT LISTEN TO ME OR INCLINE THEIR EARS TO ME

YOU RECENTLY REPENTED AND DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN MY EYES BY PROCLAIMING LIBERTY EACH TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND YOU MADE A COVENANT BEFORE ME IN THE HOUSE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME BUT THEN YOU TURNED AROUND AND PROFANED MY NAME WHEN EACH OF YOU TOOK BACK HIS MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES WHOM YOU HAD SET FREE ACCORDING TO THEIR DESIRE AND YOU BROUGHT THEM INTO SUBJECTION TO BE YOUR SLAVES

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED ME BY PROCLAIMING LIBERTY EVERY ONE TO HIS BROTHER AND TO HIS NEIGHBOR; BEHOLD I PROCLAIM TO YOU LIBERTY TO THE SWORD TO PESTILENCE AND TO FAMINE DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL MAKE YOU A HORROR TO ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH

AND THE MEN WHO TRANSGRESSED MY COVENANT AND DID NOT KEEP THE TERMS OF THE COVENANT THAT THEY MADE BEFORE ME I WILL MAKE THEM LIKE THE CALF THAT THEY CUT IN TWO AND PASSED BETWEEN ITS PARTS THE OFFICIALS OF JUDAH THE OFFICIALS OF JERUSALEM THE EUNUCHS THE PRIESTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WHO PASSED BETWEEN THE PARTS OF THE CALF

AND I WILL GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES AND INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIVES

THEIR DEAD BODIES SHALL BE FOOD FOR THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

AND ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND HIS OFFICIALS I WILL GIVE INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES AND INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIVES INTO THE HAND OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF BABYLON WHICH HAS WITHDRAWN FROM YOU

BEHOLD I WILL COMMAND DECLARES THE LORD AND WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THIS CITY

AND THEY WILL FIGHT AGAINST IT AND TAKE IT AND BURN IT WITH FIRE

I WILL MAKE THE CITIES OF JUDAH A DESOLATION WITHOUT INHABITANT

THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD IN THE DAYS OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH GO TO THE HOUSE OF THE RECHABITES AND SPEAK WITH THEM AND BRING THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD INTO ONE OF THE CHAMBERS; THEN OFFER THEM WINE TO DRINK

 SO I TOOK JAAZANIAH THE SON OF JEREMIAH SON OF HABAZZINIAH AND HIS BROTHERS AND ALL HIS SONS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF THE RECHABITES

I BROUGHT THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD INTO THE CHAMBER OF THE SONS OF HANAN THE SON OF IGDALIAH THE MAN OF GOD WHICH WAS NEAR THE CHAMBER OF THE OFFICIALS ABOVE THE CHAMBER OF MAASEIAH THE SON OF SHALLUM KEEPER OF THE THRESHOLD

THEN I SET BEFORE THE RECHABITES PITCHERS FULL OF WINE AND CUPS AND I SAID TO THEM DRINK WINE

 BUT THEY ANSWERED WE WILL DRINK NO WINE FOR JONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB OUR FATHER COMMANDED US 'YOU SHALL NOT DRINK WINE NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SONS FOREVER

YOU SHALL NOT BUILD A HOUSE; YOU SHALL NOT SOW SEED; YOU SHALL NOT PLANT OR HAVE A VINEYARD; BUT YOU SHALL LIVE IN TENTS ALL YOUR DAYS THAT YOU MAY LIVE MANY DAYS IN THE LAND WHERE YOU SOJOURN

' WE HAVE OBEYED THE VOICE OF JONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB OUR FATHER IN ALL THAT HE COMMANDED US TO DRINK NO WINE ALL OUR DAYS OURSELVES OUR WIVES OUR SONS OR OUR DAUGHTERS AND NOT TO BUILD HOUSES TO DWELL IN

WE HAVE NO VINEYARD OR FIELD OR SEED BUT WE HAVE LIVED IN TENTS AND HAVE OBEYED AND DONE ALL THAT JONADAB OUR FATHER COMMANDED US

BUT WHEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME UP AGAINST THE LAND WE SAID 'COME AND LET US GO TO JERUSALEM FOR FEAR OF THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS AND THE ARMY OF THE SYRIANS

' SO WE ARE LIVING IN JERUSALEM

 THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL GO AND SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM WILL YOU NOT RECEIVE INSTRUCTION AND LISTEN TO MY WORDS

DECLARES THE LORD

THE COMMAND THAT JONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB GAVE TO HIS SONS TO DRINK NO WINE HAS BEEN KEPT AND THEY DRINK NONE TO THIS DAY FOR THEY HAVE OBEYED THEIR FATHER'S COMMAND

I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU PERSISTENTLY BUT YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED TO ME

I HAVE SENT TO YOU ALL MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS SENDING THEM PERSISTENTLY SAYING 'TURN NOW EVERY ONE OF YOU FROM HIS EVIL WAY AND AMEND YOUR DEEDS AND DO NOT GO AFTER OTHER GODS TO SERVE THEM AND THEN YOU SHALL DWELL IN THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO YOU AND YOUR FATHERS

' BUT YOU DID NOT INCLINE YOUR EAR OR LISTEN TO ME

THE SONS OF JONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB HAVE KEPT THE COMMAND THAT THEIR FATHER GAVE THEM BUT THIS PEOPLE HAS NOT OBEYED ME

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I AM BRINGING UPON JUDAH AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM ALL THE DISASTER THAT I HAVE PRONOUNCED AGAINST THEM BECAUSE I HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM AND THEY HAVE NOT LISTENED I HAVE CALLED TO THEM AND THEY HAVE NOT ANSWERED

 BUT TO THE HOUSE OF THE RECHABITES JEREMIAH SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BECAUSE YOU HAVE OBEYED THE COMMAND OF JONADAB YOUR FATHER AND KEPT ALL HIS PRECEPTS AND DONE ALL THAT HE COMMANDED YOU THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL JONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB SHALL NEVER LACK A MAN TO STAND BEFORE ME

IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THIS WORD CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD TAKE A SCROLL AND WRITE ON IT ALL THE WORDS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU AGAINST ISRAEL AND JUDAH AND ALL THE NATIONS FROM THE DAY I SPOKE TO YOU FROM THE DAYS OF JOSIAH UNTIL TODAY

IT MAY BE THAT THE HOUSE OF JUDAH WILL HEAR ALL THE DISASTER THAT I INTEND TO DO TO THEM SO THAT EVERY ONE MAY TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY AND THAT I MAY FORGIVE THEIR INIQUITY AND THEIR SIN

 THEN JEREMIAH CALLED BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH AND BARUCH WROTE ON A SCROLL AT THE DICTATION OF JEREMIAH ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM

AND JEREMIAH ORDERED BARUCH SAYING I AM BANNED FROM GOING TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO YOU ARE TO GO AND ON A DAY OF FASTING IN THE HEARING OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE LORD'S HOUSE YOU SHALL READ THE WORDS OF THE LORD FROM THE SCROLL THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN AT MY DICTATION

YOU SHALL READ THEM ALSO IN THE HEARING OF ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH WHO COME OUT OF THEIR CITIES

IT MAY BE THAT THEIR PLEA FOR MERCY WILL COME BEFORE THE LORD AND THAT EVERY ONE WILL TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY FOR GREAT IS THE ANGER AND WRATH THAT THE LORD HAS PRONOUNCED AGAINST THIS PEOPLE

 AND BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH DID ALL THAT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET ORDERED HIM ABOUT READING FROM THE SCROLL THE WORDS OF THE LORD IN THE LORD'S HOUSE

IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH IN THE NINTH MONTH ALL THE PEOPLE IN JERUSALEM AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM THE CITIES OF JUDAH TO JERUSALEM PROCLAIMED A FAST BEFORE THE LORD

THEN IN THE HEARING OF ALL THE PEOPLE BARUCH READ THE WORDS OF JEREMIAH FROM THE SCROLL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IN THE CHAMBER OF GEMARIAH THE SON OF SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY WHICH WAS IN THE UPPER COURT AT THE ENTRY OF THE NEW GATE OF THE LORD'S HOUSE

WHEN MICAIAH THE SON OF GEMARIAH SON OF SHAPHAN HEARD ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD FROM THE SCROLL HE WENT DOWN TO THE KING'S HOUSE INTO THE SECRETARY'S CHAMBER AND ALL THE OFFICIALS WERE SITTING THERE ELISHAMA THE SECRETARY DELAIAH THE SON OF SHEMAIAH ELNATHAN THE SON OF ACHBOR GEMARIAH THE SON OF SHAPHAN ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF HANANIAH AND ALL THE OFFICIALS

AND MICAIAH TOLD THEM ALL THE WORDS THAT HE HAD HEARD WHEN BARUCH READ THE SCROLL IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE

THEN ALL THE OFFICIALS SENT JEHUDI THE SON OF NETHANIAH SON OF SHELEMIAH SON OF CUSHI TO SAY TO BARUCH TAKE IN YOUR HAND THE SCROLL THAT YOU READ IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE AND COME

 SO BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH TOOK THE SCROLL IN HIS HAND AND CAME TO THEM

AND THEY SAID TO HIM SIT DOWN AND READ IT

 SO BARUCH READ IT TO THEM

WHEN THEY HEARD ALL THE WORDS THEY TURNED ONE TO ANOTHER IN FEAR

AND THEY SAID TO BARUCH WE MUST REPORT ALL THESE WORDS TO THE KING

 THEN THEY ASKED BARUCH TELL US PLEASE HOW DID YOU WRITE ALL THESE WORDS

WAS IT AT HIS DICTATION

 BARUCH ANSWERED THEM HE DICTATED ALL THESE WORDS TO ME WHILE I WROTE THEM WITH INK ON THE SCROLL

 THEN THE OFFICIALS SAID TO BARUCH GO AND HIDE YOU AND JEREMIAH AND LET NO ONE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

 SO THEY WENT INTO THE COURT TO THE KING HAVING PUT THE SCROLL IN THE CHAMBER OF ELISHAMA THE SECRETARY AND THEY REPORTED ALL THE WORDS TO THE KING

THEN THE KING SENT JEHUDI TO GET THE SCROLL AND HE TOOK IT FROM THE CHAMBER OF ELISHAMA THE SECRETARY

AND JEHUDI READ IT TO THE KING AND ALL THE OFFICIALS WHO STOOD BESIDE THE KING

IT WAS THE NINTH MONTH AND THE KING WAS SITTING IN THE WINTER HOUSE AND THERE WAS A FIRE BURNING IN THE FIRE POT BEFORE HIM

AS JEHUDI READ THREE OR FOUR COLUMNS THE KING WOULD CUT THEM OFF WITH A KNIFE AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE IN THE FIRE POT UNTIL THE ENTIRE SCROLL WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE THAT WAS IN THE FIRE POT

YET NEITHER THE KING NOR ANY OF HIS SERVANTS WHO HEARD ALL THESE WORDS WAS AFRAID NOR DID THEY TEAR THEIR GARMENTS

EVEN WHEN ELNATHAN AND DELAIAH AND GEMARIAH URGED THE KING NOT TO BURN THE SCROLL HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM

AND THE KING COMMANDED JERAHMEEL THE KING'S SON AND SERAIAH THE SON OF AZRIEL AND SHELEMIAH THE SON OF ABDEEL TO SEIZE BARUCH THE SECRETARY AND JEREMIAH THE PROPHET BUT THE LORD HID THEM

NOW AFTER THE KING HAD BURNED THE SCROLL WITH THE WORDS THAT BARUCH WROTE AT JEREMIAH'S DICTATION THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH TAKE ANOTHER SCROLL AND WRITE ON IT ALL THE FORMER WORDS THAT WERE IN THE FIRST SCROLL WHICH JEHOIAKIM THE KING OF JUDAH HAS BURNED

AND CONCERNING JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH YOU SHALL SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU HAVE BURNED THIS SCROLL SAYING WHY HAVE YOU WRITTEN IN IT THAT THE KING OF BABYLON WILL CERTAINLY COME AND DESTROY THIS LAND AND WILL CUT OFF FROM IT MAN AND BEAST

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH HE SHALL HAVE NONE TO SIT ON THE THRONE OF DAVID AND HIS DEAD BODY SHALL BE CAST OUT TO THE HEAT BY DAY AND THE FROST BY NIGHT

AND I WILL PUNISH HIM AND HIS OFFSPRING AND HIS SERVANTS FOR THEIR INIQUITY

I WILL BRING UPON THEM AND UPON THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND UPON THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH ALL THE DISASTER THAT I HAVE PRONOUNCED AGAINST THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT HEAR

' THEN JEREMIAH TOOK ANOTHER SCROLL AND GAVE IT TO BARUCH THE SCRIBE THE SON OF NERIAH WHO WROTE ON IT AT THE DICTATION OF JEREMIAH ALL THE WORDS OF THE SCROLL THAT JEHOIAKIM KING OF JUDAH HAD BURNED IN THE FIRE

AND MANY SIMILAR WORDS WERE ADDED TO THEM

ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF JOSIAH WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON MADE KING IN THE LAND OF JUDAH REIGNED INSTEAD OF CONIAH THE SON OF JEHOIAKIM

BUT NEITHER HE NOR HIS SERVANTS NOR THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND LISTENED TO THE WORDS OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE THROUGH JEREMIAH THE PROPHET

KING ZEDEKIAH SENT JEHUCAL THE SON OF SHELEMIAH AND ZEPHANIAH THE PRIEST THE SON OF MAASEIAH TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SAYING PLEASE PRAY FOR US TO THE LORD OUR GOD

 NOW JEREMIAH WAS STILL GOING IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE FOR HE HAD NOT YET BEEN PUT IN PRISON

THE ARMY OF PHARAOH HAD COME OUT OF EGYPT

AND WHEN THE CHALDEANS WHO WERE BESIEGING JERUSALEM HEARD NEWS ABOUT THEM THEY WITHDREW FROM JERUSALEM

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THE KING OF JUDAH WHO SENT YOU TO ME TO INQUIRE OF ME 'BEHOLD PHARAOH'S ARMY THAT CAME TO HELP YOU IS ABOUT TO RETURN TO EGYPT TO ITS OWN LAND

AND THE CHALDEANS SHALL COME BACK AND FIGHT AGAINST THIS CITY

THEY SHALL CAPTURE IT AND BURN IT WITH FIRE

THUS SAYS THE LORD DO NOT DECEIVE YOURSELVES SAYING THE CHALDEANS WILL SURELY GO AWAY FROM US FOR THEY WILL NOT GO AWAY

FOR EVEN IF YOU SHOULD DEFEAT THE WHOLE ARMY OF CHALDEANS WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST YOU AND THERE REMAINED OF THEM ONLY WOUNDED MEN EVERY MAN IN HIS TENT THEY WOULD RISE UP AND BURN THIS CITY WITH FIRE

' NOW WHEN THE CHALDEAN ARMY HAD WITHDRAWN FROM JERUSALEM AT THE APPROACH OF PHARAOH'S ARMY JEREMIAH SET OUT FROM JERUSALEM TO GO TO THE LAND OF BENJAMIN TO RECEIVE HIS PORTION THERE AMONG THE PEOPLE

WHEN HE WAS AT THE BENJAMIN GATE A SENTRY THERE NAMED IRIJAH THE SON OF SHELEMIAH SON OF HANANIAH SEIZED JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SAYING YOU ARE DESERTING TO THE CHALDEANS

 AND JEREMIAH SAID IT IS A LIE; I AM NOT DESERTING TO THE CHALDEANS

 BUT IRIJAH WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND SEIZED JEREMIAH AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE OFFICIALS

AND THE OFFICIALS WERE ENRAGED AT JEREMIAH AND THEY BEAT HIM AND IMPRISONED HIM IN THE HOUSE OF JONATHAN THE SECRETARY FOR IT HAD BEEN MADE A PRISON

WHEN JEREMIAH HAD COME TO THE DUNGEON CELLS AND REMAINED THERE MANY DAYS KING ZEDEKIAH SENT FOR HIM AND RECEIVED HIM

THE KING QUESTIONED HIM SECRETLY IN HIS HOUSE AND SAID IS THERE ANY WORD FROM THE LORD

 JEREMIAH SAID THERE IS

 THEN HE SAID YOU SHALL BE DELIVERED INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF BABYLON

 JEREMIAH ALSO SAID TO KING ZEDEKIAH WHAT WRONG HAVE I DONE TO YOU OR YOUR SERVANTS OR THIS PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE PUT ME IN PRISON

WHERE ARE YOUR PROPHETS WHO PROPHESIED TO YOU SAYING 'THE KING OF BABYLON WILL NOT COME AGAINST YOU AND AGAINST THIS LAND'

NOW HEAR PLEASE O MY LORD THE KING LET MY HUMBLE PLEA COME BEFORE YOU AND DO NOT SEND ME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF JONATHAN THE SECRETARY LEST I DIE THERE

 SO KING ZEDEKIAH GAVE ORDERS AND THEY COMMITTED JEREMIAH TO THE COURT OF THE GUARD

AND A LOAF OF BREAD WAS GIVEN HIM DAILY FROM THE BAKERS' STREET UNTIL ALL THE BREAD OF THE CITY WAS GONE

SO JEREMIAH REMAINED IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD

NOW SHEPHATIAH THE SON OF MATTAN GEDALIAH THE SON OF PASHHUR JUCAL THE SON OF SHELEMIAH AND PASHHUR THE SON OF MALCHIAH HEARD THE WORDS THAT JEREMIAH WAS SAYING TO ALL THE PEOPLE THUS SAYS THE LORD HE WHO STAYS IN THIS CITY SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE BUT HE WHO GOES OUT TO THE CHALDEANS SHALL LIVE

HE SHALL HAVE HIS LIFE AS A PRIZE OF WAR AND LIVE

THUS SAYS THE LORD THIS CITY SHALL SURELY BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND BE TAKEN

 THEN THE OFFICIALS SAID TO THE KING LET THIS MAN BE PUT TO DEATH FOR HE IS WEAKENING THE HANDS OF THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE LEFT IN THIS CITY AND THE HANDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE BY SPEAKING SUCH WORDS TO THEM

FOR THIS MAN IS NOT SEEKING THE WELFARE OF THIS PEOPLE BUT THEIR HARM

 KING ZEDEKIAH SAID BEHOLD HE IS IN YOUR HANDS FOR THE KING CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST YOU

 SO THEY TOOK JEREMIAH AND CAST HIM INTO THE CISTERN OF MALCHIAH THE KING'S SON WHICH WAS IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD LETTING JEREMIAH DOWN BY ROPES

AND THERE WAS NO WATER IN THE CISTERN BUT ONLY MUD AND JEREMIAH SANK IN THE MUD

WHEN EBEDMELECH THE ETHIOPIAN A EUNUCH WHO WAS IN THE KING'S HOUSE HEARD THAT THEY HAD PUT JEREMIAH INTO THE CISTERNTHE KING WAS SITTING IN THE BENJAMIN GATE EBEDMELECH WENT FROM THE KING'S HOUSE AND SAID TO THE KING MY LORD THE KING THESE MEN HAVE DONE EVIL IN ALL THAT THEY DID TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET BY CASTING HIM INTO THE CISTERN AND HE WILL DIE THERE OF HUNGER FOR THERE IS NO BREAD LEFT IN THE CITY

 THEN THE KING COMMANDED EBEDMELECH THE ETHIOPIAN TAKE THREE MEN WITH YOU FROM HERE AND LIFT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET OUT OF THE CISTERN BEFORE HE DIES

 SO EBEDMELECH TOOK THE MEN WITH HIM AND WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING TO A WARDROBE IN THE STOREHOUSE AND TOOK FROM THERE OLD RAGS AND WORNOUT CLOTHES WHICH HE LET DOWN TO JEREMIAH IN THE CISTERN BY ROPES

THEN EBEDMELECH THE ETHIOPIAN SAID TO JEREMIAH PUT THE RAGS AND CLOTHES BETWEEN YOUR ARMPITS AND THE ROPES

 JEREMIAH DID SO

THEN THEY DREW JEREMIAH UP WITH ROPES AND LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE CISTERN

AND JEREMIAH REMAINED IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD

KING ZEDEKIAH SENT FOR JEREMIAH THE PROPHET AND RECEIVED HIM AT THE THIRD ENTRANCE OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

THE KING SAID TO JEREMIAH I WILL ASK YOU A QUESTION; HIDE NOTHING FROM ME

 JEREMIAH SAID TO ZEDEKIAH IF I TELL YOU WILL YOU NOT SURELY PUT ME TO DEATH

AND IF I GIVE YOU COUNSEL YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME

 THEN KING ZEDEKIAH SWORE SECRETLY TO JEREMIAH AS THE LORD LIVES WHO MADE OUR SOULS I WILL NOT PUT YOU TO DEATH OR DELIVER YOU INTO THE HAND OF THESE MEN WHO SEEK YOUR LIFE

 THEN JEREMIAH SAID TO ZEDEKIAH THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL IF YOU WILL SURRENDER TO THE OFFICIALS OF THE KING OF BABYLON THEN YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED AND THIS CITY SHALL NOT BE BURNED WITH FIRE AND YOU AND YOUR HOUSE SHALL LIVE

BUT IF YOU DO NOT SURRENDER TO THE OFFICIALS OF THE KING OF BABYLON THEN THIS CITY SHALL BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE CHALDEANS AND THEY SHALL BURN IT WITH FIRE AND YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE FROM THEIR HAND

 KING ZEDEKIAH SAID TO JEREMIAH I AM AFRAID OF THE JUDEANS WHO HAVE DESERTED TO THE CHALDEANS LEST I BE HANDED OVER TO THEM AND THEY DEAL CRUELLY WITH ME

 JEREMIAH SAID YOU SHALL NOT BE GIVEN TO THEM

OBEY NOW THE VOICE OF THE LORD IN WHAT I SAY TO YOU AND IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU AND YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED

BUT IF YOU REFUSE TO SURRENDER THIS IS THE VISION WHICH THE LORD HAS SHOWN TO ME BEHOLD ALL THE WOMEN LEFT IN THE HOUSE OF THE KING OF JUDAH WERE BEING LED OUT TO THE OFFICIALS OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND WERE SAYING 'YOUR TRUSTED FRIENDS HAVE DECEIVED YOU AND PREVAILED AGAINST YOU; NOW THAT YOUR FEET ARE SUNK IN THE MUD THEY TURN AWAY FROM YOU

' ALL YOUR WIVES AND YOUR SONS SHALL BE LED OUT TO THE CHALDEANS AND YOU YOURSELF SHALL NOT ESCAPE FROM THEIR HAND BUT SHALL BE SEIZED BY THE KING OF BABYLON AND THIS CITY SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE

 THEN ZEDEKIAH SAID TO JEREMIAH LET NO ONE KNOW OF THESE WORDS AND YOU SHALL NOT DIE

IF THE OFFICIALS HEAR THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH YOU AND COME TO YOU AND SAY TO YOU 'TELL US WHAT YOU SAID TO THE KING AND WHAT THE KING SAID TO YOU; HIDE NOTHING FROM US AND WE WILL NOT PUT YOU TO DEATH' THEN YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'I MADE A HUMBLE PLEA TO THE KING THAT HE WOULD NOT SEND ME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF JONATHAN TO DIE THERE

' THEN ALL THE OFFICIALS CAME TO JEREMIAH AND ASKED HIM AND HE ANSWERED THEM AS THE KING HAD INSTRUCTED HIM

SO THEY STOPPED SPEAKING WITH HIM FOR THE CONVERSATION HAD NOT BEEN OVERHEARD

AND JEREMIAH REMAINED IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD UNTIL THE DAY THAT JERUSALEM WAS TAKEN

IN THE NINTH YEAR OF ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH IN THE TENTH MONTH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND ALL HIS ARMY CAME AGAINST JERUSALEM AND BESIEGED IT

IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF ZEDEKIAH IN THE FOURTH MONTH ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE MONTH A BREACH WAS MADE IN THE CITY

THEN ALL THE OFFICIALS OF THE KING OF BABYLON CAME AND SAT IN THE MIDDLE GATE NERGALSAREZER SAMGARNEBU SARSEKIM THE RABSARIS NERGALSAREZER THE RABMAG WITH ALL THE REST OF THE OFFICERS OF THE KING OF BABYLON

WHEN ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND ALL THE SOLDIERS SAW THEM THEY FLED GOING OUT OF THE CITY AT NIGHT BY WAY OF THE KING'S GARDEN THROUGH THE GATE BETWEEN THE TWO WALLS; AND THEY WENT TOWARD THE ARABAH

BUT THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS PURSUED THEM AND OVERTOOK ZEDEKIAH IN THE PLAINS OF JERICHO

AND WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN HIM THEY BROUGHT HIM UP TO NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AT RIBLAH IN THE LAND OF HAMATH; AND HE PASSED SENTENCE ON HIM

THE KING OF BABYLON SLAUGHTERED THE SONS OF ZEDEKIAH AT RIBLAH BEFORE HIS EYES AND THE KING OF BABYLON SLAUGHTERED ALL THE NOBLES OF JUDAH

HE PUT OUT THE EYES OF ZEDEKIAH AND BOUND HIM IN CHAINS TO TAKE HIM TO BABYLON

THE CHALDEANS BURNED THE KING'S HOUSE AND THE HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE AND BROKE DOWN THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM

THEN NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CARRIED INTO EXILE TO BABYLON THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT IN THE CITY THOSE WHO HAD DESERTED TO HIM AND THE PEOPLE WHO REMAINED

NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD LEFT IN THE LAND OF JUDAH SOME OF THE POOR PEOPLE WHO OWNED NOTHING AND GAVE THEM VINEYARDS AND FIELDS AT THE SAME TIME

NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON GAVE COMMAND CONCERNING JEREMIAH THROUGH NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD SAYING TAKE HIM LOOK AFTER HIM WELL AND DO HIM NO HARM BUT DEAL WITH HIM AS HE TELLS YOU

 SO NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD NEBUSHAZBAN THE RABSARIS NERGALSAREZER THE RABMAG AND ALL THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE KING OF BABYLON SENT AND TOOK JEREMIAH FROM THE COURT OF THE GUARD

THEY ENTRUSTED HIM TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN THAT HE SHOULD TAKE HIM HOME

SO HE LIVED AMONG THE PEOPLE

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH WHILE HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE COURT OF THE GUARD GO AND SAY TO EBEDMELECH THE ETHIOPIAN 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL FULFILL MY WORDS AGAINST THIS CITY FOR HARM AND NOT FOR GOOD AND THEY SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE YOU ON THAT DAY

BUT I WILL DELIVER YOU ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD AND YOU SHALL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE MEN OF WHOM YOU ARE AFRAID

FOR I WILL SURELY SAVE YOU AND YOU SHALL NOT FALL BY THE SWORD BUT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR LIFE AS A PRIZE OF WAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR TRUST IN ME DECLARES THE LORD

'THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD AFTER NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD HAD LET HIM GO FROM RAMAH WHEN HE TOOK HIM BOUND IN CHAINS ALONG WITH ALL THE CAPTIVES OF JERUSALEM AND JUDAH WHO WERE BEING EXILED TO BABYLON

THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK JEREMIAH AND SAID TO HIM THE LORD YOUR GOD PRONOUNCED THIS DISASTER AGAINST THIS PLACE

THE LORD HAS BROUGHT IT ABOUT AND HAS DONE AS HE SAID

BECAUSE YOU SINNED AGAINST THE LORD AND DID NOT OBEY HIS VOICE THIS THING HAS COME UPON YOU

NOW BEHOLD I RELEASE YOU TODAY FROM THE CHAINS ON YOUR HANDS

IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU TO COME WITH ME TO BABYLON COME AND I WILL LOOK AFTER YOU WELL BUT IF IT SEEMS WRONG TO YOU TO COME WITH ME TO BABYLON DO NOT COME

SEE THE WHOLE LAND IS BEFORE YOU; GO WHEREVER YOU THINK IT GOOD AND RIGHT TO GO

IF YOU REMAIN THEN RETURN TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN WHOM THE KING OF BABYLON APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND DWELL WITH HIM AMONG THE PEOPLE

OR GO WHEREVER YOU THINK IT RIGHT TO GO

 SO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD GAVE HIM AN ALLOWANCE OF FOOD AND A PRESENT AND LET HIM GO

THEN JEREMIAH WENT TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM AT MIZPAH AND LIVED WITH HIM AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT IN THE LAND

WHEN ALL THE CAPTAINS OF THE FORCES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY AND THEIR MEN HEARD THAT THE KING OF BABYLON HAD APPOINTED GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM GOVERNOR IN THE LAND AND HAD COMMITTED TO HIM MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THOSE OF THE POOREST OF THE LAND WHO HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO EXILE TO BABYLON THEY WENT TO GEDALIAH AT MIZPAHISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH SERAIAH THE SON OF TANHUMETH THE SONS OF EPHAI THE NETOPHATHITE JEZANIAH THE SON OF THE MAACATHITE THEY AND THEIR MEN

GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN SWORE TO THEM AND THEIR MEN SAYING DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SERVE THE CHALDEANS

DWELL IN THE LAND AND SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON AND IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU

AS FOR ME I WILL DWELL AT MIZPAH TO REPRESENT YOU BEFORE THE CHALDEANS WHO WILL COME TO US

BUT AS FOR YOU GATHER WINE AND SUMMER FRUITS AND OIL AND STORE THEM IN YOUR VESSELS AND DWELL IN YOUR CITIES THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN

 LIKEWISE WHEN ALL THE JUDEANS WHO WERE IN MOAB AND AMONG THE AMMONITES AND IN EDOM AND IN OTHER LANDS HEARD THAT THE KING OF BABYLON HAD LEFT A REMNANT IN JUDAH AND HAD APPOINTED GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN AS GOVERNOR OVER THEM THEN ALL THE JUDEANS RETURNED FROM ALL THE PLACES TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND CAME TO THE LAND OF JUDAH TO GEDALIAH AT MIZPAH

AND THEY GATHERED WINE AND SUMMER FRUITS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE

NOW JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE FORCES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY CAME TO GEDALIAH AT MIZPAH AND SAID TO HIM DO YOU KNOW THAT BAALIS THE KING OF THE AMMONITES HAS SENT ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH TO TAKE YOUR LIFE

 BUT GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM WOULD NOT BELIEVE THEM

THEN JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH SPOKE SECRETLY TO GEDALIAH AT MIZPAH PLEASE LET ME GO AND STRIKE DOWN ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH AND NO ONE WILL KNOW IT

WHY SHOULD HE TAKE YOUR LIFE SO THAT ALL THE JUDEANS WHO ARE GATHERED ABOUT YOU WOULD BE SCATTERED AND THE REMNANT OF JUDAH WOULD PERISH

 BUT GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SAID TO JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH YOU SHALL NOT DO THIS THING FOR YOU ARE SPEAKING FALSELY OF ISHMAEL

IN THE SEVENTH MONTH ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH SON OF ELISHAMA OF THE ROYAL FAMILY ONE OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE KING CAME WITH TEN MEN TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM AT MIZPAH

AS THEY ATE BREAD TOGETHER THERE AT MIZPAH ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH AND THE TEN MEN WITH HIM ROSE UP AND STRUCK DOWN GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN WITH THE SWORD AND KILLED HIM WHOM THE KING OF BABYLON HAD APPOINTED GOVERNOR IN THE LAND

ISHMAEL ALSO STRUCK DOWN ALL THE JUDEANS WHO WERE WITH GEDALIAH AT MIZPAH AND THE CHALDEAN SOLDIERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE THERE

ON THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER OF GEDALIAH BEFORE ANYONE KNEW OF IT EIGHTY MEN ARRIVED FROM SHECHEM AND SHILOH AND SAMARIA WITH THEIR BEARDS SHAVED AND THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR BODIES GASHED BRINGING GRAIN OFFERINGS AND INCENSE TO PRESENT AT THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

AND ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH CAME OUT FROM MIZPAH TO MEET THEM WEEPING AS HE CAME

AS HE MET THEM HE SAID TO THEM COME IN TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM

 WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE CITY ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH AND THE MEN WITH HIM SLAUGHTERED THEM AND CAST THEM INTO A CISTERN

BUT THERE WERE TEN MEN AMONG THEM WHO SAID TO ISHMAEL DO NOT PUT US TO DEATH FOR WE HAVE STORES OF WHEAT BARLEY OIL AND HONEY HIDDEN IN THE FIELDS

 SO HE REFRAINED AND DID NOT PUT THEM TO DEATH WITH THEIR COMPANIONS

NOW THE CISTERN INTO WHICH ISHMAEL HAD THROWN ALL THE BODIES OF THE MEN WHOM HE HAD STRUCK DOWN ALONG WITH GEDALIAH WAS THE LARGE CISTERN THAT KING ASA HAD MADE FOR DEFENSE AGAINST BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL; ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH FILLED IT WITH THE SLAIN

THEN ISHMAEL TOOK CAPTIVE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN MIZPAH THE KING'S DAUGHTERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT AT MIZPAH WHOM NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD HAD COMMITTED TO GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM

ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH TOOK THEM CAPTIVE AND SET OUT TO CROSS OVER TO THE AMMONITES

BUT WHEN JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE FORCES WITH HIM HEARD OF ALL THE EVIL THAT ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH HAD DONE THEY TOOK ALL THEIR MEN AND WENT TO FIGHT AGAINST ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH

THEY CAME UPON HIM AT THE GREAT POOL THAT IS IN GIBEON

AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH ISHMAEL SAW JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE FORCES WITH HIM THEY REJOICED

SO ALL THE PEOPLE WHOM ISHMAEL HAD CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE FROM MIZPAH TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK AND WENT TO JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH

BUT ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH ESCAPED FROM JOHANAN WITH EIGHT MEN AND WENT TO THE AMMONITES

THEN JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE LEADERS OF THE FORCES WITH HIM TOOK FROM MIZPAH ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD RECOVERED FROM ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH AFTER HE HAD STRUCK DOWN GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAMSOLDIERS WOMEN CHILDREN AND EUNUCHS WHOM JOHANAN BROUGHT BACK FROM GIBEON

AND THEY WENT AND STAYED AT GERUTH CHIMHAM NEAR BETHLEHEM INTENDING TO GO TO EGYPT BECAUSE OF THE CHALDEANS

FOR THEY WERE AFRAID OF THEM BECAUSE ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH HAD STRUCK DOWN GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM WHOM THE KING OF BABYLON HAD MADE GOVERNOR OVER THE LAND

THEN ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE FORCES AND JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND JEZANIAH THE SON OF HOSHAIAH AND ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST CAME NEAR AND SAID TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET LET OUR PLEA FOR MERCY COME BEFORE YOU AND PRAY TO THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR US FOR ALL THIS REMNANTBECAUSE WE ARE LEFT WITH BUT A FEW AS YOUR EYES SEE US THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD MAY SHOW US THE WAY WE SHOULD GO AND THE THING THAT WE SHOULD DO

 JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SAID TO THEM I HAVE HEARD YOU

BEHOLD I WILL PRAY TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUEST AND WHATEVER THE LORD ANSWERS YOU I WILL TELL YOU

I WILL KEEP NOTHING BACK FROM YOU

 THEN THEY SAID TO JEREMIAH MAY THE LORD BE A TRUE AND FAITHFUL WITNESS AGAINST US IF WE DO NOT ACT ACCORDING TO ALL THE WORD WITH WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD SENDS YOU TO US

WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD WE WILL OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD TO WHOM WE ARE SENDING YOU THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH US WHEN WE OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD

 AT THE END OF TEN DAYS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH

THEN HE SUMMONED JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE FORCES WHO WERE WITH HIM AND ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST AND SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO WHOM YOU SENT ME TO PRESENT YOUR PLEA FOR MERCY BEFORE HIM IF YOU WILL REMAIN IN THIS LAND THEN I WILL BUILD YOU UP AND NOT PULL YOU DOWN; I WILL PLANT YOU AND NOT PLUCK YOU UP; FOR I RELENT OF THE DISASTER THAT I DID TO YOU

DO NOT FEAR THE KING OF BABYLON OF WHOM YOU ARE AFRAID

DO NOT FEAR HIM DECLARES THE LORD FOR I AM WITH YOU TO SAVE YOU AND TO DELIVER YOU FROM HIS HAND

I WILL GRANT YOU MERCY THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY ON YOU AND LET YOU REMAIN IN YOUR OWN LAND

BUT IF YOU SAY 'WE WILL NOT REMAIN IN THIS LAND' DISOBEYING THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SAYING 'NO WE WILL GO TO THE LAND OF EGYPT WHERE WE SHALL NOT SEE WAR OR HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET OR BE HUNGRY FOR BREAD AND WE WILL DWELL THERE' THEN HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O REMNANT OF JUDAH

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL IF YOU SET YOUR FACES TO ENTER EGYPT AND GO TO LIVE THERE THEN THE SWORD THAT YOU FEAR SHALL OVERTAKE YOU THERE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE FAMINE OF WHICH YOU ARE AFRAID SHALL FOLLOW CLOSE AFTER YOU TO EGYPT AND THERE YOU SHALL DIE

ALL THE MEN WHO SET THEIR FACES TO GO TO EGYPT TO LIVE THERE SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE

THEY SHALL HAVE NO REMNANT OR SURVIVOR FROM THE DISASTER THAT I WILL BRING UPON THEM

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL AS MY ANGER AND MY WRATH WERE POURED OUT ON THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SO MY WRATH WILL BE POURED OUT ON YOU WHEN YOU GO TO EGYPT

YOU SHALL BECOME AN EXECRATION A HORROR A CURSE AND A TAUNT

YOU SHALL SEE THIS PLACE NO MORE

THE LORD HAS SAID TO YOU O REMNANT OF JUDAH 'DO NOT GO TO EGYPT

' KNOW FOR A CERTAINTY THAT I HAVE WARNED YOU THIS DAY THAT YOU HAVE GONE ASTRAY AT THE COST OF YOUR LIVES

FOR YOU SENT ME TO THE LORD YOUR GOD SAYING 'PRAY FOR US TO THE LORD OUR GOD AND WHATEVER THE LORD OUR GOD SAYS DECLARE TO US AND WE WILL DO IT

' AND I HAVE THIS DAY DECLARED IT TO YOU BUT YOU HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN ANYTHING THAT HE SENT ME TO TELL YOU

NOW THEREFORE KNOW FOR A CERTAINTY THAT YOU SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU DESIRE TO GO TO LIVE

WHEN JEREMIAH FINISHED SPEAKING TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THESE WORDS OF THE LORD THEIR GOD WITH WHICH THE LORD THEIR GOD HAD SENT HIM TO THEM AZARIAH THE SON OF HOSHAIAH AND JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE INSOLENT MEN SAID TO JEREMIAH YOU ARE TELLING A LIE

THE LORD OUR GOD DID NOT SEND YOU TO SAY 'DO NOT GO TO EGYPT TO LIVE THERE' BUT BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH HAS SET YOU AGAINST US TO DELIVER US INTO THE HAND OF THE CHALDEANS THAT THEY MAY KILL US OR TAKE US INTO EXILE IN BABYLON

 SO JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE FORCES AND ALL THE PEOPLE DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD TO REMAIN IN THE LAND OF JUDAH

BUT JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND ALL THE COMMANDERS OF THE FORCES TOOK ALL THE REMNANT OF JUDAH WHO HAD RETURNED TO LIVE IN THE LAND OF JUDAH FROM ALL THE NATIONS TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN THE MEN THE WOMEN THE CHILDREN THE PRINCESSES AND EVERY PERSON WHOM NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD HAD LEFT WITH GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN; ALSO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET AND BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH

AND THEY CAME INTO THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THEY DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD

AND THEY ARRIVED AT TAHPANHES

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH IN TAHPANHES TAKE IN YOUR HANDS LARGE STONES AND HIDE THEM IN THE MORTAR IN THE PAVEMENT THAT IS AT THE ENTRANCE TO PHARAOH'S PALACE IN TAHPANHES IN THE SIGHT OF THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL SEND AND TAKE NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING OF BABYLON MY SERVANT AND I WILL SET HIS THRONE ABOVE THESE STONES THAT I HAVE HIDDEN AND HE WILL SPREAD HIS ROYAL CANOPY OVER THEM

HE SHALL COME AND STRIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT GIVING OVER TO THE PESTILENCE THOSE WHO ARE DOOMED TO THE PESTILENCE TO CAPTIVITY THOSE WHO ARE DOOMED TO CAPTIVITY AND TO THE SWORD THOSE WHO ARE DOOMED TO THE SWORD

I SHALL KINDLE A FIRE IN THE TEMPLES OF THE GODS OF EGYPT AND HE SHALL BURN THEM AND CARRY THEM AWAY CAPTIVE

AND HE SHALL CLEAN THE LAND OF EGYPT AS A SHEPHERD CLEANS HIS CLOAK OF VERMIN AND HE SHALL GO AWAY FROM THERE IN PEACE

HE SHALL BREAK THE OBELISKS OF HELIOPOLIS WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE TEMPLES OF THE GODS OF EGYPT HE SHALL BURN WITH FIRE

'THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH CONCERNING ALL THE JUDEANS WHO LIVED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AT MIGDOL AT TAHPANHES AT MEMPHIS AND IN THE LAND OF PATHROS THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THE DISASTER THAT I BROUGHT UPON JERUSALEM AND UPON ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH

BEHOLD THIS DAY THEY ARE A DESOLATION AND NO ONE DWELLS IN THEM BECAUSE OF THE EVIL THAT THEY COMMITTED PROVOKING ME TO ANGER IN THAT THEY WENT TO MAKE OFFERINGS AND SERVE OTHER GODS THAT THEY KNEW NOT NEITHER THEY NOR YOU NOR YOUR FATHERS

YET I PERSISTENTLY SENT TO YOU ALL MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS SAYING 'OH DO NOT DO THIS ABOMINATION THAT I HATE

' BUT THEY DID NOT LISTEN OR INCLINE THEIR EAR TO TURN FROM THEIR EVIL AND MAKE NO OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS

THEREFORE MY WRATH AND MY ANGER WERE POURED OUT AND KINDLED IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM AND THEY BECAME A WASTE AND A DESOLATION AS AT THIS DAY

AND NOW THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHY DO YOU COMMIT THIS GREAT EVIL AGAINST YOURSELVES TO CUT OFF FROM YOU MAN AND WOMAN INFANT AND CHILD FROM THE MIDST OF JUDAH LEAVING YOU NO REMNANT

WHY DO YOU PROVOKE ME TO ANGER WITH THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS MAKING OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT WHERE YOU HAVE COME TO LIVE SO THAT YOU MAY BE CUT OFF AND BECOME A CURSE AND A TAUNT AMONG ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH

HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE EVIL OF YOUR FATHERS THE EVIL OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH THE EVIL OF THEIR WIVES YOUR OWN EVIL AND THE EVIL OF YOUR WIVES WHICH THEY COMMITTED IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM

THEY HAVE NOT HUMBLED THEMSELVES EVEN TO THIS DAY NOR HAVE THEY FEARED NOR WALKED IN MY LAW AND MY STATUTES THAT I SET BEFORE YOU AND BEFORE YOUR FATHERS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST YOU FOR HARM TO CUT OFF ALL JUDAH

I WILL TAKE THE REMNANT OF JUDAH WHO HAVE SET THEIR FACES TO COME TO THE LAND OF EGYPT TO LIVE AND THEY SHALL ALL BE CONSUMED

IN THE LAND OF EGYPT THEY SHALL FALL; BY THE SWORD AND BY FAMINE THEY SHALL BE CONSUMED

FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST THEY SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD AND BY FAMINE AND THEY SHALL BECOME AN OATH A HORROR A CURSE AND A TAUNT

I WILL PUNISH THOSE WHO DWELL IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AS I HAVE PUNISHED JERUSALEM WITH THE SWORD WITH FAMINE AND WITH PESTILENCE SO THAT NONE OF THE REMNANT OF JUDAH WHO HAVE COME TO LIVE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL ESCAPE OR SURVIVE OR RETURN TO THE LAND OF JUDAH TO WHICH THEY DESIRE TO RETURN TO DWELL THERE

FOR THEY SHALL NOT RETURN EXCEPT SOME FUGITIVES

 THEN ALL THE MEN WHO KNEW THAT THEIR WIVES HAD MADE OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS AND ALL THE WOMEN WHO STOOD BY A GREAT ASSEMBLY ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN PATHROS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT ANSWERED JEREMIAH AS FOR THE WORD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO US IN THE NAME OF THE LORD WE WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU

BUT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE VOWED MAKE OFFERINGS TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN AND POUR OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO HER AS WE DID BOTH WE AND OUR FATHERS OUR KINGS AND OUR OFFICIALS IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM

FOR THEN WE HAD PLENTY OF FOOD AND PROSPERED AND SAW NO DISASTER

BUT SINCE WE LEFT OFF MAKING OFFERINGS TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN AND POURING OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO HER WE HAVE LACKED EVERYTHING AND HAVE BEEN CONSUMED BY THE SWORD AND BY FAMINE

 AND THE WOMEN SAID WHEN WE MADE OFFERINGS TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN AND POURED OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO HER WAS IT WITHOUT OUR HUSBANDS' APPROVAL THAT WE MADE CAKES FOR HER BEARING HER IMAGE AND POURED OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO HER

 THEN JEREMIAH SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THIS ANSWER AS FOR THE OFFERINGS THAT YOU OFFERED IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM YOU AND YOUR FATHERS YOUR KINGS AND YOUR OFFICIALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND DID NOT THE LORD REMEMBER THEM

DID IT NOT COME INTO HIS MIND

THE LORD COULD NO LONGER BEAR YOUR EVIL DEEDS AND THE ABOMINATIONS THAT YOU COMMITTED

THEREFORE YOUR LAND HAS BECOME A DESOLATION AND A WASTE AND A CURSE WITHOUT INHABITANT AS IT IS THIS DAY

IT IS BECAUSE YOU MADE OFFERINGS AND BECAUSE YOU SINNED AGAINST THE LORD AND DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD OR WALK IN HIS LAW AND IN HIS STATUTES AND IN HIS TESTIMONIES THAT THIS DISASTER HAS HAPPENED TO YOU AS AT THIS DAY

 JEREMIAH SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE WOMEN HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD ALL YOU OF JUDAH WHO ARE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOU AND YOUR WIVES HAVE DECLARED WITH YOUR MOUTHS AND HAVE FULFILLED IT WITH YOUR HANDS SAYING 'WE WILL SURELY PERFORM OUR VOWS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO MAKE OFFERINGS TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN AND TO POUR OUT DRINK OFFERINGS TO HER

' THEN CONFIRM YOUR VOWS AND PERFORM YOUR VOWS

THEREFORE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD ALL YOU OF JUDAH WHO DWELL IN THE LAND OF EGYPT BEHOLD I HAVE SWORN BY MY GREAT NAME SAYS THE LORD THAT MY NAME SHALL NO MORE BE INVOKED BY THE MOUTH OF ANY MAN OF JUDAH IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT SAYING 'AS THE LORD GOD LIVES

' BEHOLD I AM WATCHING OVER THEM FOR DISASTER AND NOT FOR GOOD

ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH WHO ARE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL BE CONSUMED BY THE SWORD AND BY FAMINE UNTIL THERE IS AN END OF THEM

AND THOSE WHO ESCAPE THE SWORD SHALL RETURN FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT TO THE LAND OF JUDAH FEW IN NUMBER; AND ALL THE REMNANT OF JUDAH WHO CAME TO THE LAND OF EGYPT TO LIVE SHALL KNOW WHOSE WORD WILL STAND MINE OR THEIRS

THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO YOU DECLARES THE LORD THAT I WILL PUNISH YOU IN THIS PLACE IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT MY WORDS WILL SURELY STAND AGAINST YOU FOR HARM THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL GIVE PHARAOH HOPHRA KING OF EGYPT INTO THE HAND OF HIS ENEMIES AND INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK HIS LIFE AS I GAVE ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON WHO WAS HIS ENEMY AND SOUGHT HIS LIFE

THE WORD THAT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SPOKE TO BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH WHEN HE WROTE THESE WORDS IN A BOOK AT THE DICTATION OF JEREMIAH IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING OF JUDAH THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO YOU O BARUCH YOU SAID 'WOE IS ME

FOR THE LORD HAS ADDED SORROW TO MY PAIN

I AM WEARY WITH MY GROANING AND I FIND NO REST

' THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD WHAT I HAVE BUILT I AM BREAKING DOWN AND WHAT I HAVE PLANTED I AM PLUCKING UPTHAT IS THE WHOLE LAND

AND DO YOU SEEK GREAT THINGS FOR YOURSELF

SEEK THEM NOT FOR BEHOLD I AM BRINGING DISASTER UPON ALL FLESH DECLARES THE LORD

BUT I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR LIFE AS A PRIZE OF WAR IN ALL PLACES TO WHICH YOU MAY GO

THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET CONCERNING THE NATIONS

DECLARES THE LORD

THE SWIFT CANNOT FLEE AWAY NOR THE WARRIOR ESCAPE; IN THE NORTH BY THE RIVER EUPHRATES THEY HAVE STUMBLED AND FALLEN

WHO IS THIS RISING LIKE THE NILE LIKE RIVERS WHOSE WATERS SURGE

EGYPT RISES LIKE THE NILE LIKE RIVERS WHOSE WATERS SURGE

HE SAID 'I WILL RISE I WILL COVER THE EARTH I WILL DESTROY CITIES AND THEIR INHABITANTS

' ADVANCE O HORSES AND RAGE O CHARIOTS

LET THE WARRIORS GO OUT MEN OF CUSH AND PUT WHO HANDLE THE SHIELD MEN OF LUD SKILLED IN HANDLING THE BOW

THAT DAY IS THE DAY OF THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS A DAY OF VENGEANCE TO AVENGE HIMSELF ON HIS FOES

THE SWORD SHALL DEVOUR AND BE SATED AND DRINK ITS FILL OF THEIR BLOOD

FOR THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS HOLDS A SACRIFICE IN THE NORTH COUNTRY BY THE RIVER EUPHRATES

GO UP TO GILEAD AND TAKE BALM O VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF EGYPT

IN VAIN YOU HAVE USED MANY MEDICINES; THERE IS NO HEALING FOR YOU

THE NATIONS HAVE HEARD OF YOUR SHAME AND THE EARTH IS FULL OF YOUR CRY; FOR WARRIOR HAS STUMBLED AGAINST WARRIOR; THEY HAVE BOTH FALLEN TOGETHER

 THE WORD THAT THE LORD SPOKE TO JEREMIAH THE PROPHET ABOUT THE COMING OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON TO STRIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT DECLARE IN EGYPT AND PROCLAIM IN MIGDOL; PROCLAIM IN MEMPHIS AND TAHPANHES; SAY 'STAND READY AND BE PREPARED FOR THE SWORD SHALL DEVOUR AROUND YOU

' WHY ARE YOUR MIGHTY ONES FACE DOWN

PREPARE YOURSELVES BAGGAGE FOR EXILE O INHABITANTS OF EGYPT

FOR MEMPHIS SHALL BECOME A WASTE A RUIN WITHOUT INHABITANT

A BEAUTIFUL HEIFER IS EGYPT BUT A BITING FLY FROM THE NORTH HAS COME UPON HER

EVEN HER HIRED SOLDIERS IN HER MIDST ARE LIKE FATTENED CALVES; YES THEY HAVE TURNED AND FLED TOGETHER; THEY DID NOT STAND FOR THE DAY OF THEIR CALAMITY HAS COME UPON THEM THE TIME OF THEIR PUNISHMENT

SHE MAKES A SOUND LIKE A SERPENT GLIDING AWAY; FOR HER ENEMIES MARCH IN FORCE AND COME AGAINST HER WITH AXES LIKE THOSE WHO FELL TREES

THEY SHALL CUT DOWN HER FOREST DECLARES THE LORD THOUGH IT IS IMPENETRABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN LOCUSTS; THEY ARE WITHOUT NUMBER

THE DAUGHTER OF EGYPT SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME; SHE SHALL BE DELIVERED INTO THE HAND OF A PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH

 THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL SAID BEHOLD I AM BRINGING PUNISHMENT UPON AMON OF THEBES AND PHARAOH AND EGYPT AND HER GODS AND HER KINGS UPON PHARAOH AND THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM

I WILL DELIVER THEM INTO THE HAND OF THOSE WHO SEEK THEIR LIFE INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND HIS OFFICERS

' YOU ALSO O MADMEN SHALL BE BROUGHT TO SILENCE; THE SWORD SHALL PURSUE YOU

HARK

A CRY FROM HORONAIM 'DESOLATION AND GREAT DESTRUCTION

' MOAB IS DESTROYED; HER LITTLE ONES HAVE MADE A CRY

FOR AT THE ASCENT OF LUHITH THEY GO UP WEEPING; FOR AT THE DESCENT OF HORONAIM THEY HAVE HEARD THE DISTRESSED CRY OF DESTRUCTION

FLEE

SAVE YOURSELVES

YOU WILL BE LIKE A JUNIPER IN THE DESERT

FOR BECAUSE YOU TRUSTED IN YOUR WORKS AND YOUR TREASURES YOU ALSO SHALL BE TAKEN; AND CHEMOSH SHALL GO INTO EXILE WITH HIS PRIESTS AND HIS OFFICIALS

THE DESTROYER SHALL COME UPON EVERY CITY AND NO CITY SHALL ESCAPE; THE VALLEY SHALL PERISH AND THE PLAIN SHALL BE DESTROYED AS THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

GIVE WINGS TO MOAB FOR SHE WOULD FLY AWAY; HER CITIES SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION WITH NO INHABITANT IN THEM

CURSED IS HE WHO DOES THE WORK OF THE LORD WITH SLACKNESS AND CURSED IS HE WHO KEEPS BACK HIS SWORD FROM BLOODSHED

MOAB HAS BEEN AT EASE FROM HIS YOUTH AND HAS SETTLED ON HIS DREGS; HE HAS NOT BEEN EMPTIED FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL NOR HAS HE GONE INTO EXILE; SO HIS TASTE REMAINS IN HIM AND HIS SCENT IS NOT CHANGED

THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I SHALL SEND TO HIM POURERS WHO WILL POUR HIM AND EMPTY HIS VESSELS AND BREAK HIS JARS IN PIECES

THEN MOAB SHALL BE ASHAMED OF CHEMOSH AS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WAS ASHAMED OF BETHEL THEIR CONFIDENCE

HOW DO YOU SAY 'WE ARE HEROES AND MIGHTY MEN OF WAR'

THE DESTROYER OF MOAB AND HIS CITIES HAS COME UP AND THE CHOICEST OF HIS YOUNG MEN HAVE GONE DOWN TO SLAUGHTER DECLARES THE KING WHOSE NAME IS THE LORD OF HOSTS

THE CALAMITY OF MOAB IS NEAR AT HAND AND HIS AFFLICTION HASTENS SWIFTLY

GRIEVE FOR HIM ALL YOU WHO ARE AROUND HIM AND ALL WHO KNOW HIS NAME; SAY 'HOW THE MIGHTY SCEPTER IS BROKEN THE GLORIOUS STAFF

' COME DOWN FROM YOUR GLORY AND SIT ON THE PARCHED GROUND O INHABITANT OF DIBON

FOR THE DESTROYER OF MOAB HAS COME UP AGAINST YOU; HE HAS DESTROYED YOUR STRONGHOLDS

STAND BY THE WAY AND WATCH O INHABITANT OF AROER

ASK HIM WHO FLEES AND HER WHO ESCAPES; SAY 'WHAT HAS HAPPENED

' MOAB IS PUT TO SHAME FOR IT IS BROKEN; WAIL AND CRY

TELL IT BESIDE THE ARNON THAT MOAB IS LAID WASTE

JUDGMENT HAS COME UPON THE TABLELAND UPON HOLON AND JAHZAH AND MEPHAATH AND DIBON AND NEBO AND BETHDIBLATHAIM AND KIRIATHAIM AND BETHGAMUL AND BETHMEON AND KERIOTH AND BOZRAH AND ALL THE CITIES OF THE LAND OF MOAB FAR AND NEAR

THE HORN OF MOAB IS CUT OFF AND HIS ARM IS BROKEN DECLARES THE LORD

MAKE HIM DRUNK BECAUSE HE MAGNIFIED HIMSELF AGAINST THE LORD SO THAT MOAB SHALL WALLOW IN HIS VOMIT AND HE TOO SHALL BE HELD IN DERISION

WAS NOT ISRAEL A DERISION TO YOU

WAS HE FOUND AMONG THIEVES THAT WHENEVER YOU SPOKE OF HIM YOU WAGGED YOUR HEAD

LEAVE THE CITIES AND DWELL IN THE ROCK O INHABITANTS OF MOAB

BE LIKE THE DOVE THAT NESTS IN THE SIDES OF THE MOUTH OF A GORGE

WE HAVE HEARD OF THE PRIDE OF MOABHE IS VERY PROUDOF HIS LOFTINESS HIS PRIDE AND HIS ARROGANCE AND THE HAUGHTINESS OF HIS HEART

I KNOW HIS INSOLENCE DECLARES THE LORD; HIS BOASTS ARE FALSE HIS DEEDS ARE FALSE

THEREFORE I WAIL FOR MOAB; I CRY OUT FOR ALL MOAB; FOR THE MEN OF KIRHARESETH I MOURN

MORE THAN FOR JAZER I WEEP FOR YOU O VINE OF SIBMAH

YOUR BRANCHES PASSED OVER THE SEA REACHED TO THE SEA OF JAZER; ON YOUR SUMMER FRUITS AND YOUR GRAPES THE DESTROYER HAS FALLEN

GLADNESS AND JOY HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE FRUITFUL LAND OF MOAB; I HAVE MADE THE WINE CEASE FROM THE WINEPRESSES; NO ONE TREADS THEM WITH SHOUTS OF JOY; THE SHOUTING IS NOT THE SHOUT OF JOY

FROM THE OUTCRY AT HESHBON EVEN TO ELEALEH AS FAR AS JAHAZ THEY UTTER THEIR VOICE FROM ZOAR TO HORONAIM AND EGLATHSHELISHIYAH

FOR THE WATERS OF NIMRIM ALSO HAVE BECOME DESOLATE

AND I WILL BRING TO AN END IN MOAB DECLARES THE LORD HIM WHO OFFERS SACRIFICE IN THE HIGH PLACE AND MAKES OFFERINGS TO HIS GOD

THEREFORE MY HEART MOANS FOR MOAB LIKE A FLUTE AND MY HEART MOANS LIKE A FLUTE FOR THE MEN OF KIRHARESETH

THEREFORE THE RICHES THEY GAINED HAVE PERISHED

FOR EVERY HEAD IS SHAVED AND EVERY BEARD CUT OFF

ON ALL THE HANDS ARE GASHES AND AROUND THE WAIST IS SACKCLOTH

ON ALL THE HOUSETOPS OF MOAB AND IN THE SQUARES THERE IS NOTHING BUT LAMENTATION FOR I HAVE BROKEN MOAB LIKE A VESSEL FOR WHICH NO ONE CARES DECLARES THE LORD

HOW IT IS BROKEN

HOW THEY WAIL

HOW MOAB HAS TURNED HIS BACK IN SHAME

SO MOAB HAS BECOME A DERISION AND A HORROR TO ALL THAT ARE AROUND HIM

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD ONE SHALL FLY SWIFTLY LIKE AN EAGLE AND SPREAD HIS WINGS AGAINST MOAB; THE CITIES SHALL BE TAKEN AND THE STRONGHOLDS SEIZED

THE HEART OF THE WARRIORS OF MOAB SHALL BE IN THAT DAY LIKE THE HEART OF A WOMAN IN HER BIRTH PAINS; MOAB SHALL BE DESTROYED AND BE NO LONGER A PEOPLE BECAUSE HE MAGNIFIED HIMSELF AGAINST THE LORD

TERROR PIT AND SNARE ARE BEFORE YOU O INHABITANT OF MOAB

DECLARES THE LORD

HE WHO FLEES FROM THE TERROR SHALL FALL INTO THE PIT AND HE WHO CLIMBS OUT OF THE PIT SHALL BE CAUGHT IN THE SNARE

FOR I WILL BRING THESE THINGS UPON MOAB THE YEAR OF THEIR PUNISHMENT DECLARES THE LORD

IN THE SHADOW OF HESHBON FUGITIVES STOP WITHOUT STRENGTH FOR FIRE CAME OUT FROM HESHBON FLAME FROM THE HOUSE OF SIHON; IT HAS DESTROYED THE FOREHEAD OF MOAB THE CROWN OF THE SONS OF TUMULT

WOE TO YOU O MOAB

THE PEOPLE OF CHEMOSH ARE UNDONE FOR YOUR SONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE AND YOUR DAUGHTERS INTO CAPTIVITY

YET I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF MOAB IN THE LATTER DAYS DECLARES THE LORD

 THUS FAR IS THE JUDGMENT ON MOAB

CONCERNING THE AMMONITES

THUS SAYS THE LORD HAS ISRAEL NO SONS

HAS HE NO HEIR

WHY THEN HAS MILCOM DISPOSSESSED GAD AND HIS PEOPLE SETTLED IN ITS CITIES

THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL CAUSE THE BATTLE CRY TO BE HEARD AGAINST RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES; IT SHALL BECOME A DESOLATE MOUND AND ITS VILLAGES SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE; THEN ISRAEL SHALL DISPOSSESS THOSE WHO DISPOSSESSED HIM SAYS THE LORD

WAIL O HESHBON FOR AI IS LAID WASTE

CRY OUT O DAUGHTERS OF RABBAH

PUT ON SACKCLOTH LAMENT AND RUN TO AND FRO AMONG THE HEDGES

FOR MILCOM SHALL GO INTO EXILE WITH HIS PRIESTS AND HIS OFFICIALS

WHY DO YOU BOAST OF YOUR VALLEYS O FAITHLESS DAUGHTER WHO TRUSTED IN HER TREASURES SAYING 'WHO WILL COME AGAINST ME

' BEHOLD I WILL BRING TERROR UPON YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS FROM ALL WHO ARE AROUND YOU AND YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN OUT EVERY MAN STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WITH NONE TO GATHER THE FUGITIVES

BUT AFTERWARD I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF THE AMMONITES DECLARES THE LORD

 CONCERNING EDOM

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IS WISDOM NO MORE IN TEMAN

HAS COUNSEL PERISHED FROM THE PRUDENT

HAS THEIR WISDOM VANISHED

FLEE TURN BACK DWELL IN THE DEPTHS O INHABITANTS OF DEDAN

FOR I WILL BRING THE CALAMITY OF ESAU UPON HIM THE TIME WHEN I PUNISH HIM

IF GRAPEGATHERERS CAME TO YOU WOULD THEY NOT LEAVE GLEANINGS

IF THIEVES CAME BY NIGHT WOULD THEY NOT DESTROY ONLY ENOUGH FOR THEMSELVES

BUT I HAVE STRIPPED ESAU BARE; I HAVE UNCOVERED HIS HIDING PLACES AND HE IS NOT ABLE TO CONCEAL HIMSELF

HIS CHILDREN ARE DESTROYED AND HIS BROTHERS AND HIS NEIGHBORS; AND HE IS NO MORE

LEAVE YOUR FATHERLESS CHILDREN; I WILL KEEP THEM ALIVE; AND LET YOUR WIDOWS TRUST IN ME

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD IF THOSE WHO DID NOT DESERVE TO DRINK THE CUP MUST DRINK IT WILL YOU GO UNPUNISHED

YOU SHALL NOT GO UNPUNISHED BUT YOU MUST DRINK

FOR I HAVE SWORN BY MYSELF DECLARES THE LORD THAT BOZRAH SHALL BECOME A HORROR A TAUNT A WASTE AND A CURSE AND ALL HER CITIES SHALL BE PERPETUAL WASTES

 I HAVE HEARD A MESSAGE FROM THE LORD AND AN ENVOY HAS BEEN SENT AMONG THE NATIONS GATHER YOURSELVES TOGETHER AND COME AGAINST HER AND RISE UP FOR BATTLE

FOR BEHOLD I WILL MAKE YOU SMALL AMONG THE NATIONS DESPISED AMONG MANKIND

THE HORROR YOU INSPIRE HAS DECEIVED YOU AND THE PRIDE OF YOUR HEART YOU WHO LIVE IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCK WHO HOLD THE HEIGHT OF THE HILL

THOUGH YOU MAKE YOUR NEST AS HIGH AS THE EAGLE'S I WILL BRING YOU DOWN FROM THERE DECLARES THE LORD

EDOM SHALL BECOME A HORROR

EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY IT WILL BE HORRIFIED AND WILL HISS BECAUSE OF ALL ITS DISASTERS

AS WHEN SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES WERE OVERTHROWN SAYS THE LORD NO MAN SHALL DWELL THERE NO MAN SHALL SOJOURN IN HER

BEHOLD LIKE A LION COMING UP FROM THE JUNGLE OF THE JORDAN AGAINST A PERENNIAL PASTURE I WILL SUDDENLY MAKE HIM RUN AWAY FROM HER

AND I WILL APPOINT OVER HER WHOMEVER I CHOOSE

FOR WHO IS LIKE ME

WHO WILL SUMMON ME

WHAT SHEPHERD CAN STAND BEFORE ME

THEREFORE HEAR THE PLAN THAT THE LORD HAS MADE AGAINST EDOM AND THE PURPOSES THAT HE HAS FORMED AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF TEMAN EVEN THE LITTLE ONES OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE DRAGGED AWAY

SURELY THEIR FOLD SHALL BE APPALLED AT THEIR FATE

AT THE SOUND OF THEIR FALL THE EARTH SHALL TREMBLE; THE SOUND OF THEIR CRY SHALL BE HEARD AT THE RED SEA

BEHOLD ONE SHALL MOUNT UP AND FLY SWIFTLY LIKE AN EAGLE AND SPREAD HIS WINGS AGAINST BOZRAH AND THE HEART OF THE WARRIORS OF EDOM SHALL BE IN THAT DAY LIKE THE HEART OF A WOMAN IN HER BIRTH PAINS

 CONCERNING DAMASCUS HAMATH AND ARPAD ARE CONFOUNDED FOR THEY HAVE HEARD BAD NEWS; THEY MELT IN FEAR THEY ARE TROUBLED LIKE THE SEA THAT CANNOT BE QUIET

DAMASCUS HAS BECOME FEEBLE SHE TURNED TO FLEE AND PANIC SEIZED HER; ANGUISH AND SORROWS HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF HER AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

HOW IS THE FAMOUS CITY NOT FORSAKEN THE CITY OF MY JOY

THEREFORE HER YOUNG MEN SHALL FALL IN HER SQUARES AND ALL HER SOLDIERS SHALL BE DESTROYED IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND I WILL KINDLE A FIRE IN THE WALL OF DAMASCUS AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE STRONGHOLDS OF BENHADAD

 CONCERNING KEDAR AND THE KINGDOMS OF HAZOR THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON STRUCK DOWN

THUS SAYS THE LORD RISE UP ADVANCE AGAINST KEDAR

IN THOSE DAYS AND IN THAT TIME DECLARES THE LORD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH SHALL COME TOGETHER WEEPING AS THEY COME AND THEY SHALL SEEK THE LORD THEIR GOD

THEY SHALL ASK THE WAY TO ZION WITH FACES TURNED TOWARD IT SAYING 'COME LET US JOIN OURSELVES TO THE LORD IN AN EVERLASTING COVENANT THAT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN

A VOICE

THEY FLEE AND ESCAPE FROM THE LAND OF BABYLON TO DECLARE IN ZION THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD OUR GOD VENGEANCE FOR HIS TEMPLE

SUMMON ARCHERS AGAINST BABYLON ALL THOSE WHO BEND THE BOW

ENCAMP AROUND HER; LET NO ONE ESCAPE

REPAY HER ACCORDING TO HER DEEDS; DO TO HER ACCORDING TO ALL THAT SHE HAS DONE

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ARE OPPRESSED AND THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH WITH THEM

ALL WHO TOOK THEM CAPTIVE HAVE HELD THEM FAST; THEY REFUSE TO LET THEM GO

THEIR REDEEMER IS STRONG; THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME

HE WILL SURELY PLEAD THEIR CAUSE THAT HE MAY GIVE REST TO THE EARTH BUT UNREST TO THE INHABITANTS OF BABYLON

A SWORD AGAINST THE CHALDEANS DECLARES THE LORD AND AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF BABYLON AND AGAINST HER OFFICIALS AND HER WISE MEN

A SWORD AGAINST ALL HER TREASURES THAT THEY MAY BE PLUNDERED

A DROUGHT AGAINST HER WATERS THAT THEY MAY BE DRIED UP

FOR IT IS A LAND OF IMAGES AND THEY ARE MAD OVER IDOLS

THEREFORE WILD BEASTS SHALL DWELL WITH HYENAS IN BABYLON AND OSTRICHES SHALL DWELL IN HER

SHE SHALL NEVER AGAIN HAVE PEOPLE NOR BE INHABITED FOR ALL GENERATIONS

AS WHEN GOD OVERTHREW SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES DECLARES THE LORD SO NO MAN SHALL DWELL THERE AND NO SON OF MAN SHALL SOJOURN IN HER

BEHOLD A PEOPLE COMES FROM THE NORTH; A MIGHTY NATION AND MANY KINGS ARE STIRRING FROM THE FARTHEST PARTS OF THE EARTH

THEY LAY HOLD OF BOW AND SPEAR; THEY ARE CRUEL AND HAVE NO MERCY

THE SOUND OF THEM IS LIKE THE ROARING OF THE SEA; THEY RIDE ON HORSES ARRAYED AS A MAN FOR BATTLE AGAINST YOU O DAUGHTER OF BABYLON

THE KING OF BABYLON HEARD THE REPORT OF THEM AND HIS HANDS FELL HELPLESS; ANGUISH SEIZED HIM PAIN AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

BEHOLD LIKE A LION COMING UP FROM THE THICKET OF THE JORDAN AGAINST A PERENNIAL PASTURE I WILL SUDDENLY MAKE THEM RUN AWAY FROM HER AND I WILL APPOINT OVER HER WHOMEVER I CHOOSE

FOR WHO IS LIKE ME

WHO WILL SUMMON ME

WHAT SHEPHERD CAN STAND BEFORE ME

THEREFORE HEAR THE PLAN THAT THE LORD HAS MADE AGAINST BABYLON AND THE PURPOSES THAT HE HAS FORMED AGAINST THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS SURELY THE LITTLE ONES OF THEIR FLOCK SHALL BE DRAGGED AWAY; SURELY THEIR FOLD SHALL BE APPALLED AT THEIR FATE

AT THE SOUND OF THE CAPTURE OF BABYLON THE EARTH SHALL TREMBLE AND HER CRY SHALL BE HEARD AMONG THE NATIONS

THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL STIR UP THE SPIRIT OF A DESTROYER AGAINST BABYLON AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF LEBKAMAI AND I WILL SEND TO BABYLON WINNOWERS AND THEY SHALL WINNOW HER AND THEY SHALL EMPTY HER LAND WHEN THEY COME AGAINST HER FROM EVERY SIDE ON THE DAY OF TROUBLE

LET NOT THE ARCHER BEND HIS BOW AND LET HIM NOT STAND UP IN HIS ARMOR

SPARE NOT HER YOUNG MEN; DEVOTE TO DESTRUCTION ALL HER ARMY

THEY SHALL FALL DOWN SLAIN IN THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS AND WOUNDED IN HER STREETS

FOR ISRAEL AND JUDAH HAVE NOT BEEN FORSAKEN BY THEIR GOD THE LORD OF HOSTS BUT THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS IS FULL OF GUILT AGAINST THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

FLEE FROM THE MIDST OF BABYLON; LET EVERY ONE SAVE HIS LIFE

BE NOT CUT OFF IN HER PUNISHMENT FOR THIS IS THE TIME OF THE LORD'S VENGEANCE THE REPAYMENT HE IS RENDERING HER

BABYLON WAS A GOLDEN CUP IN THE LORD'S HAND MAKING ALL THE EARTH DRUNKEN; THE NATIONS DRANK OF HER WINE; THEREFORE THE NATIONS WENT MAD

SUDDENLY BABYLON HAS FALLEN AND BEEN BROKEN; WAIL FOR HER

TAKE BALM FOR HER PAIN; PERHAPS SHE MAY BE HEALED

WE WOULD HAVE HEALED BABYLON BUT SHE WAS NOT HEALED

FORSAKE HER AND LET US GO EACH TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HER JUDGMENT HAS REACHED UP TO HEAVEN AND HAS BEEN LIFTED UP EVEN TO THE SKIES

THE LORD HAS BROUGHT ABOUT OUR VINDICATION; COME LET US DECLARE IN ZION THE WORK OF THE LORD OUR GOD

SHARPEN THE ARROWS

TAKE UP THE SHIELDS

THE LORD HAS STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF THE KINGS OF THE MEDES BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE CONCERNING BABYLON IS TO DESTROY IT FOR THAT IS THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD THE VENGEANCE FOR HIS TEMPLE

SET UP A STANDARD AGAINST THE WALLS OF BABYLON; MAKE THE WATCH STRONG; SET UP WATCHMEN; PREPARE THE AMBUSHES; FOR THE LORD HAS BOTH PLANNED AND DONE WHAT HE SPOKE CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF BABYLON

O YOU WHO DWELL BY MANY WATERS RICH IN TREASURES YOUR END HAS COME; THE THREAD OF YOUR LIFE IS CUT

THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SWORN BY HIMSELF SURELY I WILL FILL YOU WITH MEN AS MANY AS LOCUSTS AND THEY SHALL RAISE THE SHOUT OF VICTORY OVER YOU

IT IS HE WHO MADE THE EARTH BY HIS POWER WHO ESTABLISHED THE WORLD BY HIS WISDOM AND BY HIS UNDERSTANDING STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS

WHEN HE UTTERS HIS VOICE THERE IS A TUMULT OF WATERS IN THE HEAVENS AND HE MAKES THE MIST RISE FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

HE MAKES LIGHTNING FOR THE RAIN AND HE BRINGS FORTH THE WIND FROM HIS STOREHOUSES

EVERY MAN IS STUPID AND WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE; EVERY GOLDSMITH IS PUT TO SHAME BY HIS IDOLS FOR HIS IMAGES ARE FALSE AND THERE IS NO BREATH IN THEM

THEY ARE WORTHLESS A WORK OF DELUSION; AT THE TIME OF THEIR PUNISHMENT THEY SHALL PERISH

NOT LIKE THESE IS HE WHO IS THE PORTION OF JACOB FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO FORMED ALL THINGS AND ISRAEL IS THE TRIBE OF HIS INHERITANCE; THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME

YOU ARE MY HAMMER AND WEAPON OF WAR WITH YOU I BREAK NATIONS IN PIECES; WITH YOU I DESTROY KINGDOMS; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE CHARIOT AND THE CHARIOTEER; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES MAN AND WOMAN; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE OLD MAN AND THE YOUTH; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE YOUNG MAN AND THE YOUNG WOMAN; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE SHEPHERD AND HIS FLOCK; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES THE FARMER AND HIS TEAM; WITH YOU I BREAK IN PIECES GOVERNORS AND COMMANDERS

I WILL REPAY BABYLON AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF CHALDEA BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES FOR ALL THE EVIL THAT THEY HAVE DONE IN ZION DECLARES THE LORD

BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU O DESTROYING MOUNTAIN DECLARES THE LORD WHICH DESTROYS THE WHOLE EARTH; I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST YOU AND ROLL YOU DOWN FROM THE CRAGS AND MAKE YOU A BURNT MOUNTAIN

NO STONE SHALL BE TAKEN FROM YOU FOR A CORNER AND NO STONE FOR A FOUNDATION BUT YOU SHALL BE A PERPETUAL WASTE DECLARES THE LORD

SET UP A STANDARD ON THE EARTH; BLOW THE TRUMPET AMONG THE NATIONS; PREPARE THE NATIONS FOR WAR AGAINST HER; SUMMON AGAINST HER THE KINGDOMS ARARAT MINNI AND ASHKENAZ; APPOINT A MARSHAL AGAINST HER; BRING UP HORSES LIKE BRISTLING LOCUSTS

PREPARE THE NATIONS FOR WAR AGAINST HER THE KINGS OF THE MEDES WITH THEIR GOVERNORS AND DEPUTIES AND EVERY LAND UNDER THEIR DOMINION

THE LAND TREMBLES AND WRITHES IN PAIN FOR THE LORD'S PURPOSES AGAINST BABYLON STAND TO MAKE THE LAND OF BABYLON A DESOLATION WITHOUT INHABITANT

THE WARRIORS OF BABYLON HAVE CEASED FIGHTING; THEY REMAIN IN THEIR STRONGHOLDS; THEIR STRENGTH HAS FAILED; THEY HAVE BECOME WOMEN; HER DWELLINGS ARE ON FIRE; HER BARS ARE BROKEN

ONE RUNNER RUNS TO MEET ANOTHER AND ONE MESSENGER TO MEET ANOTHER TO TELL THE KING OF BABYLON THAT HIS CITY IS TAKEN ON EVERY SIDE; THE FORDS HAVE BEEN SEIZED THE MARSHES ARE BURNED WITH FIRE AND THE SOLDIERS ARE IN PANIC

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL THE DAUGHTER OF BABYLON IS LIKE A THRESHING FLOOR AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS TRODDEN; YET A LITTLE WHILE AND THE TIME OF HER HARVEST WILL COME

 NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING OF BABYLON HAS DEVOURED ME; HE HAS CRUSHED ME; HE HAS MADE ME AN EMPTY VESSEL; HE HAS SWALLOWED ME LIKE A MONSTER; HE HAS FILLED HIS STOMACH WITH MY DELICACIES; HE HAS RINSED ME OUT

THE VIOLENCE DONE TO ME AND TO MY KINSMEN BE UPON BABYLON LET THE INHABITANT OF ZION SAY

MY BLOOD BE UPON THE INHABITANTS OF CHALDEA LET JERUSALEM SAY

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL PLEAD YOUR CAUSE AND TAKE VENGEANCE FOR YOU

I WILL DRY UP HER SEA AND MAKE HER FOUNTAIN DRY AND BABYLON SHALL BECOME A HEAP OF RUINS THE HAUNT OF JACKALS A HORROR AND A HISSING WITHOUT INHABITANT

THEY SHALL ROAR TOGETHER LIKE LIONS; THEY SHALL GROWL LIKE LIONS' CUBS

WHILE THEY ARE INFLAMED I WILL PREPARE THEM A FEAST AND MAKE THEM DRUNK THAT THEY MAY BECOME MERRY THEN SLEEP A PERPETUAL SLEEP AND NOT WAKE DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL BRING THEM DOWN LIKE LAMBS TO THE SLAUGHTER LIKE RAMS AND MALE GOATS

HOW BABYLON IS TAKEN THE PRAISE OF THE WHOLE EARTH SEIZED

HOW BABYLON HAS BECOME A HORROR AMONG THE NATIONS

THE SEA HAS COME UP ON BABYLON; SHE IS COVERED WITH ITS TUMULTUOUS WAVES

HER CITIES HAVE BECOME A HORROR A LAND OF DROUGHT AND A DESERT A LAND IN WHICH NO ONE DWELLS AND THROUGH WHICH NO SON OF MAN PASSES

AND I WILL PUNISH BEL IN BABYLON AND TAKE OUT OF HIS MOUTH WHAT HE HAS SWALLOWED

THE NATIONS SHALL NO LONGER FLOW TO HIM; THE WALL OF BABYLON HAS FALLEN

GO OUT OF THE MIDST OF HER MY PEOPLE

LET EVERY ONE SAVE HIS LIFE FROM THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD

LET NOT YOUR HEART FAINT AND BE NOT FEARFUL AT THE REPORT HEARD IN THE LAND WHEN A REPORT COMES IN ONE YEAR AND AFTERWARD A REPORT IN ANOTHER YEAR AND VIOLENCE IS IN THE LAND AND RULER IS AGAINST RULER

THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN I WILL PUNISH THE IMAGES OF BABYLON; HER WHOLE LAND SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME AND ALL HER SLAIN SHALL FALL IN THE MIDST OF HER

THEN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM SHALL SING FOR JOY OVER BABYLON FOR THE DESTROYERS SHALL COME AGAINST THEM OUT OF THE NORTH DECLARES THE LORD

BABYLON MUST FALL FOR THE SLAIN OF ISRAEL JUST AS FOR BABYLON HAVE FALLEN THE SLAIN OF ALL THE EARTH

YOU WHO HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE SWORD GO DO NOT STAND STILL

REMEMBER THE LORD FROM FAR AWAY AND LET JERUSALEM COME INTO YOUR MIND 'WE ARE PUT TO SHAME FOR WE HAVE HEARD REPROACH; DISHONOR HAS COVERED OUR FACE FOR FOREIGNERS HAVE COME INTO THE HOLY PLACES OF THE LORD'S HOUSE

' THEREFORE BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENT UPON HER IMAGES AND THROUGH ALL HER LAND THE WOUNDED SHALL GROAN

THOUGH BABYLON SHOULD MOUNT UP TO HEAVEN AND THOUGH SHE SHOULD FORTIFY HER STRONG HEIGHT YET DESTROYERS WOULD COME FROM ME AGAINST HER DECLARES THE LORD

A VOICE

A CRY FROM BABYLON

THE NOISE OF GREAT DESTRUCTION FROM THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS

FOR THE LORD IS LAYING BABYLON WASTE AND STILLING HER MIGHTY VOICE

THEIR WAVES ROAR LIKE MANY WATERS; THE NOISE OF THEIR VOICE IS RAISED FOR A DESTROYER HAS COME UPON HER UPON BABYLON; HER WARRIORS ARE TAKEN; THEIR BOWS ARE BROKEN IN PIECES FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF RECOMPENSE; HE WILL SURELY REPAY

I WILL MAKE DRUNK HER OFFICIALS AND HER WISE MEN HER GOVERNORS HER COMMANDERS AND HER WARRIORS; THEY SHALL SLEEP A PERPETUAL SLEEP AND NOT WAKE DECLARES THE KING WHOSE NAME IS THE LORD OF HOSTS

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE BROAD WALL OF BABYLON SHALL BE LEVELED TO THE GROUND AND HER HIGH GATES SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE

THE PEOPLES LABOR FOR NOTHING AND THE NATIONS WEARY THEMSELVES ONLY FOR FIRE

 THE WORD THAT JEREMIAH THE PROPHET COMMANDED SERAIAH THE SON OF NERIAH SON OF MAHSEIAH WHEN HE WENT WITH ZEDEKIAH KING OF JUDAH TO BABYLON IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN

SERAIAH WAS THE QUARTERMASTER

JEREMIAH WROTE IN A BOOK ALL THE DISASTER THAT SHOULD COME UPON BABYLON ALL THESE WORDS THAT ARE WRITTEN CONCERNING BABYLON

AND JEREMIAH SAID TO SERAIAH WHEN YOU COME TO BABYLON SEE THAT YOU READ ALL THESE WORDS AND SAY 'O LORD YOU HAVE SAID CONCERNING THIS PLACE THAT YOU WILL CUT IT OFF SO THAT NOTHING SHALL DWELL IN IT NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST AND IT SHALL BE DESOLATE FOREVER

' WHEN YOU FINISH READING THIS BOOK TIE A STONE TO IT AND CAST IT INTO THE MIDST OF THE EUPHRATES AND SAY 'THUS SHALL BABYLON SINK TO RISE NO MORE BECAUSE OF THE DISASTER THAT I AM BRINGING UPON HER AND THEY SHALL BECOME EXHAUSTED

'THUS FAR ARE THE WORDS OF JEREMIAH

ZEDEKIAH WAS TWENTYONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING; AND HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS HAMUTAL THE DAUGHTER OF JEREMIAH OF LIBNAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT JEHOIAKIM HAD DONE

FOR BECAUSE OF THE ANGER OF THE LORD THINGS CAME TO THE POINT IN JERUSALEM AND JUDAH THAT HE CAST THEM OUT FROM HIS PRESENCE

AND ZEDEKIAH REBELLED AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON

AND IN THE NINTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME WITH ALL HIS ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM AND LAID SIEGE TO IT

AND THEY BUILT SIEGEWORKS ALL AROUND IT

SO THE CITY WAS BESIEGED TILL THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF KING ZEDEKIAH

ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE FOURTH MONTH THE FAMINE WAS SO SEVERE IN THE CITY THAT THERE WAS NO FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

THEN A BREACH WAS MADE IN THE CITY AND ALL THE MEN OF WAR FLED AND WENT OUT FROM THE CITY BY NIGHT BY THE WAY OF A GATE BETWEEN THE TWO WALLS BY THE KING'S GARDEN WHILE THE CHALDEANS WERE AROUND THE CITY

AND THEY WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARABAH

BUT THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS PURSUED THE KING AND OVERTOOK ZEDEKIAH IN THE PLAINS OF JERICHO

AND ALL HIS ARMY WAS SCATTERED FROM HIM

THEN THEY CAPTURED THE KING AND BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE KING OF BABYLON AT RIBLAH IN THE LAND OF HAMATH AND HE PASSED SENTENCE ON HIM

THE KING OF BABYLON SLAUGHTERED THE SONS OF ZEDEKIAH BEFORE HIS EYES AND ALSO SLAUGHTERED ALL THE OFFICIALS OF JUDAH AT RIBLAH

HE PUT OUT THE EYES OF ZEDEKIAH AND BOUND HIM IN CHAINS AND THE KING OF BABYLON TOOK HIM TO BABYLON AND PUT HIM IN PRISON TILL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH

IN THE FIFTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTHTHAT WAS THE NINETEENTH YEAR OF KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLONNEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE BODYGUARD WHO SERVED THE KING OF BABYLON ENTERED JERUSALEM

AND HE BURNED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE AND ALL THE HOUSES OF JERUSALEM; EVERY GREAT HOUSE HE BURNED DOWN

AND ALL THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS WHO WERE WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD BROKE DOWN ALL THE WALLS AROUND JERUSALEM

AND NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE SOME OF THE POOREST OF THE PEOPLE AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT IN THE CITY AND THE DESERTERS WHO HAD DESERTED TO THE KING OF BABYLON TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE ARTISANS

BUT NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD LEFT SOME OF THE POOREST OF THE LAND TO BE VINEDRESSERS AND PLOWMEN

AND THE PILLARS OF BRONZE THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE STANDS AND THE BRONZE SEA THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE CHALDEANS BROKE IN PIECES AND CARRIED ALL THE BRONZE TO BABYLON

AND THEY TOOK AWAY THE POTS AND THE SHOVELS AND THE SNUFFERS AND THE BASINS AND THE DISHES FOR INCENSE AND ALL THE VESSELS OF BRONZE USED IN THE TEMPLE SERVICE; ALSO THE SMALL BOWLS AND THE FIRE PANS AND THE BASINS AND THE POTS AND THE LAMPSTANDS AND THE DISHES FOR INCENSE AND THE BOWLS FOR DRINK OFFERINGS

WHAT WAS OF GOLD THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK AWAY AS GOLD AND WHAT WAS OF SILVER AS SILVER

AS FOR THE TWO PILLARS THE ONE SEA THE TWELVE BRONZE BULLS THAT WERE UNDER THE SEA AND THE STANDS WHICH SOLOMON THE KING HAD MADE FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE BRONZE OF ALL THESE THINGS WAS BEYOND WEIGHT

AS FOR THE PILLARS THE HEIGHT OF THE ONE PILLAR WAS EIGHTEEN CUBITS ITS CIRCUMFERENCE WAS TWELVE CUBITS AND ITS THICKNESS WAS FOUR FINGERS AND IT WAS HOLLOW

ON IT WAS A CAPITAL OF BRONZE

THE HEIGHT OF THE ONE CAPITAL WAS FIVE CUBITS

A NETWORK AND POMEGRANATES ALL OF BRONZE WERE AROUND THE CAPITAL

AND THE SECOND PILLAR HAD THE SAME WITH POMEGRANATES

THERE WERE NINETYSIX POMEGRANATES ON THE SIDES; ALL THE POMEGRANATES WERE A HUNDRED UPON THE NETWORK ALL AROUND

AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK SERAIAH THE CHIEF PRIEST AND ZEPHANIAH THE SECOND PRIEST AND THE THREE KEEPERS OF THE THRESHOLD; AND FROM THE CITY HE TOOK AN OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN IN COMMAND OF THE MEN OF WAR AND SEVEN MEN OF THE KING'S COUNCIL WHO WERE FOUND IN THE CITY; AND THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WHO MUSTERED THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND; AND SIXTY MEN OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WHO WERE FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY

AND NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE KING OF BABYLON AT RIBLAH

AND THE KING OF BABYLON STRUCK THEM DOWN AND PUT THEM TO DEATH AT RIBLAH IN THE LAND OF HAMATH

SO JUDAH WAS TAKEN INTO EXILE OUT OF ITS LAND

THIS IS THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE IN THE SEVENTH YEAR  JUDEANS; IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR HE CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE FROM JERUSALEM  PERSONS; IN THE TWENTYTHIRD YEAR OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE OF THE JUDEANS  PERSONS; ALL THE PERSONS WERE 

AND IN THE THIRTYSEVENTH YEAR OF THE EXILE OF JEHOIACHIN KING OF JUDAH IN THE TWELFTH MONTH ON THE TWENTYFIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH EVILMERODACH KING OF BABYLON IN THE YEAR THAT HE BECAME KING LIFTED UP THE HEAD OF JEHOIACHIN KING OF JUDAH AND BROUGHT HIM OUT OF PRISON

AND HE SPOKE KINDLY TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A SEAT ABOVE THE SEATS OF THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM IN BABYLON

SO JEHOIACHIN PUT OFF HIS PRISON GARMENTS

AND EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE DINED REGULARLY AT THE KING'S TABLE AND FOR HIS ALLOWANCE A REGULAR ALLOWANCE WAS GIVEN HIM BY THE KING ACCORDING TO HIS DAILY NEED UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AS LONG AS HE LIVED

EPHESIANSPAUL AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS BY THE WILL OF GODTO THE SAINTS WHO ARE IN EPHESUS AND ARE FAITHFUL IN CHRIST JESUS GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO HAS BLESSED US IN CHRIST WITH EVERY SPIRITUAL BLESSING IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES EVEN AS HE CHOSE US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THAT WE SHOULD BE HOLY AND BLAMELESS BEFORE HIM

IN LOVE HE PREDESTINED US FOR ADOPTION THROUGH JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE PURPOSE OF HIS WILL TO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORIOUS GRACE WITH WHICH HE HAS BLESSED US IN THE BELOVED

IN HIM WE HAVE REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR TRESPASSES ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GRACE WHICH HE LAVISHED UPON US IN ALL WISDOM AND INSIGHT MAKING KNOWN TO US THE MYSTERY OF HIS WILL ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE WHICH HE SET FORTH IN CHRIST AS A PLAN FOR THE FULLNESS OF TIME TO UNITE ALL THINGS IN HIM THINGS IN HEAVEN AND THINGS ON EARTH

IN HIM WE HAVE OBTAINED AN INHERITANCE HAVING BEEN PREDESTINED ACCORDING TO THE PURPOSE OF HIM WHO WORKS ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO THE COUNSEL OF HIS WILL SO THAT WE WHO WERE THE FIRST TO HOPE IN CHRIST MIGHT BE TO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORY

IN HIM YOU ALSO WHEN YOU HEARD THE WORD OF TRUTH THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION AND BELIEVED IN HIM WERE SEALED WITH THE PROMISED HOLY SPIRIT WHO IS THE GUARANTEE OF OUR INHERITANCE UNTIL WE ACQUIRE POSSESSION OF IT TO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORY

FOR THIS REASON BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD OF YOUR FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS AND YOUR LOVE TOWARD ALL THE SAINTS I DO NOT CEASE TO GIVE THANKS FOR YOU REMEMBERING YOU IN MY PRAYERS THAT THE GOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THE FATHER OF GLORY MAY GIVE YOU A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND OF REVELATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM HAVING THE EYES OF YOUR HEARTS ENLIGHTENED THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHAT IS THE HOPE TO WHICH HE HAS CALLED YOU WHAT ARE THE RICHES OF HIS GLORIOUS INHERITANCE IN THE SAINTS AND WHAT IS THE IMMEASURABLE GREATNESS OF HIS POWER TOWARD US WHO BELIEVE ACCORDING TO THE WORKING OF HIS GREAT MIGHT THAT HE WORKED IN CHRIST WHEN HE RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD AND SEATED HIM AT HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES FAR ABOVE ALL RULE AND AUTHORITY AND POWER AND DOMINION AND ABOVE EVERY NAME THAT IS NAMED NOT ONLY IN THIS AGE BUT ALSO IN THE ONE TO COME

AND HE PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET AND GAVE HIM AS HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH WHICH IS HIS BODY THE FULLNESS OF HIM WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL

AND YOU WERE DEAD IN THE TRESPASSES AND SINS IN WHICH YOU ONCE WALKED FOLLOWING THE COURSE OF THIS WORLD FOLLOWING THE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR THE SPIRIT THAT IS NOW AT WORK IN THE SONS OF DISOBEDIENCE AMONG WHOM WE ALL ONCE LIVED IN THE PASSIONS OF OUR FLESH CARRYING OUT THE DESIRES OF THE BODY AND THE MIND AND WERE BY NATURE CHILDREN OF WRATH LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND

BUT GOD BEING RICH IN MERCY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT LOVE WITH WHICH HE LOVED US EVEN WHEN WE WERE DEAD IN OUR TRESPASSES MADE US ALIVE TOGETHER WITH CHRISTBY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED AND RAISED US UP WITH HIM AND SEATED US WITH HIM IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS SO THAT IN THE COMING AGES HE MIGHT SHOW THE IMMEASURABLE RICHES OF HIS GRACE IN KINDNESS TOWARD US IN CHRIST JESUS

FOR BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED THROUGH FAITH

AND THIS IS NOT YOUR OWN DOING; IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD NOT A RESULT OF WORKS SO THAT NO ONE MAY BOAST

FOR WE ARE HIS WORKMANSHIP CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS FOR GOOD WORKS WHICH GOD PREPARED BEFOREHAND THAT WE SHOULD WALK IN THEM

THEREFORE REMEMBER THAT AT ONE TIME YOU GENTILES IN THE FLESH CALLED THE UNCIRCUMCISION BY WHAT IS CALLED THE CIRCUMCISION WHICH IS MADE IN THE FLESH BY HANDS REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE AT THAT TIME SEPARATED FROM CHRIST ALIENATED FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF ISRAEL AND STRANGERS TO THE COVENANTS OF PROMISE HAVING NO HOPE AND WITHOUT GOD IN THE WORLD

BUT NOW IN CHRIST JESUS YOU WHO ONCE WERE FAR OFF HAVE BEEN BROUGHT NEAR BY THE BLOOD OF CHRIST

FOR HE HIMSELF IS OUR PEACE WHO HAS MADE US BOTH ONE AND HAS BROKEN DOWN IN HIS FLESH THE DIVIDING WALL OF HOSTILITY BY ABOLISHING THE LAW OF COMMANDMENTS AND ORDINANCES THAT HE MIGHT CREATE IN HIMSELF ONE NEW MAN IN PLACE OF THE TWO SO MAKING PEACE AND MIGHT RECONCILE US BOTH TO GOD IN ONE BODY THROUGH THE CROSS THEREBY KILLING THE HOSTILITY

AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR OFF AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR

FOR THROUGH HIM WE BOTH HAVE ACCESS IN ONE SPIRIT TO THE FATHER

SO THEN YOU ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS AND ALIENS BUT YOU ARE FELLOW CITIZENS WITH THE SAINTS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE APOSTLES AND PROPHETS CHRIST JESUS HIMSELF BEING THE CORNERSTONE IN WHOM THE WHOLE STRUCTURE BEING JOINED TOGETHER GROWS INTO A HOLY TEMPLE IN THE LORD

IN HIM YOU ALSO ARE BEING BUILT TOGETHER INTO A DWELLING PLACE FOR GOD BY THE SPIRIT

FOR THIS REASON I PAUL A PRISONER FOR CHRIST JESUS ON BEHALF OF YOU GENTILES ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOD'S GRACE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME FOR YOU HOW THE MYSTERY WAS MADE KNOWN TO ME BY REVELATION AS I HAVE WRITTEN BRIEFLY

WHEN YOU READ THIS YOU CAN PERCEIVE MY INSIGHT INTO THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST WHICH WAS NOT MADE KNOWN TO THE SONS OF MEN IN OTHER GENERATIONS AS IT HAS NOW BEEN REVEALED TO HIS HOLY APOSTLES AND PROPHETS BY THE SPIRIT

THIS MYSTERY IS THAT THE GENTILES ARE FELLOW HEIRS MEMBERS OF THE SAME BODY AND PARTAKERS OF THE PROMISE IN CHRIST JESUS THROUGH THE GOSPEL

OF THIS GOSPEL I WAS MADE A MINISTER ACCORDING TO THE GIFT OF GOD'S GRACE WHICH WAS GIVEN ME BY THE WORKING OF HIS POWER

TO ME THOUGH I AM THE VERY LEAST OF ALL THE SAINTS THIS GRACE WAS GIVEN TO PREACH TO THE GENTILES THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST AND TO BRING TO LIGHT FOR EVERYONE WHAT IS THE PLAN OF THE MYSTERY HIDDEN FOR AGES IN GOD WHO CREATED ALL THINGS SO THAT THROUGH THE CHURCH THE MANIFOLD WISDOM OF GOD MIGHT NOW BE MADE KNOWN TO THE RULERS AND AUTHORITIES IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES

THIS WAS ACCORDING TO THE ETERNAL PURPOSE THAT HE HAS REALIZED IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD IN WHOM WE HAVE BOLDNESS AND ACCESS WITH CONFIDENCE THROUGH OUR FAITH IN HIM

SO I ASK YOU NOT TO LOSE HEART OVER WHAT I AM SUFFERING FOR YOU WHICH IS YOUR GLORY

FOR THIS REASON I BOW MY KNEES BEFORE THE FATHER FROM WHOM EVERY FAMILY IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH IS NAMED THAT ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY HE MAY GRANT YOU TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH POWER THROUGH HIS SPIRIT IN YOUR INNER BEING SO THAT CHRIST MAY DWELL IN YOUR HEARTS THROUGH FAITHTHAT YOU BEING ROOTED AND GROUNDED IN LOVE MAY HAVE STRENGTH TO COMPREHEND WITH ALL THE SAINTS WHAT IS THE BREADTH AND LENGTH AND HEIGHT AND DEPTH AND TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST THAT SURPASSES KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY BE FILLED WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD

NOW TO HIM WHO IS ABLE TO DO FAR MORE ABUNDANTLY THAN ALL THAT WE ASK OR THINK ACCORDING TO THE POWER AT WORK WITHIN US TO HIM BE GLORY IN THE CHURCH AND IN CHRIST JESUS THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

I THEREFORE A PRISONER FOR THE LORD URGE YOU TO WALK IN A MANNER WORTHY OF THE CALLING TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED WITH ALL HUMILITY AND GENTLENESS WITH PATIENCE BEARING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN LOVE EAGER TO MAINTAIN THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BOND OF PEACE

THERE IS ONE BODY AND ONE SPIRITJUST AS YOU WERE CALLED TO THE ONE HOPE THAT BELONGS TO YOUR CALL ONE LORD ONE FAITH ONE BAPTISM ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL WHO IS OVER ALL AND THROUGH ALL AND IN ALL

BUT GRACE WAS GIVEN TO EACH ONE OF US ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF CHRIST'S GIFT

THEREFORE IT SAYS WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH HE LED A HOST OF CAPTIVES AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN

 IN SAYING HE ASCENDED WHAT DOES IT MEAN BUT THAT HE HAD ALSO DESCENDED INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH

HE WHO DESCENDED IS THE ONE WHO ALSO ASCENDED FAR ABOVE ALL THE HEAVENS THAT HE MIGHT FILL ALL THINGS

 AND HE GAVE THE APOSTLES THE PROPHETS THE EVANGELISTS THE PASTORS AND TEACHERS TO EQUIP THE SAINTS FOR THE WORK OF MINISTRY FOR BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST UNTIL WE ALL ATTAIN TO THE UNITY OF THE FAITH AND OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SON OF GOD TO MATURE MANHOOD TO THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST SO THAT WE MAY NO LONGER BE CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO BY THE WAVES AND CARRIED ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE BY HUMAN CUNNING BY CRAFTINESS IN DECEITFUL SCHEMES

RATHER SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE WE ARE TO GROW UP IN EVERY WAY INTO HIM WHO IS THE HEAD INTO CHRIST FROM WHOM THE WHOLE BODY JOINED AND HELD TOGETHER BY EVERY JOINT WITH WHICH IT IS EQUIPPED WHEN EACH PART IS WORKING PROPERLY MAKES THE BODY GROW SO THAT IT BUILDS ITSELF UP IN LOVE

NOW THIS I SAY AND TESTIFY IN THE LORD THAT YOU MUST NO LONGER WALK AS THE GENTILES DO IN THE FUTILITY OF THEIR MINDS

THEY ARE DARKENED IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ALIENATED FROM THE LIFE OF GOD BECAUSE OF THE IGNORANCE THAT IS IN THEM DUE TO THEIR HARDNESS OF HEART

THEY HAVE BECOME CALLOUS AND HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES UP TO SENSUALITY GREEDY TO PRACTICE EVERY KIND OF IMPURITY

BUT THAT IS NOT THE WAY YOU LEARNED CHRIST

 ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT HIM AND WERE TAUGHT IN HIM AS THE TRUTH IS IN JESUS TO PUT OFF YOUR OLD SELF WHICH BELONGS TO YOUR FORMER MANNER OF LIFE AND IS CORRUPT THROUGH DECEITFUL DESIRES AND TO BE RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF YOUR MINDS AND TO PUT ON THE NEW SELF CREATED AFTER THE LIKENESS OF GOD IN TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS

THEREFORE HAVING PUT AWAY FALSEHOOD LET EACH ONE OF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH WITH HIS NEIGHBOR FOR WE ARE MEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER

BE ANGRY AND DO NOT SIN; DO NOT LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON YOUR ANGER AND GIVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEVIL

LET THE THIEF NO LONGER STEAL BUT RATHER LET HIM LABOR DOING HONEST WORK WITH HIS OWN HANDS SO THAT HE MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE WITH ANYONE IN NEED

LET NO CORRUPTING TALK COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS BUT ONLY SUCH AS IS GOOD FOR BUILDING UP AS FITS THE OCCASION THAT IT MAY GIVE GRACE TO THOSE WHO HEAR

AND DO NOT GRIEVE THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD BY WHOM YOU WERE SEALED FOR THE DAY OF REDEMPTION

LET ALL BITTERNESS AND WRATH AND ANGER AND CLAMOR AND SLANDER BE PUT AWAY FROM YOU ALONG WITH ALL MALICE

BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER TENDERHEARTED FORGIVING ONE ANOTHER AS GOD IN CHRIST FORGAVE YOU

THEREFORE BE IMITATORS OF GOD AS BELOVED CHILDREN

AND WALK IN LOVE AS CHRIST LOVED US AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR US A FRAGRANT OFFERING AND SACRIFICE TO GOD

BUT SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND ALL IMPURITY OR COVETOUSNESS MUST NOT EVEN BE NAMED AMONG YOU AS IS PROPER AMONG SAINTS

LET THERE BE NO FILTHINESS NOR FOOLISH TALK NOR CRUDE JOKING WHICH ARE OUT OF PLACE BUT INSTEAD LET THERE BE THANKSGIVING

FOR YOU MAY BE SURE OF THIS THAT EVERYONE WHO IS SEXUALLY IMMORAL OR IMPURE OR WHO IS COVETOUS THAT IS AN IDOLATER HAS NO INHERITANCE IN THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST AND GOD

LET NO ONE DECEIVE YOU WITH EMPTY WORDS FOR BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS THE WRATH OF GOD COMES UPON THE SONS OF DISOBEDIENCE

THEREFORE DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM; FOR AT ONE TIME YOU WERE DARKNESS BUT NOW YOU ARE LIGHT IN THE LORD

WALK AS CHILDREN OF LIGHT FOR THE FRUIT OF LIGHT IS FOUND IN ALL THAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT AND TRUE AND TRY TO DISCERN WHAT IS PLEASING TO THE LORD

TAKE NO PART IN THE UNFRUITFUL WORKS OF DARKNESS BUT INSTEAD EXPOSE THEM

FOR IT IS SHAMEFUL EVEN TO SPEAK OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO IN SECRET

BUT WHEN ANYTHING IS EXPOSED BY THE LIGHT IT BECOMES VISIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT BECOMES VISIBLE IS LIGHT

THEREFORE IT SAYS AWAKE O SLEEPER AND ARISE FROM THE DEAD AND CHRIST WILL SHINE ON YOU

 LOOK CAREFULLY THEN HOW YOU WALK NOT AS UNWISE BUT AS WISE MAKING THE BEST USE OF THE TIME BECAUSE THE DAYS ARE EVIL

THEREFORE DO NOT BE FOOLISH BUT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WILL OF THE LORD IS

AND DO NOT GET DRUNK WITH WINE FOR THAT IS DEBAUCHERY BUT BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT ADDRESSING ONE ANOTHER IN PSALMS AND HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS SINGING AND MAKING MELODY TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART GIVING THANKS ALWAYS AND FOR EVERYTHING TO GOD THE FATHER IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST SUBMITTING TO ONE ANOTHER OUT OF REVERENCE FOR CHRIST

WIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS AS TO THE LORD

FOR THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF THE WIFE EVEN AS CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH HIS BODY AND IS HIMSELF ITS SAVIOR

NOW AS THE CHURCH SUBMITS TO CHRIST SO ALSO WIVES SHOULD SUBMIT IN EVERYTHING TO THEIR HUSBANDS

HUSBANDS LOVE YOUR WIVES AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR HER THAT HE MIGHT SANCTIFY HER HAVING CLEANSED HER BY THE WASHING OF WATER WITH THE WORD SO THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT THE CHURCH TO HIMSELF IN SPLENDOR WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE OR ANY SUCH THING THAT SHE MIGHT BE HOLY AND WITHOUT BLEMISH

IN THE SAME WAY HUSBANDS SHOULD LOVE THEIR WIVES AS THEIR OWN BODIES

HE WHO LOVES HIS WIFE LOVES HIMSELF

FOR NO ONE EVER HATED HIS OWN FLESH BUT NOURISHES AND CHERISHES IT JUST AS CHRIST DOES THE CHURCH BECAUSE WE ARE MEMBERS OF HIS BODY

THEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND HOLD FAST TO HIS WIFE AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH

 THIS MYSTERY IS PROFOUND AND I AM SAYING THAT IT REFERS TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH

HOWEVER LET EACH ONE OF YOU LOVE HIS WIFE AS HIMSELF AND LET THE WIFE SEE THAT SHE RESPECTS HER HUSBAND

CHILDREN OBEY YOUR PARENTS IN THE LORD FOR THIS IS RIGHT

HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER THIS IS THE FIRST COMMANDMENT WITH A PROMISE THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH YOU AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG IN THE LAND

 FATHERS DO NOT PROVOKE YOUR CHILDREN TO ANGER BUT BRING THEM UP IN THE DISCIPLINE AND INSTRUCTION OF THE LORD

SLAVES OBEY YOUR EARTHLY MASTERS WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING WITH A SINCERE HEART AS YOU WOULD CHRIST NOT BY THE WAY OF EYESERVICE AS PEOPLEPLEASERS BUT AS SERVANTS OF CHRIST DOING THE WILL OF GOD FROM THE HEART RENDERING SERVICE WITH A GOOD WILL AS TO THE LORD AND NOT TO MAN KNOWING THAT WHATEVER GOOD ANYONE DOES THIS HE WILL RECEIVE BACK FROM THE LORD WHETHER HE IS A SLAVE OR FREE

MASTERS DO THE SAME TO THEM AND STOP YOUR THREATENING KNOWING THAT HE WHO IS BOTH THEIR MASTER AND YOURS IS IN HEAVEN AND THAT THERE IS NO PARTIALITY WITH HIM

FINALLY BE STRONG IN THE LORD AND IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS MIGHT

PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST THE SCHEMES OF THE DEVIL

FOR WE DO NOT WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST THE RULERS AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE COSMIC POWERS OVER THIS PRESENT DARKNESS AGAINST THE SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES

THEREFORE TAKE UP THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND IN THE EVIL DAY AND HAVING DONE ALL TO STAND FIRM

STAND THEREFORE HAVING FASTENED ON THE BELT OF TRUTH AND HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND AS SHOES FOR YOUR FEET HAVING PUT ON THE READINESS GIVEN BY THE GOSPEL OF PEACE

IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE UP THE SHIELD OF FAITH WITH WHICH YOU CAN EXTINGUISH ALL THE FLAMING DARTS OF THE EVIL ONE; AND TAKE THE HELMET OF SALVATION AND THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD PRAYING AT ALL TIMES IN THE SPIRIT WITH ALL PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION

TO THAT END KEEP ALERT WITH ALL PERSEVERANCE MAKING SUPPLICATION FOR ALL THE SAINTS AND ALSO FOR ME THAT WORDS MAY BE GIVEN TO ME IN OPENING MY MOUTH BOLDLY TO PROCLAIM THE MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL FOR WHICH I AM AN AMBASSADOR IN CHAINS THAT I MAY DECLARE IT BOLDLY AS I OUGHT TO SPEAK

SO THAT YOU ALSO MAY KNOW HOW I AM AND WHAT I AM DOING TYCHICUS THE BELOVED BROTHER AND FAITHFUL MINISTER IN THE LORD WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING

I HAVE SENT HIM TO YOU FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE THAT YOU MAY KNOW HOW WE ARE AND THAT HE MAY ENCOURAGE YOUR HEARTS

PEACE BE TO THE BROTHERS AND LOVE WITH FAITH FROM GOD THE FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

GRACE BE WITH ALL WHO LOVE OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WITH LOVE INCORRUPTIBLE

HABAKKUKTHE ORACLE THAT HABAKKUK THE PROPHET SAW

O LORD HOW LONG SHALL I CRY FOR HELP AND YOU WILL NOT HEAR

OR CRY TO YOU VIOLENCE

 AND YOU WILL NOT SAVE

WHY DO YOU MAKE ME SEE INIQUITY AND WHY DO YOU IDLY LOOK AT WRONG

DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE ARE BEFORE ME; STRIFE AND CONTENTION ARISE

SO THE LAW IS PARALYZED AND JUSTICE NEVER GOES FORTH

FOR THE WICKED SURROUND THE RIGHTEOUS; SO JUSTICE GOES FORTH PERVERTED

LOOK AMONG THE NATIONS AND SEE; WONDER AND BE ASTOUNDED

FOR I AM DOING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE IF TOLD

FOR BEHOLD I AM RAISING UP THE CHALDEANS THAT BITTER AND HASTY NATION WHO MARCH THROUGH THE BREADTH OF THE EARTH TO SEIZE DWELLINGS NOT THEIR OWN

THEY ARE DREADED AND FEARSOME; THEIR JUSTICE AND DIGNITY GO FORTH FROM THEMSELVES

THEIR HORSES ARE SWIFTER THAN LEOPARDS MORE FIERCE THAN THE EVENING WOLVES; THEIR HORSEMEN PRESS PROUDLY ON

THEIR HORSEMEN COME FROM AFAR; THEY FLY LIKE AN EAGLE SWIFT TO DEVOUR

THEY ALL COME FOR VIOLENCE ALL THEIR FACES FORWARD

THEY GATHER CAPTIVES LIKE SAND

AT KINGS THEY SCOFF AND AT RULERS THEY LAUGH

THEY LAUGH AT EVERY FORTRESS FOR THEY PILE UP EARTH AND TAKE IT

THEN THEY SWEEP BY LIKE THE WIND AND GO ON GUILTY MEN WHOSE OWN MIGHT IS THEIR GOD

 ARE YOU NOT FROM EVERLASTING O LORD MY GOD MY HOLY ONE

WE SHALL NOT DIE

O LORD YOU HAVE ORDAINED THEM AS A JUDGMENT AND YOU O ROCK HAVE ESTABLISHED THEM FOR REPROOF

YOU WHO ARE OF PURER EYES THAN TO SEE EVIL AND CANNOT LOOK AT WRONG WHY DO YOU IDLY LOOK AT TRAITORS AND ARE SILENT WHEN THE WICKED SWALLOWS UP THE MAN MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN HE

YOU MAKE MANKIND LIKE THE FISH OF THE SEA LIKE CRAWLING THINGS THAT HAVE NO RULER

HE BRINGS ALL OF THEM UP WITH A HOOK; HE DRAGS THEM OUT WITH HIS NET; HE GATHERS THEM IN HIS DRAGNET; SO HE REJOICES AND IS GLAD

THEREFORE HE SACRIFICES TO HIS NET AND MAKES OFFERINGS TO HIS DRAGNET; FOR BY THEM HE LIVES IN LUXURY AND HIS FOOD IS RICH

IS HE THEN TO KEEP ON EMPTYING HIS NET AND MERCILESSLY KILLING NATIONS FOREVER

I WILL TAKE MY STAND AT MY WATCHPOST AND STATION MYSELF ON THE TOWER AND LOOK OUT TO SEE WHAT HE WILL SAY TO ME AND WHAT I WILL ANSWER CONCERNING MY COMPLAINT

AND THE LORD ANSWERED ME WRITE THE VISION; MAKE IT PLAIN ON TABLETS SO HE MAY RUN WHO READS IT

FOR STILL THE VISION AWAITS ITS APPOINTED TIME; IT HASTENS TO THE ENDIT WILL NOT LIE

IF IT SEEMS SLOW WAIT FOR IT; IT WILL SURELY COME; IT WILL NOT DELAY

BEHOLD HIS SOUL IS PUFFED UP; IT IS NOT UPRIGHT WITHIN HIM BUT THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITH

MOREOVER WINE IS A TRAITOR AN ARROGANT MAN WHO IS NEVER AT REST

HIS GREED IS AS WIDE AS SHEOL; LIKE DEATH HE HAS NEVER ENOUGH

HE GATHERS FOR HIMSELF ALL NATIONS AND COLLECTS AS HIS OWN ALL PEOPLES

 SHALL NOT ALL THESE TAKE UP THEIR TAUNT AGAINST HIM WITH SCOFFING AND RIDDLES FOR HIM AND SAY WOE TO HIM WHO HEAPS UP WHAT IS NOT HIS OWNFOR HOW LONG

AND LOADS HIMSELF WITH PLEDGES

 WILL NOT YOUR DEBTORS SUDDENLY ARISE AND THOSE AWAKE WHO WILL MAKE YOU TREMBLE

THEN YOU WILL BE SPOIL FOR THEM

BECAUSE YOU HAVE PLUNDERED MANY NATIONS ALL THE REMNANT OF THE PEOPLES SHALL PLUNDER YOU FOR THE BLOOD OF MAN AND VIOLENCE TO THE EARTH TO CITIES AND ALL WHO DWELL IN THEM

WOE TO HIM WHO GETS EVIL GAIN FOR HIS HOUSE TO SET HIS NEST ON HIGH TO BE SAFE FROM THE REACH OF HARM

YOU HAVE DEVISED SHAME FOR YOUR HOUSE BY CUTTING OFF MANY PEOPLES; YOU HAVE FORFEITED YOUR LIFE

FOR THE STONE WILL CRY OUT FROM THE WALL AND THE BEAM FROM THE WOODWORK RESPOND

WOE TO HIM WHO BUILDS A TOWN WITH BLOOD AND FOUNDS A CITY ON INIQUITY

BEHOLD IS IT NOT FROM THE LORD OF HOSTS THAT PEOPLES LABOR MERELY FOR FIRE AND NATIONS WEARY THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING

FOR THE EARTH WILL BE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF THE LORD AS THE WATERS COVER THE SEA

WOE TO HIM WHO MAKES HIS NEIGHBORS DRINKYOU POUR OUT YOUR WRATH AND MAKE THEM DRUNK IN ORDER TO GAZE AT THEIR NAKEDNESS

YOU WILL HAVE YOUR FILL OF SHAME INSTEAD OF GLORY

DRINK YOURSELF AND SHOW YOUR UNCIRCUMCISION

THE CUP IN THE LORD'S RIGHT HAND WILL COME AROUND TO YOU AND UTTER SHAME WILL COME UPON YOUR GLORY

THE VIOLENCE DONE TO LEBANON WILL OVERWHELM YOU AS WILL THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEASTS THAT TERRIFIED THEM FOR THE BLOOD OF MAN AND VIOLENCE TO THE EARTH TO CITIES AND ALL WHO DWELL IN THEM

WHAT PROFIT IS AN IDOL WHEN ITS MAKER HAS SHAPED IT A METAL IMAGE A TEACHER OF LIES

FOR ITS MAKER TRUSTS IN HIS OWN CREATION WHEN HE MAKES SPEECHLESS IDOLS

WOE TO HIM WHO SAYS TO A WOODEN THING AWAKE; TO A SILENT STONE ARISE

CAN THIS TEACH

BEHOLD IT IS OVERLAID WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND THERE IS NO BREATH AT ALL IN IT

BUT THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE; LET ALL THE EARTH KEEP SILENCE BEFORE HIM

A PRAYER OF HABAKKUK THE PROPHET ACCORDING TO SHIGIONOTH

O LORD I HAVE HEARD THE REPORT OF YOU AND YOUR WORK O LORD DO I FEAR

IN THE MIDST OF THE YEARS REVIVE IT; IN THE MIDST OF THE YEARS MAKE IT KNOWN; IN WRATH REMEMBER MERCY

GOD CAME FROM TEMAN AND THE HOLY ONE FROM MOUNT PARAN

HIS SPLENDOR COVERED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WAS FULL OF HIS PRAISE

SELAH HIS BRIGHTNESS WAS LIKE THE LIGHT; RAYS FLASHED FROM HIS HAND; AND THERE HE VEILED HIS POWER

BEFORE HIM WENT PESTILENCE AND PLAGUE FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS

HE STOOD AND MEASURED THE EARTH; HE LOOKED AND SHOOK THE NATIONS; THEN THE ETERNAL MOUNTAINS WERE SCATTERED; THE EVERLASTING HILLS SANK LOW

HIS WERE THE EVERLASTING WAYS

I SAW THE TENTS OF CUSHAN IN AFFLICTION; THE CURTAINS OF THE LAND OF MIDIAN DID TREMBLE

WAS YOUR WRATH AGAINST THE RIVERS O LORD

WAS YOUR ANGER AGAINST THE RIVERS OR YOUR INDIGNATION AGAINST THE SEA WHEN YOU RODE ON YOUR HORSES ON YOUR CHARIOT OF SALVATION

YOU STRIPPED THE SHEATH FROM YOUR BOW CALLING FOR MANY ARROWS

SELAH YOU SPLIT THE EARTH WITH RIVERS

THE MOUNTAINS SAW YOU AND WRITHED; THE RAGING WATERS SWEPT ON; THE DEEP GAVE FORTH ITS VOICE; IT LIFTED ITS HANDS ON HIGH

THE SUN AND MOON STOOD STILL IN THEIR PLACE AT THE LIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS AS THEY SPED AT THE FLASH OF YOUR GLITTERING SPEAR

YOU MARCHED THROUGH THE EARTH IN FURY; YOU THRESHED THE NATIONS IN ANGER

YOU WENT OUT FOR THE SALVATION OF YOUR PEOPLE FOR THE SALVATION OF YOUR ANOINTED

YOU CRUSHED THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE OF THE WICKED LAYING HIM BARE FROM THIGH TO NECK

SELAH YOU PIERCED WITH HIS OWN ARROWS THE HEADS OF HIS WARRIORS WHO CAME LIKE A WHIRLWIND TO SCATTER ME REJOICING AS IF TO DEVOUR THE POOR IN SECRET

YOU TRAMPLED THE SEA WITH YOUR HORSES THE SURGING OF MIGHTY WATERS

I HEAR AND MY BODY TREMBLES; MY LIPS QUIVER AT THE SOUND; ROTTENNESS ENTERS INTO MY BONES; MY LEGS TREMBLE BENEATH ME

YET I WILL QUIETLY WAIT FOR THE DAY OF TROUBLE TO COME UPON PEOPLE WHO INVADE US

THOUGH THE FIG TREE SHOULD NOT BLOSSOM NOR FRUIT BE ON THE VINES THE PRODUCE OF THE OLIVE FAIL AND THE FIELDS YIELD NO FOOD THE FLOCK BE CUT OFF FROM THE FOLD AND THERE BE NO HERD IN THE STALLS YET I WILL REJOICE IN THE LORD; I WILL TAKE JOY IN THE GOD OF MY SALVATION

GOD THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH; HE MAKES MY FEET LIKE THE DEER'S; HE MAKES ME TREAD ON MY HIGH PLACES

TO THE CHOIRMASTER WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS

LUKEINASMUCH AS MANY HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO COMPILE A NARRATIVE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AMONG US JUST AS THOSE WHO FROM THE BEGINNING WERE EYEWITNESSES AND MINISTERS OF THE WORD HAVE DELIVERED THEM TO US IT SEEMED GOOD TO ME ALSO HAVING FOLLOWED ALL THINGS CLOSELY FOR SOME TIME PAST TO WRITE AN ORDERLY ACCOUNT FOR YOU MOST EXCELLENT THEOPHILUS THAT YOU MAY HAVE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE THINGS YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT

IN THE DAYS OF HEROD KING OF JUDEA THERE WAS A PRIEST NAMED ZECHARIAH OF THE DIVISION OF ABIJAH

AND HE HAD A WIFE FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF AARON AND HER NAME WAS ELIZABETH

AND THEY WERE BOTH RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD WALKING BLAMELESSLY IN ALL THE COMMANDMENTS AND STATUTES OF THE LORD

BUT THEY HAD NO CHILD BECAUSE ELIZABETH WAS BARREN AND BOTH WERE ADVANCED IN YEARS

NOW WHILE HE WAS SERVING AS PRIEST BEFORE GOD WHEN HIS DIVISION WAS ON DUTY ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE PRIESTHOOD HE WAS CHOSEN BY LOT TO ENTER THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AND BURN INCENSE

AND THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE WERE PRAYING OUTSIDE AT THE HOUR OF INCENSE

AND THERE APPEARED TO HIM AN ANGEL OF THE LORD STANDING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ALTAR OF INCENSE

AND ZECHARIAH WAS TROUBLED WHEN HE SAW HIM AND FEAR FELL UPON HIM

BUT THE ANGEL SAID TO HIM DO NOT BE AFRAID ZECHARIAH FOR YOUR PRAYER HAS BEEN HEARD AND YOUR WIFE ELIZABETH WILL BEAR YOU A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME JOHN

AND YOU WILL HAVE JOY AND GLADNESS AND MANY WILL REJOICE AT HIS BIRTH FOR HE WILL BE GREAT BEFORE THE LORD

AND HE MUST NOT DRINK WINE OR STRONG DRINK AND HE WILL BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT EVEN FROM HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

AND HE WILL TURN MANY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO THE LORD THEIR GOD AND HE WILL GO BEFORE HIM IN THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF ELIJAH TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN AND THE DISOBEDIENT TO THE WISDOM OF THE JUST TO MAKE READY FOR THE LORD A PEOPLE PREPARED

 AND ZECHARIAH SAID TO THE ANGEL HOW SHALL I KNOW THIS

FOR I AM AN OLD MAN AND MY WIFE IS ADVANCED IN YEARS

 AND THE ANGEL ANSWERED HIM I AM GABRIEL WHO STANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND I WAS SENT TO SPEAK TO YOU AND TO BRING YOU THIS GOOD NEWS

AND BEHOLD YOU WILL BE SILENT AND UNABLE TO SPEAK UNTIL THE DAY THAT THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE BECAUSE YOU DID NOT BELIEVE MY WORDS WHICH WILL BE FULFILLED IN THEIR TIME

 AND THE PEOPLE WERE WAITING FOR ZECHARIAH AND THEY WERE WONDERING AT HIS DELAY IN THE TEMPLE

AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK TO THEM AND THEY REALIZED THAT HE HAD SEEN A VISION IN THE TEMPLE

AND HE KEPT MAKING SIGNS TO THEM AND REMAINED MUTE

AND WHEN HIS TIME OF SERVICE WAS ENDED HE WENT TO HIS HOME

AFTER THESE DAYS HIS WIFE ELIZABETH CONCEIVED AND FOR FIVE MONTHS SHE KEPT HERSELF HIDDEN SAYING THUS THE LORD HAS DONE FOR ME IN THE DAYS WHEN HE LOOKED ON ME TO TAKE AWAY MY REPROACH AMONG PEOPLE

 IN THE SIXTH MONTH THE ANGEL GABRIEL WAS SENT FROM GOD TO A CITY OF GALILEE NAMED NAZARETH TO A VIRGIN BETROTHED TO A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS JOSEPH OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID

AND THE VIRGIN'S NAME WAS MARY

AND HE CAME TO HER AND SAID GREETINGS O FAVORED ONE THE LORD IS WITH YOU

 BUT SHE WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE SAYING AND TRIED TO DISCERN WHAT SORT OF GREETING THIS MIGHT BE

AND THE ANGEL SAID TO HER DO NOT BE AFRAID MARY FOR YOU HAVE FOUND FAVOR WITH GOD

AND BEHOLD YOU WILL CONCEIVE IN YOUR WOMB AND BEAR A SON AND YOU SHALL CALL HIS NAME JESUS

HE WILL BE GREAT AND WILL BE CALLED THE SON OF THE MOST HIGH

AND THE LORD GOD WILL GIVE TO HIM THE THRONE OF HIS FATHER DAVID AND HE WILL REIGN OVER THE HOUSE OF JACOB FOREVER AND OF HIS KINGDOM THERE WILL BE NO END

 AND MARY SAID TO THE ANGEL HOW WILL THIS BE SINCE I AM A VIRGIN

 AND THE ANGEL ANSWERED HER THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL COME UPON YOU AND THE POWER OF THE MOST HIGH WILL OVERSHADOW YOU; THEREFORE THE CHILD TO BE BORN WILL BE CALLED HOLYTHE SON OF GOD

AND BEHOLD YOUR RELATIVE ELIZABETH IN HER OLD AGE HAS ALSO CONCEIVED A SON AND THIS IS THE SIXTH MONTH WITH HER WHO WAS CALLED BARREN

FOR NOTHING WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD

 AND MARY SAID BEHOLD I AM THE SERVANT OF THE LORD; LET IT BE TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD

 AND THE ANGEL DEPARTED FROM HER

IN THOSE DAYS MARY AROSE AND WENT WITH HASTE INTO THE HILL COUNTRY TO A TOWN IN JUDAH AND SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF ZECHARIAH AND GREETED ELIZABETH

AND WHEN ELIZABETH HEARD THE GREETING OF MARY THE BABY LEAPED IN HER WOMB

AND ELIZABETH WAS FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A LOUD CRY BLESSED ARE YOU AMONG WOMEN AND BLESSED IS THE FRUIT OF YOUR WOMB

AND WHY IS THIS GRANTED TO ME THAT THE MOTHER OF MY LORD SHOULD COME TO ME

FOR BEHOLD WHEN THE SOUND OF YOUR GREETING CAME TO MY EARS THE BABY IN MY WOMB LEAPED FOR JOY

AND BLESSED IS SHE WHO BELIEVED THAT THERE WOULD BE A FULFILLMENT OF WHAT WAS SPOKEN TO HER FROM THE LORD

 AND MARY SAID MY SOUL MAGNIFIES THE LORD AND MY SPIRIT REJOICES IN GOD MY SAVIOR FOR HE HAS LOOKED ON THE HUMBLE ESTATE OF HIS SERVANT

FOR BEHOLD FROM NOW ON ALL GENERATIONS WILL CALL ME BLESSED; FOR HE WHO IS MIGHTY HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR ME AND HOLY IS HIS NAME

AND HIS MERCY IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION

HE HAS SHOWN STRENGTH WITH HIS ARM; HE HAS SCATTERED THE PROUD IN THE THOUGHTS OF THEIR HEARTS; HE HAS BROUGHT DOWN THE MIGHTY FROM THEIR THRONES AND EXALTED THOSE OF HUMBLE ESTATE; HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS AND THE RICH HE HAS SENT EMPTY AWAY

HE HAS HELPED HIS SERVANT ISRAEL IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS MERCY AS HE SPOKE TO OUR FATHERS TO ABRAHAM AND TO HIS OFFSPRING FOREVER

 AND MARY REMAINED WITH HER ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND RETURNED TO HER HOME

NOW THE TIME CAME FOR ELIZABETH TO GIVE BIRTH AND SHE BORE A SON

AND HER NEIGHBORS AND RELATIVES HEARD THAT THE LORD HAD SHOWN GREAT MERCY TO HER AND THEY REJOICED WITH HER

AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THEY CAME TO CIRCUMCISE THE CHILD

AND THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM ZECHARIAH AFTER HIS FATHER BUT HIS MOTHER ANSWERED NO; HE SHALL BE CALLED JOHN

 AND THEY SAID TO HER NONE OF YOUR RELATIVES IS CALLED BY THIS NAME

 AND THEY MADE SIGNS TO HIS FATHER INQUIRING WHAT HE WANTED HIM TO BE CALLED

AND HE ASKED FOR A WRITING TABLET AND WROTE HIS NAME IS JOHN

 AND THEY ALL WONDERED

AND IMMEDIATELY HIS MOUTH WAS OPENED AND HIS TONGUE LOOSED AND HE SPOKE BLESSING GOD

AND FEAR CAME ON ALL THEIR NEIGHBORS

AND ALL THESE THINGS WERE TALKED ABOUT THROUGH ALL THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUDEA AND ALL WHO HEARD THEM LAID THEM UP IN THEIR HEARTS SAYING WHAT THEN WILL THIS CHILD BE

 FOR THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS WITH HIM

AND HIS FATHER ZECHARIAH WAS FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND PROPHESIED SAYING BLESSED BE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL FOR HE HAS VISITED AND REDEEMED HIS PEOPLE AND HAS RAISED UP A HORN OF SALVATION FOR US IN THE HOUSE OF HIS SERVANT DAVID AS HE SPOKE BY THE MOUTH OF HIS HOLY PROPHETS FROM OF OLD THAT WE SHOULD BE SAVED FROM OUR ENEMIES AND FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US; TO SHOW THE MERCY PROMISED TO OUR FATHERS AND TO REMEMBER HIS HOLY COVENANT THE OATH THAT HE SWORE TO OUR FATHER ABRAHAM TO GRANT US THAT WE BEING DELIVERED FROM THE HAND OF OUR ENEMIES MIGHT SERVE HIM WITHOUT FEAR IN HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS BEFORE HIM ALL OUR DAYS

AND YOU CHILD WILL BE CALLED THE PROPHET OF THE MOST HIGH; FOR YOU WILL GO BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS TO GIVE KNOWLEDGE OF SALVATION TO HIS PEOPLE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF THEIR SINS BECAUSE OF THE TENDER MERCY OF OUR GOD WHEREBY THE SUNRISE SHALL VISIT US FROM ON HIGH TO GIVE LIGHT TO THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH TO GUIDE OUR FEET INTO THE WAY OF PEACE

 AND THE CHILD GREW AND BECAME STRONG IN SPIRIT AND HE WAS IN THE WILDERNESS UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCE TO ISRAEL

IN THOSE DAYS A DECREE WENT OUT FROM CAESAR AUGUSTUS THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD BE REGISTERED

THIS WAS THE FIRST REGISTRATION WHEN QUIRINIUS WAS GOVERNOR OF SYRIA

AND ALL WENT TO BE REGISTERED EACH TO HIS OWN TOWN

AND JOSEPH ALSO WENT UP FROM GALILEE FROM THE TOWN OF NAZARETH TO JUDEA TO THE CITY OF DAVID WHICH IS CALLED BETHLEHEM BECAUSE HE WAS OF THE HOUSE AND LINEAGE OF DAVID TO BE REGISTERED WITH MARY HIS BETROTHED WHO WAS WITH CHILD

AND WHILE THEY WERE THERE THE TIME CAME FOR HER TO GIVE BIRTH

AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO HER FIRSTBORN SON AND WRAPPED HIM IN SWADDLING CLOTHS AND LAID HIM IN A MANGER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THEM IN THE INN

AND IN THE SAME REGION THERE WERE SHEPHERDS OUT IN THE FIELD KEEPING WATCH OVER THEIR FLOCK BY NIGHT

AND AN ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO THEM AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHONE AROUND THEM AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH FEAR

AND THE ANGEL SAID TO THEM FEAR NOT FOR BEHOLD I BRING YOU GOOD NEWS OF A GREAT JOY THAT WILL BE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE

FOR UNTO YOU IS BORN THIS DAY IN THE CITY OF DAVID A SAVIOR WHO IS CHRIST THE LORD

AND THIS WILL BE A SIGN FOR YOU YOU WILL FIND A BABY WRAPPED IN SWADDLING CLOTHS AND LYING IN A MANGER

 AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS WITH THE ANGEL A MULTITUDE OF THE HEAVENLY HOST PRAISING GOD AND SAYING GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE AMONG THOSE WITH WHOM HE IS PLEASED

 WHEN THE ANGELS WENT AWAY FROM THEM INTO HEAVEN THE SHEPHERDS SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET US GO OVER TO BETHLEHEM AND SEE THIS THING THAT HAS HAPPENED WHICH THE LORD HAS MADE KNOWN TO US

 AND THEY WENT WITH HASTE AND FOUND MARY AND JOSEPH AND THE BABY LYING IN A MANGER

AND WHEN THEY SAW IT THEY MADE KNOWN THE SAYING THAT HAD BEEN TOLD THEM CONCERNING THIS CHILD

AND ALL WHO HEARD IT WONDERED AT WHAT THE SHEPHERDS TOLD THEM

BUT MARY TREASURED UP ALL THESE THINGS PONDERING THEM IN HER HEART

AND THE SHEPHERDS RETURNED GLORIFYING AND PRAISING GOD FOR ALL THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN AS IT HAD BEEN TOLD THEM

AND AT THE END OF EIGHT DAYS WHEN HE WAS CIRCUMCISED HE WAS CALLED JESUS THE NAME GIVEN BY THE ANGEL BEFORE HE WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WOMB

AND WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THEIR PURIFICATION ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THEY BROUGHT HIM UP TO JERUSALEM TO PRESENT HIM TO THE LORD AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF THE LORD EVERY MALE WHO FIRST OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD AND TO OFFER A SACRIFICE ACCORDING TO WHAT IS SAID IN THE LAW OF THE LORD A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS

 NOW THERE WAS A MAN IN JERUSALEM WHOSE NAME WAS SIMEON AND THIS MAN WAS RIGHTEOUS AND DEVOUT WAITING FOR THE CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL AND THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS UPON HIM

AND IT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM BY THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE DEATH BEFORE HE HAD SEEN THE LORD'S CHRIST

AND HE CAME IN THE SPIRIT INTO THE TEMPLE AND WHEN THE PARENTS BROUGHT IN THE CHILD JESUS TO DO FOR HIM ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE LAW HE TOOK HIM UP IN HIS ARMS AND BLESSED GOD AND SAID LORD NOW YOU ARE LETTING YOUR SERVANT DEPART IN PEACE ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD; FOR MY EYES HAVE SEEN YOUR SALVATION THAT YOU HAVE PREPARED IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL PEOPLES A LIGHT FOR REVELATION TO THE GENTILES AND FOR GLORY TO YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL

 AND HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER MARVELED AT WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT HIM

AND SIMEON BLESSED THEM AND SAID TO MARY HIS MOTHER BEHOLD THIS CHILD IS APPOINTED FOR THE FALL AND RISING OF MANY IN ISRAEL AND FOR A SIGN THAT IS OPPOSED AND A SWORD WILL PIERCE THROUGH YOUR OWN SOUL ALSO SO THAT THOUGHTS FROM MANY HEARTS MAY BE REVEALED

 AND THERE WAS A PROPHETESS ANNA THE DAUGHTER OF PHANUEL OF THE TRIBE OF ASHER

SHE WAS ADVANCED IN YEARS HAVING LIVED WITH HER HUSBAND SEVEN YEARS FROM WHEN SHE WAS A VIRGIN AND THEN AS A WIDOW UNTIL SHE WAS EIGHTYFOUR

SHE DID NOT DEPART FROM THE TEMPLE WORSHIPING WITH FASTING AND PRAYER NIGHT AND DAY

AND COMING UP AT THAT VERY HOUR SHE BEGAN TO GIVE THANKS TO GOD AND TO SPEAK OF HIM TO ALL WHO WERE WAITING FOR THE REDEMPTION OF JERUSALEM

AND WHEN THEY HAD PERFORMED EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE LORD THEY RETURNED INTO GALILEE TO THEIR OWN TOWN OF NAZARETH

AND THE CHILD GREW AND BECAME STRONG FILLED WITH WISDOM

AND THE FAVOR OF GOD WAS UPON HIM

NOW HIS PARENTS WENT TO JERUSALEM EVERY YEAR AT THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER

AND WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD THEY WENT UP ACCORDING TO CUSTOM

AND WHEN THE FEAST WAS ENDED AS THEY WERE RETURNING THE BOY JESUS STAYED BEHIND IN JERUSALEM

HIS PARENTS DID NOT KNOW IT BUT SUPPOSING HIM TO BE IN THE GROUP THEY WENT A DAY'S JOURNEY BUT THEN THEY BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR HIM AMONG THEIR RELATIVES AND ACQUAINTANCES AND WHEN THEY DID NOT FIND HIM THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM SEARCHING FOR HIM

AFTER THREE DAYS THEY FOUND HIM IN THE TEMPLE SITTING AMONG THE TEACHERS LISTENING TO THEM AND ASKING THEM QUESTIONS

AND ALL WHO HEARD HIM WERE AMAZED AT HIS UNDERSTANDING AND HIS ANSWERS

AND WHEN HIS PARENTS SAW HIM THEY WERE ASTONISHED

AND HIS MOTHER SAID TO HIM SON WHY HAVE YOU TREATED US SO

BEHOLD YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOU IN GREAT DISTRESS

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME

DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT I MUST BE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE

 AND THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SAYING THAT HE SPOKE TO THEM

AND HE WENT DOWN WITH THEM AND CAME TO NAZARETH AND WAS SUBMISSIVE TO THEM

AND HIS MOTHER TREASURED UP ALL THESE THINGS IN HER HEART

AND JESUS INCREASED IN WISDOM AND IN STATURE AND IN FAVOR WITH GOD AND MAN

IN THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS CAESAR PONTIUS PILATE BEING GOVERNOR OF JUDEA AND HEROD BEING TETRARCH OF GALILEE AND HIS BROTHER PHILIP TETRARCH OF THE REGION OF ITURAEA AND TRACHONITIS AND LYSANIAS TETRARCH OF ABILENE DURING THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF ANNAS AND CAIAPHAS THE WORD OF GOD CAME TO JOHN THE SON OF ZECHARIAH IN THE WILDERNESS

AND HE WENT INTO ALL THE REGION AROUND THE JORDAN PROCLAIMING A BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE WORDS OF ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS 'PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT

EVERY VALLEY SHALL BE FILLED AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL SHALL BE MADE LOW AND THE CROOKED SHALL BECOME STRAIGHT AND THE ROUGH PLACES SHALL BECOME LEVEL WAYS AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD

' HE SAID THEREFORE TO THE CROWDS THAT CAME OUT TO BE BAPTIZED BY HIM YOU BROOD OF VIPERS

WHO WARNED YOU TO FLEE FROM THE WRATH TO COME

BEAR FRUITS IN KEEPING WITH REPENTANCE

AND DO NOT BEGIN TO SAY TO YOURSELVES 'WE HAVE ABRAHAM AS OUR FATHER

' FOR I TELL YOU GOD IS ABLE FROM THESE STONES TO RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR ABRAHAM

EVEN NOW THE AXE IS LAID TO THE ROOT OF THE TREES

EVERY TREE THEREFORE THAT DOES NOT BEAR GOOD FRUIT IS CUT DOWN AND THROWN INTO THE FIRE

 AND THE CROWDS ASKED HIM WHAT THEN SHALL WE DO

 AND HE ANSWERED THEM WHOEVER HAS TWO TUNICS IS TO SHARE WITH HIM WHO HAS NONE AND WHOEVER HAS FOOD IS TO DO LIKEWISE

 TAX COLLECTORS ALSO CAME TO BE BAPTIZED AND SAID TO HIM TEACHER WHAT SHALL WE DO

 AND HE SAID TO THEM COLLECT NO MORE THAN YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO DO

 SOLDIERS ALSO ASKED HIM AND WE WHAT SHALL WE DO

 AND HE SAID TO THEM DO NOT EXTORT MONEY FROM ANYONE BY THREATS OR BY FALSE ACCUSATION AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR WAGES

 AS THE PEOPLE WERE IN EXPECTATION AND ALL WERE QUESTIONING IN THEIR HEARTS CONCERNING JOHN WHETHER HE MIGHT BE THE CHRIST JOHN ANSWERED THEM ALL SAYING I BAPTIZE YOU WITH WATER BUT HE WHO IS MIGHTIER THAN I IS COMING THE STRAP OF WHOSE SANDALS I AM NOT WORTHY TO UNTIE

HE WILL BAPTIZE YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND WITH FIRE

HIS WINNOWING FORK IS IN HIS HAND TO CLEAR HIS THRESHING FLOOR AND TO GATHER THE WHEAT INTO HIS BARN BUT THE CHAFF HE WILL BURN WITH UNQUENCHABLE FIRE

 SO WITH MANY OTHER EXHORTATIONS HE PREACHED GOOD NEWS TO THE PEOPLE

BUT HEROD THE TETRARCH WHO HAD BEEN REPROVED BY HIM FOR HERODIAS HIS BROTHER'S WIFE AND FOR ALL THE EVIL THINGS THAT HEROD HAD DONE ADDED THIS TO THEM ALL THAT HE LOCKED UP JOHN IN PRISON

NOW WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE WERE BAPTIZED AND WHEN JESUS ALSO HAD BEEN BAPTIZED AND WAS PRAYING THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED AND THE HOLY SPIRIT DESCENDED ON HIM IN BODILY FORM LIKE A DOVE; AND A VOICE CAME FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE MY BELOVED SON; WITH YOU I AM WELL PLEASED

 JESUS WHEN HE BEGAN HIS MINISTRY WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE BEING THE SON AS WAS SUPPOSED OF JOSEPH THE SON OF HELI THE SON OF MATTHAT THE SON OF LEVI THE SON OF MELCHI THE SON OF JANNAI THE SON OF JOSEPH THE SON OF MATTATHIAS THE SON OF AMOS THE SON OF NAHUM THE SON OF ESLI THE SON OF NAGGAI THE SON OF MAATH THE SON OF MATTATHIAS THE SON OF SEMEIN THE SON OF JOSECH THE SON OF JODA THE SON OF JOANAN THE SON OF RHESA THE SON OF ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL THE SON OF NERI THE SON OF MELCHI THE SON OF ADDI THE SON OF COSAM THE SON OF ELMADAM THE SON OF ER THE SON OF JOSHUA THE SON OF ELIEZER THE SON OF JORIM THE SON OF MATTHAT THE SON OF LEVI THE SON OF SIMEON THE SON OF JUDAH THE SON OF JOSEPH THE SON OF JONAM THE SON OF ELIAKIM THE SON OF MELEA THE SON OF MENNA THE SON OF MATTATHA THE SON OF NATHAN THE SON OF DAVID THE SON OF JESSE THE SON OF OBED THE SON OF BOAZ THE SON OF SALA THE SON OF NAHSHON THE SON OF AMMINADAB THE SON OF ADMIN THE SON OF ARNI THE SON OF HEZRON THE SON OF PEREZ THE SON OF JUDAH THE SON OF JACOB THE SON OF ISAAC THE SON OF ABRAHAM THE SON OF TERAH THE SON OF NAHOR THE SON OF SERUG THE SON OF REU THE SON OF PELEG THE SON OF EBER THE SON OF SHELAH THE SON OF CAINAN THE SON OF ARPHAXAD THE SON OF SHEM THE SON OF NOAH THE SON OF LAMECH THE SON OF METHUSELAH THE SON OF ENOCH THE SON OF JARED THE SON OF MAHALALEEL THE SON OF CAINAN THE SON OF ENOS THE SON OF SETH THE SON OF ADAM THE SON OF GOD

AND JESUS FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT RETURNED FROM THE JORDAN AND WAS LED BY THE SPIRIT IN THE WILDERNESS FOR FORTY DAYS BEING TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL

AND HE ATE NOTHING DURING THOSE DAYS

AND WHEN THEY WERE ENDED HE WAS HUNGRY

THE DEVIL SAID TO HIM IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD COMMAND THIS STONE TO BECOME BREAD

 AND JESUS ANSWERED HIM IT IS WRITTEN 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE

' AND THE DEVIL TOOK HIM UP AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD IN A MOMENT OF TIME AND SAID TO HIM TO YOU I WILL GIVE ALL THIS AUTHORITY AND THEIR GLORY FOR IT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO ME AND I GIVE IT TO WHOM I WILL

IF YOU THEN WILL WORSHIP ME IT WILL ALL BE YOURS

 AND JESUS ANSWERED HIM IT IS WRITTEN 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIM ONLY SHALL YOU SERVE

' AND HE TOOK HIM TO JERUSALEM AND SET HIM ON THE PINNACLE OF THE TEMPLE AND SAID TO HIM IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD THROW YOURSELF DOWN FROM HERE FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU' AND 'ON THEIR HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE

' AND JESUS ANSWERED HIM IT IS SAID 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST

' AND WHEN THE DEVIL HAD ENDED EVERY TEMPTATION HE DEPARTED FROM HIM UNTIL AN OPPORTUNE TIME

AND JESUS RETURNED IN THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT TO GALILEE AND A REPORT ABOUT HIM WENT OUT THROUGH ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY

AND HE TAUGHT IN THEIR SYNAGOGUES BEING GLORIFIED BY ALL

AND HE CAME TO NAZARETH WHERE HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP

AND AS WAS HIS CUSTOM HE WENT TO THE SYNAGOGUE ON THE SABBATH DAY AND HE STOOD UP TO READ

AND THE SCROLL OF THE PROPHET ISAIAH WAS GIVEN TO HIM

HE UNROLLED THE SCROLL AND FOUND THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HAS ANOINTED ME TO PROCLAIM GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR

HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES AND RECOVERING OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND TO SET AT LIBERTY THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED TO PROCLAIM THE YEAR OF THE LORD'S FAVOR

 AND HE ROLLED UP THE SCROLL AND GAVE IT BACK TO THE ATTENDANT AND SAT DOWN

AND THE EYES OF ALL IN THE SYNAGOGUE WERE FIXED ON HIM

AND HE BEGAN TO SAY TO THEM TODAY THIS SCRIPTURE HAS BEEN FULFILLED IN YOUR HEARING

 AND ALL SPOKE WELL OF HIM AND MARVELED AT THE GRACIOUS WORDS THAT WERE COMING FROM HIS MOUTH

AND THEY SAID IS NOT THIS JOSEPH'S SON

 AND HE SAID TO THEM DOUBTLESS YOU WILL QUOTE TO ME THIS PROVERB 'PHYSICIAN HEAL YOURSELF

' WHAT WE HAVE HEARD YOU DID AT CAPERNAUM DO HERE IN YOUR HOMETOWN AS WELL

 AND HE SAID TRULY I SAY TO YOU NO PROPHET IS ACCEPTABLE IN HIS HOMETOWN

BUT IN TRUTH I TELL YOU THERE WERE MANY WIDOWS IN ISRAEL IN THE DAYS OF ELIJAH WHEN THE HEAVENS WERE SHUT UP THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AND A GREAT FAMINE CAME OVER ALL THE LAND AND ELIJAH WAS SENT TO NONE OF THEM BUT ONLY TO ZAREPHATH IN THE LAND OF SIDON TO A WOMAN WHO WAS A WIDOW

AND THERE WERE MANY LEPERS IN ISRAEL IN THE TIME OF THE PROPHET ELISHA AND NONE OF THEM WAS CLEANSED BUT ONLY NAAMAN THE SYRIAN

 WHEN THEY HEARD THESE THINGS ALL IN THE SYNAGOGUE WERE FILLED WITH WRATH

AND THEY ROSE UP AND DROVE HIM OUT OF THE TOWN AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE BROW OF THE HILL ON WHICH THEIR TOWN WAS BUILT SO THAT THEY COULD THROW HIM DOWN THE CLIFF

BUT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MIDST HE WENT AWAY

AND HE WENT DOWN TO CAPERNAUM A CITY OF GALILEE

AND HE WAS TEACHING THEM ON THE SABBATH AND THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT HIS TEACHING FOR HIS WORD POSSESSED AUTHORITY

AND IN THE SYNAGOGUE THERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD THE SPIRIT OF AN UNCLEAN DEMON AND HE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE HA

WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH US JESUS OF NAZARETH

HAVE YOU COME TO DESTROY US

I KNOW WHO YOU ARETHE HOLY ONE OF GOD

 BUT JESUS REBUKED HIM SAYING BE SILENT AND COME OUT OF HIM

 AND WHEN THE DEMON HAD THROWN HIM DOWN IN THEIR MIDST HE CAME OUT OF HIM HAVING DONE HIM NO HARM

AND THEY WERE ALL AMAZED AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS THIS WORD

FOR WITH AUTHORITY AND POWER HE COMMANDS THE UNCLEAN SPIRITS AND THEY COME OUT

 AND REPORTS ABOUT HIM WENT OUT INTO EVERY PLACE IN THE SURROUNDING REGION

AND HE AROSE AND LEFT THE SYNAGOGUE AND ENTERED SIMON'S HOUSE

NOW SIMON'S MOTHERINLAW WAS ILL WITH A HIGH FEVER AND THEY APPEALED TO HIM ON HER BEHALF

AND HE STOOD OVER HER AND REBUKED THE FEVER AND IT LEFT HER AND IMMEDIATELY SHE ROSE AND BEGAN TO SERVE THEM

NOW WHEN THE SUN WAS SETTING ALL THOSE WHO HAD ANY WHO WERE SICK WITH VARIOUS DISEASES BROUGHT THEM TO HIM AND HE LAID HIS HANDS ON EVERY ONE OF THEM AND HEALED THEM

AND DEMONS ALSO CAME OUT OF MANY CRYING YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD

 BUT HE REBUKED THEM AND WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT HE WAS THE CHRIST

AND WHEN IT WAS DAY HE DEPARTED AND WENT INTO A DESOLATE PLACE

AND THE PEOPLE SOUGHT HIM AND CAME TO HIM AND WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM FROM LEAVING THEM BUT HE SAID TO THEM I MUST PREACH THE GOOD NEWS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD TO THE OTHER TOWNS AS WELL; FOR I WAS SENT FOR THIS PURPOSE

 AND HE WAS PREACHING IN THE SYNAGOGUES OF JUDEA

ON ONE OCCASION WHILE THE CROWD WAS PRESSING IN ON HIM TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD HE WAS STANDING BY THE LAKE OF GENNESARET AND HE SAW TWO BOATS BY THE LAKE BUT THE FISHERMEN HAD GONE OUT OF THEM AND WERE WASHING THEIR NETS

GETTING INTO ONE OF THE BOATS WHICH WAS SIMON'S HE ASKED HIM TO PUT OUT A LITTLE FROM THE LAND

AND HE SAT DOWN AND TAUGHT THE PEOPLE FROM THE BOAT

AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING HE SAID TO SIMON PUT OUT INTO THE DEEP AND LET DOWN YOUR NETS FOR A CATCH

 AND SIMON ANSWERED MASTER WE TOILED ALL NIGHT AND TOOK NOTHING

BUT AT YOUR WORD I WILL LET DOWN THE NETS

 AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY ENCLOSED A LARGE NUMBER OF FISH AND THEIR NETS WERE BREAKING

THEY SIGNALED TO THEIR PARTNERS IN THE OTHER BOAT TO COME AND HELP THEM

AND THEY CAME AND FILLED BOTH THE BOATS SO THAT THEY BEGAN TO SINK

BUT WHEN SIMON PETER SAW IT HE FELL DOWN AT JESUS' KNEES SAYING DEPART FROM ME FOR I AM A SINFUL MAN O LORD

 FOR HE AND ALL WHO WERE WITH HIM WERE ASTONISHED AT THE CATCH OF FISH THAT THEY HAD TAKEN AND SO ALSO WERE JAMES AND JOHN SONS OF ZEBEDEE WHO WERE PARTNERS WITH SIMON

AND JESUS SAID TO SIMON DO NOT BE AFRAID; FROM NOW ON YOU WILL BE CATCHING MEN

 AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEIR BOATS TO LAND THEY LEFT EVERYTHING AND FOLLOWED HIM

WHILE HE WAS IN ONE OF THE CITIES THERE CAME A MAN FULL OF LEPROSY

AND WHEN HE SAW JESUS HE FELL ON HIS FACE AND BEGGED HIM LORD IF YOU WILL YOU CAN MAKE ME CLEAN

 AND JESUS STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED HIM SAYING I WILL; BE CLEAN

 AND IMMEDIATELY THE LEPROSY LEFT HIM

AND HE CHARGED HIM TO TELL NO ONE BUT GO AND SHOW YOURSELF TO THE PRIEST AND MAKE AN OFFERING FOR YOUR CLEANSING AS MOSES COMMANDED FOR A PROOF TO THEM

 BUT NOW EVEN MORE THE REPORT ABOUT HIM WENT ABROAD AND GREAT CROWDS GATHERED TO HEAR HIM AND TO BE HEALED OF THEIR INFIRMITIES

BUT HE WOULD WITHDRAW TO DESOLATE PLACES AND PRAY

ON ONE OF THOSE DAYS AS HE WAS TEACHING PHARISEES AND TEACHERS OF THE LAW WERE SITTING THERE WHO HAD COME FROM EVERY VILLAGE OF GALILEE AND JUDEA AND FROM JERUSALEM

AND THE POWER OF THE LORD WAS WITH HIM TO HEAL

AND BEHOLD SOME MEN WERE BRINGING ON A BED A MAN WHO WAS PARALYZED AND THEY WERE SEEKING TO BRING HIM IN AND LAY HIM BEFORE JESUS BUT FINDING NO WAY TO BRING HIM IN BECAUSE OF THE CROWD THEY WENT UP ON THE ROOF AND LET HIM DOWN WITH HIS BED THROUGH THE TILES INTO THE MIDST BEFORE JESUS

AND WHEN HE SAW THEIR FAITH HE SAID MAN YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN YOU

 AND THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES BEGAN TO QUESTION SAYING WHO IS THIS WHO SPEAKS BLASPHEMIES

WHO CAN FORGIVE SINS BUT GOD ALONE

 WHEN JESUS PERCEIVED THEIR THOUGHTS HE ANSWERED THEM WHY DO YOU QUESTION IN YOUR HEARTS

WHICH IS EASIER TO SAY 'YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN YOU' OR TO SAY 'RISE AND WALK'

BUT THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS AUTHORITY ON EARTH TO FORGIVE SINSHE SAID TO THE MAN WHO WAS PARALYZEDI SAY TO YOU RISE PICK UP YOUR BED AND GO HOME

 AND IMMEDIATELY HE ROSE UP BEFORE THEM AND PICKED UP WHAT HE HAD BEEN LYING ON AND WENT HOME GLORIFYING GOD

AND AMAZEMENT SEIZED THEM ALL AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD AND WERE FILLED WITH AWE SAYING WE HAVE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY THINGS TODAY

 AFTER THIS HE WENT OUT AND SAW A TAX COLLECTOR NAMED LEVI SITTING AT THE TAX BOOTH

AND HE SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME

 AND LEAVING EVERYTHING HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM

AND LEVI MADE HIM A GREAT FEAST IN HIS HOUSE AND THERE WAS A LARGE COMPANY OF TAX COLLECTORS AND OTHERS RECLINING AT TABLE WITH THEM

AND THE PHARISEES AND THEIR SCRIBES GRUMBLED AT HIS DISCIPLES SAYING WHY DO YOU EAT AND DRINK WITH TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM THOSE WHO ARE WELL HAVE NO NEED OF A PHYSICIAN BUT THOSE WHO ARE SICK

I HAVE NOT COME TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS BUT SINNERS TO REPENTANCE

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM THE DISCIPLES OF JOHN FAST OFTEN AND OFFER PRAYERS AND SO DO THE DISCIPLES OF THE PHARISEES BUT YOURS EAT AND DRINK

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM CAN YOU MAKE WEDDING GUESTS FAST WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM IS WITH THEM

THE DAYS WILL COME WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND THEN THEY WILL FAST IN THOSE DAYS

 HE ALSO TOLD THEM A PARABLE NO ONE TEARS A PIECE FROM A NEW GARMENT AND PUTS IT ON AN OLD GARMENT

IF HE DOES HE WILL TEAR THE NEW AND THE PIECE FROM THE NEW WILL NOT MATCH THE OLD

AND NO ONE PUTS NEW WINE INTO OLD WINESKINS

IF HE DOES THE NEW WINE WILL BURST THE SKINS AND IT WILL BE SPILLED AND THE SKINS WILL BE DESTROYED

BUT NEW WINE MUST BE PUT INTO FRESH WINESKINS

AND NO ONE AFTER DRINKING OLD WINE DESIRES NEW FOR HE SAYS 'THE OLD IS GOOD

'ON A SABBATH WHILE HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE GRAINFIELDS HIS DISCIPLES PLUCKED AND ATE SOME HEADS OF GRAIN RUBBING THEM IN THEIR HANDS

BUT SOME OF THE PHARISEES SAID WHY ARE YOU DOING WHAT IS NOT LAWFUL TO DO ON THE SABBATH

 AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM HAVE YOU NOT READ WHAT DAVID DID WHEN HE WAS HUNGRY HE AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM HOW HE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF GOD AND TOOK AND ATE THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE WHICH IS NOT LAWFUL FOR ANY BUT THE PRIESTS TO EAT AND ALSO GAVE IT TO THOSE WITH HIM

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THE SON OF MAN IS LORD OF THE SABBATH

 ON ANOTHER SABBATH HE ENTERED THE SYNAGOGUE AND WAS TEACHING AND A MAN WAS THERE WHOSE RIGHT HAND WAS WITHERED

AND THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES WATCHED HIM TO SEE WHETHER HE WOULD HEAL ON THE SABBATH SO THAT THEY MIGHT FIND A REASON TO ACCUSE HIM

BUT HE KNEW THEIR THOUGHTS AND HE SAID TO THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND COME AND STAND HERE

 AND HE ROSE AND STOOD THERE

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM I ASK YOU IS IT LAWFUL ON THE SABBATH TO DO GOOD OR TO DO HARM TO SAVE LIFE OR TO DESTROY IT

 AND AFTER LOOKING AROUND AT THEM ALL HE SAID TO HIM STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND

 AND HE DID SO AND HIS HAND WAS RESTORED

BUT THEY WERE FILLED WITH FURY AND DISCUSSED WITH ONE ANOTHER WHAT THEY MIGHT DO TO JESUS

IN THESE DAYS HE WENT OUT TO THE MOUNTAIN TO PRAY AND ALL NIGHT HE CONTINUED IN PRAYER TO GOD

AND WHEN DAY CAME HE CALLED HIS DISCIPLES AND CHOSE FROM THEM TWELVE WHOM HE NAMED APOSTLES SIMON WHOM HE NAMED PETER AND ANDREW HIS BROTHER AND JAMES AND JOHN AND PHILIP AND BARTHOLOMEW AND MATTHEW AND THOMAS AND JAMES THE SON OF ALPHAEUS AND SIMON WHO WAS CALLED THE ZEALOT AND JUDAS THE SON OF JAMES AND JUDAS ISCARIOT WHO BECAME A TRAITOR

AND HE CAME DOWN WITH THEM AND STOOD ON A LEVEL PLACE WITH A GREAT CROWD OF HIS DISCIPLES AND A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE FROM ALL JUDEA AND JERUSALEM AND THE SEACOAST OF TYRE AND SIDON WHO CAME TO HEAR HIM AND TO BE HEALED OF THEIR DISEASES

AND THOSE WHO WERE TROUBLED WITH UNCLEAN SPIRITS WERE CURED

AND ALL THE CROWD SOUGHT TO TOUCH HIM FOR POWER CAME OUT FROM HIM AND HEALED THEM ALL

AND HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES ON HIS DISCIPLES AND SAIDBLESSED ARE YOU WHO ARE POOR FOR YOURS IS THE KINGDOM OF GOD

BLESSED ARE YOU WHO ARE HUNGRY NOW FOR YOU SHALL BE SATISFIED

BLESSED ARE YOU WHO WEEP NOW FOR YOU SHALL LAUGH

BLESSED ARE YOU WHEN PEOPLE HATE YOU AND WHEN THEY EXCLUDE YOU AND REVILE YOU AND SPURN YOUR NAME AS EVIL ON ACCOUNT OF THE SON OF MAN

REJOICE IN THAT DAY AND LEAP FOR JOY FOR BEHOLD YOUR REWARD IS GREAT IN HEAVEN; FOR SO THEIR FATHERS DID TO THE PROPHETS

BUT WOE TO YOU WHO ARE RICH FOR YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR CONSOLATION

WOE TO YOU WHO ARE FULL NOW FOR YOU SHALL BE HUNGRY

WOE TO YOU WHO LAUGH NOW FOR YOU SHALL MOURN AND WEEP

WOE TO YOU WHEN ALL PEOPLE SPEAK WELL OF YOU FOR SO THEIR FATHERS DID TO THE FALSE PROPHETS

BUT I SAY TO YOU WHO HEAR LOVE YOUR ENEMIES DO GOOD TO THOSE WHO HATE YOU BLESS THOSE WHO CURSE YOU PRAY FOR THOSE WHO ABUSE YOU

TO ONE WHO STRIKES YOU ON THE CHEEK OFFER THE OTHER ALSO AND FROM ONE WHO TAKES AWAY YOUR CLOAK DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR TUNIC EITHER

GIVE TO EVERYONE WHO BEGS FROM YOU AND FROM ONE WHO TAKES AWAY YOUR GOODS DO NOT DEMAND THEM BACK

AND AS YOU WISH THAT OTHERS WOULD DO TO YOU DO SO TO THEM

IF YOU LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE YOU WHAT BENEFIT IS THAT TO YOU

FOR EVEN SINNERS LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE THEM

AND IF YOU DO GOOD TO THOSE WHO DO GOOD TO YOU WHAT BENEFIT IS THAT TO YOU

FOR EVEN SINNERS DO THE SAME

AND IF YOU LEND TO THOSE FROM WHOM YOU EXPECT TO RECEIVE WHAT CREDIT IS THAT TO YOU

EVEN SINNERS LEND TO SINNERS TO GET BACK THE SAME AMOUNT

BUT LOVE YOUR ENEMIES AND DO GOOD AND LEND EXPECTING NOTHING IN RETURN AND YOUR REWARD WILL BE GREAT AND YOU WILL BE SONS OF THE MOST HIGH FOR HE IS KIND TO THE UNGRATEFUL AND THE EVIL

BE MERCIFUL EVEN AS YOUR FATHER IS MERCIFUL

JUDGE NOT AND YOU WILL NOT BE JUDGED; CONDEMN NOT AND YOU WILL NOT BE CONDEMNED; FORGIVE AND YOU WILL BE FORGIVEN; GIVE AND IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU

GOOD MEASURE PRESSED DOWN SHAKEN TOGETHER RUNNING OVER WILL BE PUT INTO YOUR LAP

FOR WITH THE MEASURE YOU USE IT WILL BE MEASURED BACK TO YOU

 HE ALSO TOLD THEM A PARABLE CAN A BLIND MAN LEAD A BLIND MAN

WILL THEY NOT BOTH FALL INTO A PIT

A DISCIPLE IS NOT ABOVE HIS TEACHER BUT EVERYONE WHEN HE IS FULLY TRAINED WILL BE LIKE HIS TEACHER

WHY DO YOU SEE THE SPECK THAT IS IN YOUR BROTHER'S EYE BUT DO NOT NOTICE THE LOG THAT IS IN YOUR OWN EYE

HOW CAN YOU SAY TO YOUR BROTHER 'BROTHER LET ME TAKE OUT THE SPECK THAT IS IN YOUR EYE' WHEN YOU YOURSELF DO NOT SEE THE LOG THAT IS IN YOUR OWN EYE

YOU HYPOCRITE FIRST TAKE THE LOG OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE AND THEN YOU WILL SEE CLEARLY TO TAKE OUT THE SPECK THAT IS IN YOUR BROTHER'S EYE

FOR NO GOOD TREE BEARS BAD FRUIT NOR AGAIN DOES A BAD TREE BEAR GOOD FRUIT FOR EACH TREE IS KNOWN BY ITS OWN FRUIT

FOR FIGS ARE NOT GATHERED FROM THORNBUSHES NOR ARE GRAPES PICKED FROM A BRAMBLE BUSH

THE GOOD PERSON OUT OF THE GOOD TREASURE OF HIS HEART PRODUCES GOOD AND THE EVIL PERSON OUT OF HIS EVIL TREASURE PRODUCES EVIL FOR OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE HEART HIS MOUTH SPEAKS

WHY DO YOU CALL ME 'LORD LORD' AND NOT DO WHAT I TELL YOU

EVERYONE WHO COMES TO ME AND HEARS MY WORDS AND DOES THEM I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT HE IS LIKE HE IS LIKE A MAN BUILDING A HOUSE WHO DUG DEEP AND LAID THE FOUNDATION ON THE ROCK

AND WHEN A FLOOD AROSE THE STREAM BROKE AGAINST THAT HOUSE AND COULD NOT SHAKE IT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN WELL BUILT

BUT THE ONE WHO HEARS AND DOES NOT DO THEM IS LIKE A MAN WHO BUILT A HOUSE ON THE GROUND WITHOUT A FOUNDATION

WHEN THE STREAM BROKE AGAINST IT IMMEDIATELY IT FELL AND THE RUIN OF THAT HOUSE WAS GREAT

AFTER HE HAD FINISHED ALL HIS SAYINGS IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE HE ENTERED CAPERNAUM

NOW A CENTURION HAD A SERVANT WHO WAS SICK AND AT THE POINT OF DEATH WHO WAS HIGHLY VALUED BY HIM

WHEN THE CENTURION HEARD ABOUT JESUS HE SENT TO HIM ELDERS OF THE JEWS ASKING HIM TO COME AND HEAL HIS SERVANT

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO JESUS THEY PLEADED WITH HIM EARNESTLY SAYING HE IS WORTHY TO HAVE YOU DO THIS FOR HIM FOR HE LOVES OUR NATION AND HE IS THE ONE WHO BUILT US OUR SYNAGOGUE

 AND JESUS WENT WITH THEM

WHEN HE WAS NOT FAR FROM THE HOUSE THE CENTURION SENT FRIENDS SAYING TO HIM LORD DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF FOR I AM NOT WORTHY TO HAVE YOU COME UNDER MY ROOF

THEREFORE I DID NOT PRESUME TO COME TO YOU

BUT SAY THE WORD AND LET MY SERVANT BE HEALED

FOR I TOO AM A MAN SET UNDER AUTHORITY WITH SOLDIERS UNDER ME AND I SAY TO ONE 'GO' AND HE GOES; AND TO ANOTHER 'COME' AND HE COMES; AND TO MY SERVANT 'DO THIS' AND HE DOES IT

 WHEN JESUS HEARD THESE THINGS HE MARVELED AT HIM AND TURNING TO THE CROWD THAT FOLLOWED HIM SAID I TELL YOU NOT EVEN IN ISRAEL HAVE I FOUND SUCH FAITH

 AND WHEN THOSE WHO HAD BEEN SENT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE THEY FOUND THE SERVANT WELL

SOON AFTERWARD HE WENT TO A TOWN CALLED NAIN AND HIS DISCIPLES AND A GREAT CROWD WENT WITH HIM

AS HE DREW NEAR TO THE GATE OF THE TOWN BEHOLD A MAN WHO HAD DIED WAS BEING CARRIED OUT THE ONLY SON OF HIS MOTHER AND SHE WAS A WIDOW AND A CONSIDERABLE CROWD FROM THE TOWN WAS WITH HER

AND WHEN THE LORD SAW HER HE HAD COMPASSION ON HER AND SAID TO HER DO NOT WEEP

 THEN HE CAME UP AND TOUCHED THE BIER AND THE BEARERS STOOD STILL

AND HE SAID YOUNG MAN I SAY TO YOU ARISE

 AND THE DEAD MAN SAT UP AND BEGAN TO SPEAK AND JESUS GAVE HIM TO HIS MOTHER

FEAR SEIZED THEM ALL AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD SAYING A GREAT PROPHET HAS ARISEN AMONG US

 AND GOD HAS VISITED HIS PEOPLE

 AND THIS REPORT ABOUT HIM SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE OF JUDEA AND ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY

THE DISCIPLES OF JOHN REPORTED ALL THESE THINGS TO HIM

AND JOHN CALLING TWO OF HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM SENT THEM TO THE LORD SAYING ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS TO COME OR SHALL WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER

 AND WHEN THE MEN HAD COME TO HIM THEY SAID JOHN THE BAPTIST HAS SENT US TO YOU SAYING 'ARE YOU THE ONE WHO IS TO COME OR SHALL WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER

' IN THAT HOUR HE HEALED MANY PEOPLE OF DISEASES AND PLAGUES AND EVIL SPIRITS AND ON MANY WHO WERE BLIND HE BESTOWED SIGHT

AND HE ANSWERED THEM GO AND TELL JOHN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD THE BLIND RECEIVE THEIR SIGHT THE LAME WALK LEPERS ARE CLEANSED AND THE DEAF HEAR THE DEAD ARE RAISED UP THE POOR HAVE GOOD NEWS PREACHED TO THEM

AND BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS NOT OFFENDED BY ME

 WHEN JOHN'S MESSENGERS HAD GONE JESUS BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THE CROWDS CONCERNING JOHN WHAT DID YOU GO OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO SEE

A REED SHAKEN BY THE WIND

WHAT THEN DID YOU GO OUT TO SEE

A MAN DRESSED IN SOFT CLOTHING

BEHOLD THOSE WHO ARE DRESSED IN SPLENDID CLOTHING AND LIVE IN LUXURY ARE IN KINGS' COURTS

WHAT THEN DID YOU GO OUT TO SEE

A PROPHET

YES I TELL YOU AND MORE THAN A PROPHET

THIS IS HE OF WHOM IT IS WRITTEN 'BEHOLD I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU

' I TELL YOU AMONG THOSE BORN OF WOMEN NONE IS GREATER THAN JOHN

YET THE ONE WHO IS LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS GREATER THAN HE

 WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS AND THE TAX COLLECTORS TOO THEY DECLARED GOD JUST HAVING BEEN BAPTIZED WITH THE BAPTISM OF JOHN BUT THE PHARISEES AND THE LAWYERS REJECTED THE PURPOSE OF GOD FOR THEMSELVES NOT HAVING BEEN BAPTIZED BY HIM

 TO WHAT THEN SHALL I COMPARE THE PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION AND WHAT ARE THEY LIKE

THEY ARE LIKE CHILDREN SITTING IN THE MARKETPLACE AND CALLING TO ONE ANOTHER 'WE PLAYED THE FLUTE FOR YOU AND YOU DID NOT DANCE; WE SANG A DIRGE AND YOU DID NOT WEEP

' FOR JOHN THE BAPTIST HAS COME EATING NO BREAD AND DRINKING NO WINE AND YOU SAY 'HE HAS A DEMON

' THE SON OF MAN HAS COME EATING AND DRINKING AND YOU SAY 'LOOK AT HIM

A GLUTTON AND A DRUNKARD A FRIEND OF TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS

' YET WISDOM IS JUSTIFIED BY ALL HER CHILDREN

 ONE OF THE PHARISEES ASKED HIM TO EAT WITH HIM AND HE WENT INTO THE PHARISEE'S HOUSE AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE TABLE

AND BEHOLD A WOMAN OF THE CITY WHO WAS A SINNER WHEN SHE LEARNED THAT HE WAS RECLINING AT TABLE IN THE PHARISEE'S HOUSE BROUGHT AN ALABASTER FLASK OF OINTMENT AND STANDING BEHIND HIM AT HIS FEET WEEPING SHE BEGAN TO WET HIS FEET WITH HER TEARS AND WIPED THEM WITH THE HAIR OF HER HEAD AND KISSED HIS FEET AND ANOINTED THEM WITH THE OINTMENT

NOW WHEN THE PHARISEE WHO HAD INVITED HIM SAW THIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF THIS MAN WERE A PROPHET HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO AND WHAT SORT OF WOMAN THIS IS WHO IS TOUCHING HIM FOR SHE IS A SINNER

 AND JESUS ANSWERING SAID TO HIM SIMON I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU

 AND HE ANSWERED SAY IT TEACHER

 A CERTAIN MONEYLENDER HAD TWO DEBTORS

ONE OWED FIVE HUNDRED DENARII AND THE OTHER FIFTY

WHEN THEY COULD NOT PAY HE CANCELLED THE DEBT OF BOTH

NOW WHICH OF THEM WILL LOVE HIM MORE

 SIMON ANSWERED THE ONE I SUPPOSE FOR WHOM HE CANCELLED THE LARGER DEBT

 AND HE SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE JUDGED RIGHTLY

 THEN TURNING TOWARD THE WOMAN HE SAID TO SIMON DO YOU SEE THIS WOMAN

I ENTERED YOUR HOUSE; YOU GAVE ME NO WATER FOR MY FEET BUT SHE HAS WET MY FEET WITH HER TEARS AND WIPED THEM WITH HER HAIR

YOU GAVE ME NO KISS BUT FROM THE TIME I CAME IN SHE HAS NOT CEASED TO KISS MY FEET

YOU DID NOT ANOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL BUT SHE HAS ANOINTED MY FEET WITH OINTMENT

THEREFORE I TELL YOU HER SINS WHICH ARE MANY ARE FORGIVENFOR SHE LOVED MUCH

BUT HE WHO IS FORGIVEN LITTLE LOVES LITTLE

 AND HE SAID TO HER YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN

 THEN THOSE WHO WERE AT TABLE WITH HIM BEGAN TO SAY AMONG THEMSELVES WHO IS THIS WHO EVEN FORGIVES SINS

 AND HE SAID TO THE WOMAN YOUR FAITH HAS SAVED YOU; GO IN PEACE

SOON AFTERWARD HE WENT ON THROUGH CITIES AND VILLAGES PROCLAIMING AND BRINGING THE GOOD NEWS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AND THE TWELVE WERE WITH HIM AND ALSO SOME WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN HEALED OF EVIL SPIRITS AND INFIRMITIES MARY CALLED MAGDALENE FROM WHOM SEVEN DEMONS HAD GONE OUT AND JOANNA THE WIFE OF CHUZA HEROD'S HOUSEHOLD MANAGER AND SUSANNA AND MANY OTHERS WHO PROVIDED FOR THEM OUT OF THEIR MEANS

AND WHEN A GREAT CROWD WAS GATHERING AND PEOPLE FROM TOWN AFTER TOWN CAME TO HIM HE SAID IN A PARABLE A SOWER WENT OUT TO SOW HIS SEED

AND AS HE SOWED SOME FELL ALONG THE PATH AND WAS TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR DEVOURED IT

AND SOME FELL ON THE ROCK AND AS IT GREW UP IT WITHERED AWAY BECAUSE IT HAD NO MOISTURE

AND SOME FELL AMONG THORNS AND THE THORNS GREW UP WITH IT AND CHOKED IT

AND SOME FELL INTO GOOD SOIL AND GREW AND YIELDED A HUNDREDFOLD

 AS HE SAID THESE THINGS HE CALLED OUT HE WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR

 AND WHEN HIS DISCIPLES ASKED HIM WHAT THIS PARABLE MEANT HE SAID TO YOU IT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO KNOW THE SECRETS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD BUT FOR OTHERS THEY ARE IN PARABLES SO THAT 'SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND

' NOW THE PARABLE IS THIS THE SEED IS THE WORD OF GOD

THE ONES ALONG THE PATH ARE THOSE WHO HAVE HEARD

THEN THE DEVIL COMES AND TAKES AWAY THE WORD FROM THEIR HEARTS SO THAT THEY MAY NOT BELIEVE AND BE SAVED

AND THE ONES ON THE ROCK ARE THOSE WHO WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD RECEIVE IT WITH JOY

BUT THESE HAVE NO ROOT; THEY BELIEVE FOR A WHILE AND IN TIME OF TESTING FALL AWAY

AND AS FOR WHAT FELL AMONG THE THORNS THEY ARE THOSE WHO HEAR BUT AS THEY GO ON THEIR WAY THEY ARE CHOKED BY THE CARES AND RICHES AND PLEASURES OF LIFE AND THEIR FRUIT DOES NOT MATURE

AS FOR THAT IN THE GOOD SOIL THEY ARE THOSE WHO HEARING THE WORD HOLD IT FAST IN AN HONEST AND GOOD HEART AND BEAR FRUIT WITH PATIENCE

NO ONE AFTER LIGHTING A LAMP COVERS IT WITH A JAR OR PUTS IT UNDER A BED BUT PUTS IT ON A STAND SO THAT THOSE WHO ENTER MAY SEE THE LIGHT

FOR NOTHING IS HIDDEN THAT WILL NOT BE MADE MANIFEST NOR IS ANYTHING SECRET THAT WILL NOT BE KNOWN AND COME TO LIGHT

TAKE CARE THEN HOW YOU HEAR FOR TO THE ONE WHO HAS MORE WILL BE GIVEN AND FROM THE ONE WHO HAS NOT EVEN WHAT HE THINKS THAT HE HAS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY

 THEN HIS MOTHER AND HIS BROTHERS CAME TO HIM BUT THEY COULD NOT REACH HIM BECAUSE OF THE CROWD

AND HE WAS TOLD YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHERS ARE STANDING OUTSIDE DESIRING TO SEE YOU

 BUT HE ANSWERED THEM MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS ARE THOSE WHO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD AND DO IT

 ONE DAY HE GOT INTO A BOAT WITH HIS DISCIPLES AND HE SAID TO THEM LET US GO ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE

 SO THEY SET OUT AND AS THEY SAILED HE FELL ASLEEP

AND A WINDSTORM CAME DOWN ON THE LAKE AND THEY WERE FILLING WITH WATER AND WERE IN DANGER

AND THEY WENT AND WOKE HIM SAYING MASTER MASTER WE ARE PERISHING

 AND HE AWOKE AND REBUKED THE WIND AND THE RAGING WAVES AND THEY CEASED AND THERE WAS A CALM

HE SAID TO THEM WHERE IS YOUR FAITH

 AND THEY WERE AFRAID AND THEY MARVELED SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER WHO THEN IS THIS THAT HE COMMANDS EVEN WINDS AND WATER AND THEY OBEY HIM

 THEN THEY SAILED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GERASENES WHICH IS OPPOSITE GALILEE

WHEN JESUS HAD STEPPED OUT ON LAND THERE MET HIM A MAN FROM THE CITY WHO HAD DEMONS

FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WORN NO CLOTHES AND HE HAD NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE BUT AMONG THE TOMBS

WHEN HE SAW JESUS HE CRIED OUT AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM AND SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH ME JESUS SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD

I BEG YOU DO NOT TORMENT ME

 FOR HE HAD COMMANDED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT TO COME OUT OF THE MAN

FOR MANY A TIME IT HAD SEIZED HIM

HE WAS KEPT UNDER GUARD AND BOUND WITH CHAINS AND SHACKLES BUT HE WOULD BREAK THE BONDS AND BE DRIVEN BY THE DEMON INTO THE DESERT

 JESUS THEN ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR NAME

 AND HE SAID LEGION FOR MANY DEMONS HAD ENTERED HIM

AND THEY BEGGED HIM NOT TO COMMAND THEM TO DEPART INTO THE ABYSS

NOW A LARGE HERD OF PIGS WAS FEEDING THERE ON THE HILLSIDE AND THEY BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM ENTER THESE

SO HE GAVE THEM PERMISSION

THEN THE DEMONS CAME OUT OF THE MAN AND ENTERED THE PIGS AND THE HERD RUSHED DOWN THE STEEP BANK INTO THE LAKE AND WERE DROWNED

WHEN THE HERDSMEN SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY FLED AND TOLD IT IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY

THEN PEOPLE WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY CAME TO JESUS AND FOUND THE MAN FROM WHOM THE DEMONS HAD GONE SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS CLOTHED AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND AND THEY WERE AFRAID

AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN IT TOLD THEM HOW THE DEMONPOSSESSED MAN HAD BEEN HEALED

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY OF THE GERASENES ASKED HIM TO DEPART FROM THEM FOR THEY WERE SEIZED WITH GREAT FEAR

SO HE GOT INTO THE BOAT AND RETURNED

THE MAN FROM WHOM THE DEMONS HAD GONE BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT BE WITH HIM BUT JESUS SENT HIM AWAY SAYING RETURN TO YOUR HOME AND DECLARE HOW MUCH GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU

 AND HE WENT AWAY PROCLAIMING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY HOW MUCH JESUS HAD DONE FOR HIM

NOW WHEN JESUS RETURNED THE CROWD WELCOMED HIM FOR THEY WERE ALL WAITING FOR HIM

AND THERE CAME A MAN NAMED JAIRUS WHO WAS A RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE

AND FALLING AT JESUS' FEET HE IMPLORED HIM TO COME TO HIS HOUSE FOR HE HAD AN ONLY DAUGHTER ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND SHE WAS DYING

AS JESUS WENT THE PEOPLE PRESSED AROUND HIM

AND THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR TWELVE YEARS AND THOUGH SHE HAD SPENT ALL HER LIVING ON PHYSICIANS SHE COULD NOT BE HEALED BY ANYONE

SHE CAME UP BEHIND HIM AND TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF HIS GARMENT AND IMMEDIATELY HER DISCHARGE OF BLOOD CEASED

AND JESUS SAID WHO WAS IT THAT TOUCHED ME

 WHEN ALL DENIED IT PETER SAID MASTER THE CROWDS SURROUND YOU AND ARE PRESSING IN ON YOU

 BUT JESUS SAID SOMEONE TOUCHED ME FOR I PERCEIVE THAT POWER HAS GONE OUT FROM ME

 AND WHEN THE WOMAN SAW THAT SHE WAS NOT HIDDEN SHE CAME TREMBLING AND FALLING DOWN BEFORE HIM DECLARED IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHY SHE HAD TOUCHED HIM AND HOW SHE HAD BEEN IMMEDIATELY HEALED

AND HE SAID TO HER DAUGHTER YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL; GO IN PEACE

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING SOMEONE FROM THE RULER'S HOUSE CAME AND SAID YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD; DO NOT TROUBLE THE TEACHER ANY MORE

 BUT JESUS ON HEARING THIS ANSWERED HIM DO NOT FEAR; ONLY BELIEVE AND SHE WILL BE WELL

 AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE HOUSE HE ALLOWED NO ONE TO ENTER WITH HIM EXCEPT PETER AND JOHN AND JAMES AND THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF THE CHILD

AND ALL WERE WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR HER BUT HE SAID DO NOT WEEP FOR SHE IS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPING

 AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM KNOWING THAT SHE WAS DEAD

BUT TAKING HER BY THE HAND HE CALLED SAYING CHILD ARISE

 AND HER SPIRIT RETURNED AND SHE GOT UP AT ONCE

AND HE DIRECTED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE GIVEN HER TO EAT

AND HER PARENTS WERE AMAZED BUT HE CHARGED THEM TO TELL NO ONE WHAT HAD HAPPENED

AND HE CALLED THE TWELVE TOGETHER AND GAVE THEM POWER AND AUTHORITY OVER ALL DEMONS AND TO CURE DISEASES AND HE SENT THEM OUT TO PROCLAIM THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND TO HEAL

AND HE SAID TO THEM TAKE NOTHING FOR YOUR JOURNEY NO STAFF NOR BAG NOR BREAD NOR MONEY; AND DO NOT HAVE TWO TUNICS

AND WHATEVER HOUSE YOU ENTER STAY THERE AND FROM THERE DEPART

AND WHEREVER THEY DO NOT RECEIVE YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE THAT TOWN SHAKE OFF THE DUST FROM YOUR FEET AS A TESTIMONY AGAINST THEM

 AND THEY DEPARTED AND WENT THROUGH THE VILLAGES PREACHING THE GOSPEL AND HEALING EVERYWHERE

NOW HEROD THE TETRARCH HEARD ABOUT ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING AND HE WAS PERPLEXED BECAUSE IT WAS SAID BY SOME THAT JOHN HAD BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD BY SOME THAT ELIJAH HAD APPEARED AND BY OTHERS THAT ONE OF THE PROPHETS OF OLD HAD RISEN

HEROD SAID JOHN I BEHEADED BUT WHO IS THIS ABOUT WHOM I HEAR SUCH THINGS

 AND HE SOUGHT TO SEE HIM

ON THEIR RETURN THE APOSTLES TOLD HIM ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE

AND HE TOOK THEM AND WITHDREW APART TO A TOWN CALLED BETHSAIDA

WHEN THE CROWDS LEARNED IT THEY FOLLOWED HIM AND HE WELCOMED THEM AND SPOKE TO THEM OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND CURED THOSE WHO HAD NEED OF HEALING

NOW THE DAY BEGAN TO WEAR AWAY AND THE TWELVE CAME AND SAID TO HIM SEND THE CROWD AWAY TO GO INTO THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND COUNTRYSIDE TO FIND LODGING AND GET PROVISIONS FOR WE ARE HERE IN A DESOLATE PLACE

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT

 THEY SAID WE HAVE NO MORE THAN FIVE LOAVES AND TWO FISHUNLESS WE ARE TO GO AND BUY FOOD FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE

 FOR THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MEN

AND HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES HAVE THEM SIT DOWN IN GROUPS OF ABOUT FIFTY EACH

 AND THEY DID SO AND HAD THEM ALL SIT DOWN

AND TAKING THE FIVE LOAVES AND THE TWO FISH HE LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND SAID A BLESSING OVER THEM

THEN HE BROKE THE LOAVES AND GAVE THEM TO THE DISCIPLES TO SET BEFORE THE CROWD

AND THEY ALL ATE AND WERE SATISFIED

AND WHAT WAS LEFT OVER WAS PICKED UP TWELVE BASKETS OF BROKEN PIECES

NOW IT HAPPENED THAT AS HE WAS PRAYING ALONE THE DISCIPLES WERE WITH HIM

AND HE ASKED THEM WHO DO THE CROWDS SAY THAT I AM

 AND THEY ANSWERED JOHN THE BAPTIST

BUT OTHERS SAY ELIJAH AND OTHERS THAT ONE OF THE PROPHETS OF OLD HAS RISEN

 THEN HE SAID TO THEM BUT WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM

 AND PETER ANSWERED THE CHRIST OF GOD

 AND HE STRICTLY CHARGED AND COMMANDED THEM TO TELL THIS TO NO ONE SAYING THE SON OF MAN MUST SUFFER MANY THINGS AND BE REJECTED BY THE ELDERS AND CHIEF PRIESTS AND SCRIBES AND BE KILLED AND ON THE THIRD DAY BE RAISED

 AND HE SAID TO ALL IF ANYONE WOULD COME AFTER ME LET HIM DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS DAILY AND FOLLOW ME

FOR WHOEVER WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE WILL LOSE IT BUT WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE FOR MY SAKE WILL SAVE IT

FOR WHAT DOES IT PROFIT A MAN IF HE GAINS THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSES OR FORFEITS HIMSELF

FOR WHOEVER IS ASHAMED OF ME AND OF MY WORDS OF HIM WILL THE SON OF MAN BE ASHAMED WHEN HE COMES IN HIS GLORY AND THE GLORY OF THE FATHER AND OF THE HOLY ANGELS

BUT I TELL YOU TRULY THERE ARE SOME STANDING HERE WHO WILL NOT TASTE DEATH UNTIL THEY SEE THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 NOW ABOUT EIGHT DAYS AFTER THESE SAYINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM PETER AND JOHN AND JAMES AND WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN TO PRAY

AND AS HE WAS PRAYING THE APPEARANCE OF HIS FACE WAS ALTERED AND HIS CLOTHING BECAME DAZZLING WHITE

AND BEHOLD TWO MEN WERE TALKING WITH HIM MOSES AND ELIJAH WHO APPEARED IN GLORY AND SPOKE OF HIS DEPARTURE WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO ACCOMPLISH AT JERUSALEM

NOW PETER AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM WERE HEAVY WITH SLEEP BUT WHEN THEY BECAME FULLY AWAKE THEY SAW HIS GLORY AND THE TWO MEN WHO STOOD WITH HIM

AND AS THE MEN WERE PARTING FROM HIM PETER SAID TO JESUS MASTER IT IS GOOD THAT WE ARE HERE

LET US MAKE THREE TENTS ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR MOSES AND ONE FOR ELIJAHNOT KNOWING WHAT HE SAID

AS HE WAS SAYING THESE THINGS A CLOUD CAME AND OVERSHADOWED THEM AND THEY WERE AFRAID AS THEY ENTERED THE CLOUD

AND A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE CLOUD SAYING THIS IS MY SON MY CHOSEN ONE; LISTEN TO HIM

 AND WHEN THE VOICE HAD SPOKEN JESUS WAS FOUND ALONE

AND THEY KEPT SILENT AND TOLD NO ONE IN THOSE DAYS ANYTHING OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN

ON THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY HAD COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN A GREAT CROWD MET HIM

AND BEHOLD A MAN FROM THE CROWD CRIED OUT TEACHER I BEG YOU TO LOOK AT MY SON FOR HE IS MY ONLY CHILD

AND BEHOLD A SPIRIT SEIZES HIM AND HE SUDDENLY CRIES OUT

IT CONVULSES HIM SO THAT HE FOAMS AT THE MOUTH; AND SHATTERS HIM AND WILL HARDLY LEAVE HIM

AND I BEGGED YOUR DISCIPLES TO CAST IT OUT BUT THEY COULD NOT

 JESUS ANSWERED O FAITHLESS AND TWISTED GENERATION HOW LONG AM I TO BE WITH YOU AND BEAR WITH YOU

BRING YOUR SON HERE

 WHILE HE WAS COMING THE DEMON THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND CONVULSED HIM

BUT JESUS REBUKED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT AND HEALED THE BOY AND GAVE HIM BACK TO HIS FATHER

AND ALL WERE ASTONISHED AT THE MAJESTY OF GOD

BUT WHILE THEY WERE ALL MARVELING AT EVERYTHING HE WAS DOING JESUS SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES LET THESE WORDS SINK INTO YOUR EARS THE SON OF MAN IS ABOUT TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF MEN

 BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS SAYING AND IT WAS CONCEALED FROM THEM SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT PERCEIVE IT

AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO ASK HIM ABOUT THIS SAYING

AN ARGUMENT AROSE AMONG THEM AS TO WHICH OF THEM WAS THE GREATEST

BUT JESUS KNOWING THE REASONING OF THEIR HEARTS TOOK A CHILD AND PUT HIM BY HIS SIDE AND SAID TO THEM WHOEVER RECEIVES THIS CHILD IN MY NAME RECEIVES ME AND WHOEVER RECEIVES ME RECEIVES HIM WHO SENT ME

FOR HE WHO IS LEAST AMONG YOU ALL IS THE ONE WHO IS GREAT

 JOHN ANSWERED MASTER WE SAW SOMEONE CASTING OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME AND WE TRIED TO STOP HIM BECAUSE HE DOES NOT FOLLOW WITH US

 BUT JESUS SAID TO HIM DO NOT STOP HIM FOR THE ONE WHO IS NOT AGAINST YOU IS FOR YOU

 WHEN THE DAYS DREW NEAR FOR HIM TO BE TAKEN UP HE SET HIS FACE TO GO TO JERUSALEM

AND HE SENT MESSENGERS AHEAD OF HIM WHO WENT AND ENTERED A VILLAGE OF THE SAMARITANS TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HIM

BUT THE PEOPLE DID NOT RECEIVE HIM BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS SET TOWARD JERUSALEM

AND WHEN HIS DISCIPLES JAMES AND JOHN SAW IT THEY SAID LORD DO YOU WANT US TO TELL FIRE TO COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUME THEM

 BUT HE TURNED AND REBUKED THEM

AND THEY WENT ON TO ANOTHER VILLAGE

AS THEY WERE GOING ALONG THE ROAD SOMEONE SAID TO HIM I WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM FOXES HAVE HOLES AND BIRDS OF THE AIR HAVE NESTS BUT THE SON OF MAN HAS NOWHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD

 TO ANOTHER HE SAID FOLLOW ME

 BUT HE SAID LORD LET ME FIRST GO AND BURY MY FATHER

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM LEAVE THE DEAD TO BURY THEIR OWN DEAD

BUT AS FOR YOU GO AND PROCLAIM THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 YET ANOTHER SAID I WILL FOLLOW YOU LORD BUT LET ME FIRST SAY FAREWELL TO THOSE AT MY HOME

 JESUS SAID TO HIM NO ONE WHO PUTS HIS HAND TO THE PLOW AND LOOKS BACK IS FIT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AFTER THIS THE LORD APPOINTED SEVENTYTWO OTHERS AND SENT THEM ON AHEAD OF HIM TWO BY TWO INTO EVERY TOWN AND PLACE WHERE HE HIMSELF WAS ABOUT TO GO

AND HE SAID TO THEM THE HARVEST IS PLENTIFUL BUT THE LABORERS ARE FEW

THEREFORE PRAY EARNESTLY TO THE LORD OF THE HARVEST TO SEND OUT LABORERS INTO HIS HARVEST

GO YOUR WAY; BEHOLD I AM SENDING YOU OUT AS LAMBS IN THE MIDST OF WOLVES

CARRY NO MONEYBAG NO KNAPSACK NO SANDALS AND GREET NO ONE ON THE ROAD

WHATEVER HOUSE YOU ENTER FIRST SAY 'PEACE BE TO THIS HOUSE

' AND IF A SON OF PEACE IS THERE YOUR PEACE WILL REST UPON HIM

BUT IF NOT IT WILL RETURN TO YOU

AND REMAIN IN THE SAME HOUSE EATING AND DRINKING WHAT THEY PROVIDE FOR THE LABORER DESERVES HIS WAGES

DO NOT GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE

WHENEVER YOU ENTER A TOWN AND THEY RECEIVE YOU EAT WHAT IS SET BEFORE YOU

HEAL THE SICK IN IT AND SAY TO THEM 'THE KINGDOM OF GOD HAS COME NEAR TO YOU

' BUT WHENEVER YOU ENTER A TOWN AND THEY DO NOT RECEIVE YOU GO INTO ITS STREETS AND SAY 'EVEN THE DUST OF YOUR TOWN THAT CLINGS TO OUR FEET WE WIPE OFF AGAINST YOU

NEVERTHELESS KNOW THIS THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD HAS COME NEAR

' I TELL YOU IT WILL BE MORE BEARABLE ON THAT DAY FOR SODOM THAN FOR THAT TOWN

WOE TO YOU CHORAZIN

WOE TO YOU BETHSAIDA

FOR IF THE MIGHTY WORKS DONE IN YOU HAD BEEN DONE IN TYRE AND SIDON THEY WOULD HAVE REPENTED LONG AGO SITTING IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES

BUT IT WILL BE MORE BEARABLE IN THE JUDGMENT FOR TYRE AND SIDON THAN FOR YOU

AND YOU CAPERNAUM WILL YOU BE EXALTED TO HEAVEN

YOU SHALL BE BROUGHT DOWN TO HADES

THE ONE WHO HEARS YOU HEARS ME AND THE ONE WHO REJECTS YOU REJECTS ME AND THE ONE WHO REJECTS ME REJECTS HIM WHO SENT ME

 THE SEVENTYTWO RETURNED WITH JOY SAYING LORD EVEN THE DEMONS ARE SUBJECT TO US IN YOUR NAME

 AND HE SAID TO THEM I SAW SATAN FALL LIKE LIGHTNING FROM HEAVEN

BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOU AUTHORITY TO TREAD ON SERPENTS AND SCORPIONS AND OVER ALL THE POWER OF THE ENEMY AND NOTHING SHALL HURT YOU

NEVERTHELESS DO NOT REJOICE IN THIS THAT THE SPIRITS ARE SUBJECT TO YOU BUT REJOICE THAT YOUR NAMES ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN

 IN THAT SAME HOUR HE REJOICED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT AND SAID I THANK YOU FATHER LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND UNDERSTANDING AND REVEALED THEM TO LITTLE CHILDREN; YES FATHER FOR SUCH WAS YOUR GRACIOUS WILL

ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER TO ME BY MY FATHER AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO THE SON IS EXCEPT THE FATHER OR WHO THE FATHER IS EXCEPT THE SON AND ANYONE TO WHOM THE SON CHOOSES TO REVEAL HIM

 THEN TURNING TO THE DISCIPLES HE SAID PRIVATELY BLESSED ARE THE EYES THAT SEE WHAT YOU SEE

FOR I TELL YOU THAT MANY PROPHETS AND KINGS DESIRED TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AND DID NOT SEE IT AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR AND DID NOT HEAR IT

 AND BEHOLD A LAWYER STOOD UP TO PUT HIM TO THE TEST SAYING TEACHER WHAT SHALL I DO TO INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE

 HE SAID TO HIM WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW

HOW DO YOU READ IT

 AND HE ANSWERED YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

 AND HE SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE ANSWERED CORRECTLY; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE

 BUT HE DESIRING TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF SAID TO JESUS AND WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR

 JESUS REPLIED A MAN WAS GOING DOWN FROM JERUSALEM TO JERICHO AND HE FELL AMONG ROBBERS WHO STRIPPED HIM AND BEAT HIM AND DEPARTED LEAVING HIM HALF DEAD

NOW BY CHANCE A PRIEST WAS GOING DOWN THAT ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW HIM HE PASSED BY ON THE OTHER SIDE

SO LIKEWISE A LEVITE WHEN HE CAME TO THE PLACE AND SAW HIM PASSED BY ON THE OTHER SIDE

BUT A SAMARITAN AS HE JOURNEYED CAME TO WHERE HE WAS AND WHEN HE SAW HIM HE HAD COMPASSION

HE WENT TO HIM AND BOUND UP HIS WOUNDS POURING ON OIL AND WINE

THEN HE SET HIM ON HIS OWN ANIMAL AND BROUGHT HIM TO AN INN AND TOOK CARE OF HIM

AND THE NEXT DAY HE TOOK OUT TWO DENARII AND GAVE THEM TO THE INNKEEPER SAYING 'TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WHATEVER MORE YOU SPEND I WILL REPAY YOU WHEN I COME BACK

' WHICH OF THESE THREE DO YOU THINK PROVED TO BE A NEIGHBOR TO THE MAN WHO FELL AMONG THE ROBBERS

 HE SAID THE ONE WHO SHOWED HIM MERCY

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM YOU GO AND DO LIKEWISE

 NOW AS THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY JESUS ENTERED A VILLAGE

AND A WOMAN NAMED MARTHA WELCOMED HIM INTO HER HOUSE

AND SHE HAD A SISTER CALLED MARY WHO SAT AT THE LORD'S FEET AND LISTENED TO HIS TEACHING

BUT MARTHA WAS DISTRACTED WITH MUCH SERVING

AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND SAID LORD DO YOU NOT CARE THAT MY SISTER HAS LEFT ME TO SERVE ALONE

TELL HER THEN TO HELP ME

 BUT THE LORD ANSWERED HER MARTHA MARTHA YOU ARE ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS BUT ONE THING IS NECESSARY

MARY HAS CHOSEN THE GOOD PORTION WHICH WILL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER

NOW JESUS WAS PRAYING IN A CERTAIN PLACE AND WHEN HE FINISHED ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM LORD TEACH US TO PRAY AS JOHN TAUGHT HIS DISCIPLES

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHEN YOU PRAY SAY FATHER HALLOWED BE YOUR NAME

YOUR KINGDOM COME

GIVE US EACH DAY OUR DAILY BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR SINS FOR WE OURSELVES FORGIVE EVERYONE WHO IS INDEBTED TO US

AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHICH OF YOU WHO HAS A FRIEND WILL GO TO HIM AT MIDNIGHT AND SAY TO HIM 'FRIEND LEND ME THREE LOAVES FOR A FRIEND OF MINE HAS ARRIVED ON A JOURNEY AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SET BEFORE HIM'; AND HE WILL ANSWER FROM WITHIN 'DO NOT BOTHER ME; THE DOOR IS NOW SHUT AND MY CHILDREN ARE WITH ME IN BED

I CANNOT GET UP AND GIVE YOU ANYTHING'

I TELL YOU THOUGH HE WILL NOT GET UP AND GIVE HIM ANYTHING BECAUSE HE IS HIS FRIEND YET BECAUSE OF HIS IMPUDENCE HE WILL RISE AND GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE NEEDS

AND I TELL YOU ASK AND IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU; SEEK AND YOU WILL FIND; KNOCK AND IT WILL BE OPENED TO YOU

FOR EVERYONE WHO ASKS RECEIVES AND THE ONE WHO SEEKS FINDS AND TO THE ONE WHO KNOCKS IT WILL BE OPENED

WHAT FATHER AMONG YOU IF HIS SON ASKS FOR A FISH WILL INSTEAD OF A FISH GIVE HIM A SERPENT; OR IF HE ASKS FOR AN EGG WILL GIVE HIM A SCORPION

IF YOU THEN WHO ARE EVIL KNOW HOW TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS TO YOUR CHILDREN HOW MUCH MORE WILL THE HEAVENLY FATHER GIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT TO THOSE WHO ASK HIM

 NOW HE WAS CASTING OUT A DEMON THAT WAS MUTE

WHEN THE DEMON HAD GONE OUT THE MUTE MAN SPOKE AND THE PEOPLE MARVELED

BUT SOME OF THEM SAID HE CASTS OUT DEMONS BY BEELZEBUL THE PRINCE OF DEMONS WHILE OTHERS TO TEST HIM KEPT SEEKING FROM HIM A SIGN FROM HEAVEN

BUT HE KNOWING THEIR THOUGHTS SAID TO THEM EVERY KINGDOM DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF IS LAID WASTE AND A DIVIDED HOUSEHOLD FALLS

AND IF SATAN ALSO IS DIVIDED AGAINST HIMSELF HOW WILL HIS KINGDOM STAND

FOR YOU SAY THAT I CAST OUT DEMONS BY BEELZEBUL

AND IF I CAST OUT DEMONS BY BEELZEBUL BY WHOM DO YOUR SONS CAST THEM OUT

THEREFORE THEY WILL BE YOUR JUDGES

BUT IF IT IS BY THE FINGER OF GOD THAT I CAST OUT DEMONS THEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD HAS COME UPON YOU

WHEN A STRONG MAN FULLY ARMED GUARDS HIS OWN PALACE HIS GOODS ARE SAFE; BUT WHEN ONE STRONGER THAN HE ATTACKS HIM AND OVERCOMES HIM HE TAKES AWAY HIS ARMOR IN WHICH HE TRUSTED AND DIVIDES HIS SPOIL

WHOEVER IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME AND WHOEVER DOES NOT GATHER WITH ME SCATTERS

WHEN THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT HAS GONE OUT OF A PERSON IT PASSES THROUGH WATERLESS PLACES SEEKING REST AND FINDING NONE IT SAYS 'I WILL RETURN TO MY HOUSE FROM WHICH I CAME

' AND WHEN IT COMES IT FINDS THE HOUSE SWEPT AND PUT IN ORDER

THEN IT GOES AND BRINGS SEVEN OTHER SPIRITS MORE EVIL THAN ITSELF AND THEY ENTER AND DWELL THERE

AND THE LAST STATE OF THAT PERSON IS WORSE THAN THE FIRST

 AS HE SAID THESE THINGS A WOMAN IN THE CROWD RAISED HER VOICE AND SAID TO HIM BLESSED IS THE WOMB THAT BORE YOU AND THE BREASTS AT WHICH YOU NURSED

 BUT HE SAID BLESSED RATHER ARE THOSE WHO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD AND KEEP IT

 WHEN THE CROWDS WERE INCREASING HE BEGAN TO SAY THIS GENERATION IS AN EVIL GENERATION

IT SEEKS FOR A SIGN BUT NO SIGN WILL BE GIVEN TO IT EXCEPT THE SIGN OF JONAH

FOR AS JONAH BECAME A SIGN TO THE PEOPLE OF NINEVEH SO WILL THE SON OF MAN BE TO THIS GENERATION

THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH WILL RISE UP AT THE JUDGMENT WITH THE MEN OF THIS GENERATION AND CONDEMN THEM FOR SHE CAME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO HEAR THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON AND BEHOLD SOMETHING GREATER THAN SOLOMON IS HERE

THE MEN OF NINEVEH WILL RISE UP AT THE JUDGMENT WITH THIS GENERATION AND CONDEMN IT FOR THEY REPENTED AT THE PREACHING OF JONAH AND BEHOLD SOMETHING GREATER THAN JONAH IS HERE

NO ONE AFTER LIGHTING A LAMP PUTS IT IN A CELLAR OR UNDER A BASKET BUT ON A STAND SO THAT THOSE WHO ENTER MAY SEE THE LIGHT

YOUR EYE IS THE LAMP OF YOUR BODY

WHEN YOUR EYE IS HEALTHY YOUR WHOLE BODY IS FULL OF LIGHT BUT WHEN IT IS BAD YOUR BODY IS FULL OF DARKNESS

THEREFORE BE CAREFUL LEST THE LIGHT IN YOU BE DARKNESS

IF THEN YOUR WHOLE BODY IS FULL OF LIGHT HAVING NO PART DARK IT WILL BE WHOLLY BRIGHT AS WHEN A LAMP WITH ITS RAYS GIVES YOU LIGHT

 WHILE JESUS WAS SPEAKING A PHARISEE ASKED HIM TO DINE WITH HIM SO HE WENT IN AND RECLINED AT TABLE

THE PHARISEE WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THAT HE DID NOT FIRST WASH BEFORE DINNER

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM NOW YOU PHARISEES CLEANSE THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND OF THE DISH BUT INSIDE YOU ARE FULL OF GREED AND WICKEDNESS

YOU FOOLS

DID NOT HE WHO MADE THE OUTSIDE MAKE THE INSIDE ALSO

BUT GIVE AS ALMS THOSE THINGS THAT ARE WITHIN AND BEHOLD EVERYTHING IS CLEAN FOR YOU

BUT WOE TO YOU PHARISEES

FOR YOU TITHE MINT AND RUE AND EVERY HERB AND NEGLECT JUSTICE AND THE LOVE OF GOD

THESE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITHOUT NEGLECTING THE OTHERS

WOE TO YOU PHARISEES

FOR YOU LOVE THE BEST SEAT IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND GREETINGS IN THE MARKETPLACES

WOE TO YOU

FOR YOU ARE LIKE UNMARKED GRAVES AND PEOPLE WALK OVER THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT

 ONE OF THE LAWYERS ANSWERED HIM TEACHER IN SAYING THESE THINGS YOU INSULT US ALSO

 AND HE SAID WOE TO YOU LAWYERS ALSO

FOR YOU LOAD PEOPLE WITH BURDENS HARD TO BEAR AND YOU YOURSELVES DO NOT TOUCH THE BURDENS WITH ONE OF YOUR FINGERS

WOE TO YOU

FOR YOU BUILD THE TOMBS OF THE PROPHETS WHOM YOUR FATHERS KILLED

SO YOU ARE WITNESSES AND YOU CONSENT TO THE DEEDS OF YOUR FATHERS FOR THEY KILLED THEM AND YOU BUILD THEIR TOMBS

THEREFORE ALSO THE WISDOM OF GOD SAID 'I WILL SEND THEM PROPHETS AND APOSTLES SOME OF WHOM THEY WILL KILL AND PERSECUTE' SO THAT THE BLOOD OF ALL THE PROPHETS SHED FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD MAY BE CHARGED AGAINST THIS GENERATION FROM THE BLOOD OF ABEL TO THE BLOOD OF ZECHARIAH WHO PERISHED BETWEEN THE ALTAR AND THE SANCTUARY

YES I TELL YOU IT WILL BE REQUIRED OF THIS GENERATION

WOE TO YOU LAWYERS

FOR YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE KEY OF KNOWLEDGE

YOU DID NOT ENTER YOURSELVES AND YOU HINDERED THOSE WHO WERE ENTERING

 AS HE WENT AWAY FROM THERE THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES BEGAN TO PRESS HIM HARD AND TO PROVOKE HIM TO SPEAK ABOUT MANY THINGS LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM TO CATCH HIM IN SOMETHING HE MIGHT SAY

IN THE MEANTIME WHEN SO MANY THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER THAT THEY WERE TRAMPLING ONE ANOTHER HE BEGAN TO SAY TO HIS DISCIPLES FIRST BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES WHICH IS HYPOCRISY

NOTHING IS COVERED UP THAT WILL NOT BE REVEALED OR HIDDEN THAT WILL NOT BE KNOWN

THEREFORE WHATEVER YOU HAVE SAID IN THE DARK SHALL BE HEARD IN THE LIGHT AND WHAT YOU HAVE WHISPERED IN PRIVATE ROOMS SHALL BE PROCLAIMED ON THE HOUSETOPS

I TELL YOU MY FRIENDS DO NOT FEAR THOSE WHO KILL THE BODY AND AFTER THAT HAVE NOTHING MORE THAT THEY CAN DO

BUT I WILL WARN YOU WHOM TO FEAR FEAR HIM WHO AFTER HE HAS KILLED HAS AUTHORITY TO CAST INTO HELL

YES I TELL YOU FEAR HIM

ARE NOT FIVE SPARROWS SOLD FOR TWO PENNIES

AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS FORGOTTEN BEFORE GOD

WHY EVEN THE HAIRS OF YOUR HEAD ARE ALL NUMBERED

FEAR NOT; YOU ARE OF MORE VALUE THAN MANY SPARROWS

AND I TELL YOU EVERYONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGES ME BEFORE MEN THE SON OF MAN ALSO WILL ACKNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE ANGELS OF GOD BUT THE ONE WHO DENIES ME BEFORE MEN WILL BE DENIED BEFORE THE ANGELS OF GOD

AND EVERYONE WHO SPEAKS A WORD AGAINST THE SON OF MAN WILL BE FORGIVEN BUT THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN

AND WHEN THEY BRING YOU BEFORE THE SYNAGOGUES AND THE RULERS AND THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD DEFEND YOURSELF OR WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL TEACH YOU IN THAT VERY HOUR WHAT YOU OUGHT TO SAY

 SOMEONE IN THE CROWD SAID TO HIM TEACHER TELL MY BROTHER TO DIVIDE THE INHERITANCE WITH ME

 BUT HE SAID TO HIM MAN WHO MADE ME A JUDGE OR ARBITRATOR OVER YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM TAKE CARE AND BE ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST ALL COVETOUSNESS FOR ONE'S LIFE DOES NOT CONSIST IN THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS POSSESSIONS

 AND HE TOLD THEM A PARABLE SAYING THE LAND OF A RICH MAN PRODUCED PLENTIFULLY AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF 'WHAT SHALL I DO FOR I HAVE NOWHERE TO STORE MY CROPS

' AND HE SAID 'I WILL DO THIS I WILL TEAR DOWN MY BARNS AND BUILD LARGER ONES AND THERE I WILL STORE ALL MY GRAIN AND MY GOODS

AND I WILL SAY TO MY SOUL SOUL YOU HAVE AMPLE GOODS LAID UP FOR MANY YEARS; RELAX EAT DRINK BE MERRY

' BUT GOD SAID TO HIM 'FOOL

THIS NIGHT YOUR SOUL IS REQUIRED OF YOU AND THE THINGS YOU HAVE PREPARED WHOSE WILL THEY BE

' SO IS THE ONE WHO LAYS UP TREASURE FOR HIMSELF AND IS NOT RICH TOWARD GOD

 AND HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES THEREFORE I TELL YOU DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU WILL EAT NOR ABOUT YOUR BODY WHAT YOU WILL PUT ON

FOR LIFE IS MORE THAN FOOD AND THE BODY MORE THAN CLOTHING

CONSIDER THE RAVENS THEY NEITHER SOW NOR REAP THEY HAVE NEITHER STOREHOUSE NOR BARN AND YET GOD FEEDS THEM

OF HOW MUCH MORE VALUE ARE YOU THAN THE BIRDS

AND WHICH OF YOU BY BEING ANXIOUS CAN ADD A SINGLE HOUR TO HIS SPAN OF LIFE

IF THEN YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DO AS SMALL A THING AS THAT WHY ARE YOU ANXIOUS ABOUT THE REST

CONSIDER THE LILIES HOW THEY GROW THEY NEITHER TOIL NOR SPIN YET I TELL YOU EVEN SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY WAS NOT ARRAYED LIKE ONE OF THESE

BUT IF GOD SO CLOTHES THE GRASS WHICH IS ALIVE IN THE FIELD TODAY AND TOMORROW IS THROWN INTO THE OVEN HOW MUCH MORE WILL HE CLOTHE YOU O YOU OF LITTLE FAITH

AND DO NOT SEEK WHAT YOU ARE TO EAT AND WHAT YOU ARE TO DRINK NOR BE WORRIED

FOR ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD SEEK AFTER THESE THINGS AND YOUR FATHER KNOWS THAT YOU NEED THEM

INSTEAD SEEK HIS KINGDOM AND THESE THINGS WILL BE ADDED TO YOU

FEAR NOT LITTLE FLOCK FOR IT IS YOUR FATHER'S GOOD PLEASURE TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM

SELL YOUR POSSESSIONS AND GIVE TO THE NEEDY

PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH MONEYBAGS THAT DO NOT GROW OLD WITH A TREASURE IN THE HEAVENS THAT DOES NOT FAIL WHERE NO THIEF APPROACHES AND NO MOTH DESTROYS

FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO

STAY DRESSED FOR ACTION AND KEEP YOUR LAMPS BURNING AND BE LIKE MEN WHO ARE WAITING FOR THEIR MASTER TO COME HOME FROM THE WEDDING FEAST SO THAT THEY MAY OPEN THE DOOR TO HIM AT ONCE WHEN HE COMES AND KNOCKS

BLESSED ARE THOSE SERVANTS WHOM THE MASTER FINDS AWAKE WHEN HE COMES

TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE WILL DRESS HIMSELF FOR SERVICE AND HAVE THEM RECLINE AT TABLE AND HE WILL COME AND SERVE THEM

IF HE COMES IN THE SECOND WATCH OR IN THE THIRD AND FINDS THEM AWAKE BLESSED ARE THOSE SERVANTS

BUT KNOW THIS THAT IF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAD KNOWN AT WHAT HOUR THE THIEF WAS COMING HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIS HOUSE TO BE BROKEN INTO

YOU ALSO MUST BE READY FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COMING AT AN HOUR YOU DO NOT EXPECT

 PETER SAID LORD ARE YOU TELLING THIS PARABLE FOR US OR FOR ALL

 AND THE LORD SAID WHO THEN IS THE FAITHFUL AND WISE MANAGER WHOM HIS MASTER WILL SET OVER HIS HOUSEHOLD TO GIVE THEM THEIR PORTION OF FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME

BLESSED IS THAT SERVANT WHOM HIS MASTER WILL FIND SO DOING WHEN HE COMES

TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE WILL SET HIM OVER ALL HIS POSSESSIONS

BUT IF THAT SERVANT SAYS TO HIMSELF 'MY MASTER IS DELAYED IN COMING' AND BEGINS TO BEAT THE MALE AND FEMALE SERVANTS AND TO EAT AND DRINK AND GET DRUNK THE MASTER OF THAT SERVANT WILL COME ON A DAY WHEN HE DOES NOT EXPECT HIM AND AT AN HOUR HE DOES NOT KNOW AND WILL CUT HIM IN PIECES AND PUT HIM WITH THE UNFAITHFUL

AND THAT SERVANT WHO KNEW HIS MASTER'S WILL BUT DID NOT GET READY OR ACT ACCORDING TO HIS WILL WILL RECEIVE A SEVERE BEATING

BUT THE ONE WHO DID NOT KNOW AND DID WHAT DESERVED A BEATING WILL RECEIVE A LIGHT BEATING

EVERYONE TO WHOM MUCH WAS GIVEN OF HIM MUCH WILL BE REQUIRED AND FROM HIM TO WHOM THEY ENTRUSTED MUCH THEY WILL DEMAND THE MORE

I CAME TO CAST FIRE ON THE EARTH AND WOULD THAT IT WERE ALREADY KINDLED

I HAVE A BAPTISM TO BE BAPTIZED WITH AND HOW GREAT IS MY DISTRESS UNTIL IT IS ACCOMPLISHED

DO YOU THINK THAT I HAVE COME TO GIVE PEACE ON EARTH

NO I TELL YOU BUT RATHER DIVISION

FOR FROM NOW ON IN ONE HOUSE THERE WILL BE FIVE DIVIDED THREE AGAINST TWO AND TWO AGAINST THREE

THEY WILL BE DIVIDED FATHER AGAINST SON AND SON AGAINST FATHER MOTHER AGAINST DAUGHTER AND DAUGHTER AGAINST MOTHER MOTHERINLAW AGAINST HER DAUGHTERINLAW AND DAUGHTERINLAW AGAINST MOTHERINLAW

 HE ALSO SAID TO THE CROWDS WHEN YOU SEE A CLOUD RISING IN THE WEST YOU SAY AT ONCE 'A SHOWER IS COMING

' AND SO IT HAPPENS

AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SOUTH WIND BLOWING YOU SAY 'THERE WILL BE SCORCHING HEAT' AND IT HAPPENS

YOU HYPOCRITES

YOU KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THE APPEARANCE OF EARTH AND SKY BUT WHY DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THE PRESENT TIME

AND WHY DO YOU NOT JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT IS RIGHT

AS YOU GO WITH YOUR ACCUSER BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE MAKE AN EFFORT TO SETTLE WITH HIM ON THE WAY LEST HE DRAG YOU TO THE JUDGE AND THE JUDGE HAND YOU OVER TO THE OFFICER AND THE OFFICER PUT YOU IN PRISON

I TELL YOU YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID THE VERY LAST PENNY

THERE WERE SOME PRESENT AT THAT VERY TIME WHO TOLD HIM ABOUT THE GALILEANS WHOSE BLOOD PILATE HAD MINGLED WITH THEIR SACRIFICES

AND HE ANSWERED THEM DO YOU THINK THAT THESE GALILEANS WERE WORSE SINNERS THAN ALL THE OTHER GALILEANS BECAUSE THEY SUFFERED IN THIS WAY

NO I TELL YOU; BUT UNLESS YOU REPENT YOU WILL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH

OR THOSE EIGHTEEN ON WHOM THE TOWER IN SILOAM FELL AND KILLED THEM DO YOU THINK THAT THEY WERE WORSE OFFENDERS THAN ALL THE OTHERS WHO LIVED IN JERUSALEM

NO I TELL YOU; BUT UNLESS YOU REPENT YOU WILL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH

 AND HE TOLD THIS PARABLE A MAN HAD A FIG TREE PLANTED IN HIS VINEYARD AND HE CAME SEEKING FRUIT ON IT AND FOUND NONE

AND HE SAID TO THE VINEDRESSER 'LOOK FOR THREE YEARS NOW I HAVE COME SEEKING FRUIT ON THIS FIG TREE AND I FIND NONE

CUT IT DOWN

WHY SHOULD IT USE UP THE GROUND

' AND HE ANSWERED HIM 'SIR LET IT ALONE THIS YEAR ALSO UNTIL I DIG AROUND IT AND PUT ON MANURE

THEN IF IT SHOULD BEAR FRUIT NEXT YEAR WELL AND GOOD; BUT IF NOT YOU CAN CUT IT DOWN

' NOW HE WAS TEACHING IN ONE OF THE SYNAGOGUES ON THE SABBATH

AND THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD A DISABLING SPIRIT FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS

SHE WAS BENT OVER AND COULD NOT FULLY STRAIGHTEN HERSELF

WHEN JESUS SAW HER HE CALLED HER OVER AND SAID TO HER WOMAN YOU ARE FREED FROM YOUR DISABILITY

 AND HE LAID HIS HANDS ON HER AND IMMEDIATELY SHE WAS MADE STRAIGHT AND SHE GLORIFIED GOD

BUT THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE INDIGNANT BECAUSE JESUS HAD HEALED ON THE SABBATH SAID TO THE PEOPLE THERE ARE SIX DAYS IN WHICH WORK OUGHT TO BE DONE

COME ON THOSE DAYS AND BE HEALED AND NOT ON THE SABBATH DAY

 THEN THE LORD ANSWERED HIM YOU HYPOCRITES

DOES NOT EACH OF YOU ON THE SABBATH UNTIE HIS OX OR HIS DONKEY FROM THE MANGER AND LEAD IT AWAY TO WATER IT

AND OUGHT NOT THIS WOMAN A DAUGHTER OF ABRAHAM WHOM SATAN BOUND FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS BE LOOSED FROM THIS BOND ON THE SABBATH DAY

 AS HE SAID THESE THINGS ALL HIS ADVERSARIES WERE PUT TO SHAME AND ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED AT ALL THE GLORIOUS THINGS THAT WERE DONE BY HIM

HE SAID THEREFORE WHAT IS THE KINGDOM OF GOD LIKE

AND TO WHAT SHALL I COMPARE IT

IT IS LIKE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED THAT A MAN TOOK AND SOWED IN HIS GARDEN AND IT GREW AND BECAME A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR MADE NESTS IN ITS BRANCHES

 AND AGAIN HE SAID TO WHAT SHALL I COMPARE THE KINGDOM OF GOD

IT IS LIKE LEAVEN THAT A WOMAN TOOK AND HID IN THREE MEASURES OF FLOUR UNTIL IT WAS ALL LEAVENED

 HE WENT ON HIS WAY THROUGH TOWNS AND VILLAGES TEACHING AND JOURNEYING TOWARD JERUSALEM

AND SOMEONE SAID TO HIM LORD WILL THOSE WHO ARE SAVED BE FEW

 AND HE SAID TO THEM STRIVE TO ENTER THROUGH THE NARROW DOOR

FOR MANY I TELL YOU WILL SEEK TO ENTER AND WILL NOT BE ABLE

WHEN ONCE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAS RISEN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND YOU BEGIN TO STAND OUTSIDE AND TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR SAYING 'LORD OPEN TO US' THEN HE WILL ANSWER YOU 'I DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM

' THEN YOU WILL BEGIN TO SAY 'WE ATE AND DRANK IN YOUR PRESENCE AND YOU TAUGHT IN OUR STREETS

' BUT HE WILL SAY 'I TELL YOU I DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM

DEPART FROM ME ALL YOU WORKERS OF EVIL

' IN THAT PLACE THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH WHEN YOU SEE ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB AND ALL THE PROPHETS IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD BUT YOU YOURSELVES CAST OUT

AND PEOPLE WILL COME FROM EAST AND WEST AND FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND RECLINE AT TABLE IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AND BEHOLD SOME ARE LAST WHO WILL BE FIRST AND SOME ARE FIRST WHO WILL BE LAST

 AT THAT VERY HOUR SOME PHARISEES CAME AND SAID TO HIM GET AWAY FROM HERE FOR HEROD WANTS TO KILL YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM GO AND TELL THAT FOX 'BEHOLD I CAST OUT DEMONS AND PERFORM CURES TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THE THIRD DAY I FINISH MY COURSE

NEVERTHELESS I MUST GO ON MY WAY TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THE DAY FOLLOWING FOR IT CANNOT BE THAT A PROPHET SHOULD PERISH AWAY FROM JERUSALEM

' O JERUSALEM JERUSALEM THE CITY THAT KILLS THE PROPHETS AND STONES THOSE WHO ARE SENT TO IT

HOW OFTEN WOULD I HAVE GATHERED YOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER AS A HEN GATHERS HER BROOD UNDER HER WINGS AND YOU WOULD NOT

BEHOLD YOUR HOUSE IS FORSAKEN

AND I TELL YOU YOU WILL NOT SEE ME UNTIL YOU SAY 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

'ONE SABBATH WHEN HE WENT TO DINE AT THE HOUSE OF A RULER OF THE PHARISEES THEY WERE WATCHING HIM CAREFULLY

AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A MAN BEFORE HIM WHO HAD DROPSY

AND JESUS RESPONDED TO THE LAWYERS AND PHARISEES SAYING IS IT LAWFUL TO HEAL ON THE SABBATH OR NOT

 BUT THEY REMAINED SILENT

THEN HE TOOK HIM AND HEALED HIM AND SENT HIM AWAY

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHICH OF YOU HAVING A SON OR AN OX THAT HAS FALLEN INTO A WELL ON A SABBATH DAY WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY PULL HIM OUT

 AND THEY COULD NOT REPLY TO THESE THINGS

NOW HE TOLD A PARABLE TO THOSE WHO WERE INVITED WHEN HE NOTICED HOW THEY CHOSE THE PLACES OF HONOR SAYING TO THEM WHEN YOU ARE INVITED BY SOMEONE TO A WEDDING FEAST DO NOT SIT DOWN IN A PLACE OF HONOR LEST SOMEONE MORE DISTINGUISHED THAN YOU BE INVITED BY HIM AND HE WHO INVITED YOU BOTH WILL COME AND SAY TO YOU 'GIVE YOUR PLACE TO THIS PERSON' AND THEN YOU WILL BEGIN WITH SHAME TO TAKE THE LOWEST PLACE

BUT WHEN YOU ARE INVITED GO AND SIT IN THE LOWEST PLACE SO THAT WHEN YOUR HOST COMES HE MAY SAY TO YOU 'FRIEND MOVE UP HIGHER

' THEN YOU WILL BE HONORED IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL WHO SIT AT TABLE WITH YOU

FOR EVERYONE WHO EXALTS HIMSELF WILL BE HUMBLED AND HE WHO HUMBLES HIMSELF WILL BE EXALTED

 HE SAID ALSO TO THE MAN WHO HAD INVITED HIM WHEN YOU GIVE A DINNER OR A BANQUET DO NOT INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OR YOUR BROTHERS OR YOUR RELATIVES OR RICH NEIGHBORS LEST THEY ALSO INVITE YOU IN RETURN AND YOU BE REPAID

BUT WHEN YOU GIVE A FEAST INVITE THE POOR THE CRIPPLED THE LAME THE BLIND AND YOU WILL BE BLESSED BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REPAY YOU

YOU WILL BE REPAID AT THE RESURRECTION OF THE JUST

 WHEN ONE OF THOSE WHO RECLINED AT TABLE WITH HIM HEARD THESE THINGS HE SAID TO HIM BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO WILL EAT BREAD IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 BUT HE SAID TO HIM A MAN ONCE GAVE A GREAT BANQUET AND INVITED MANY

AND AT THE TIME FOR THE BANQUET HE SENT HIS SERVANT TO SAY TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INVITED 'COME FOR EVERYTHING IS NOW READY

' BUT THEY ALL ALIKE BEGAN TO MAKE EXCUSES

THE FIRST SAID TO HIM 'I HAVE BOUGHT A FIELD AND I MUST GO OUT AND SEE IT

PLEASE HAVE ME EXCUSED

' AND ANOTHER SAID 'I HAVE BOUGHT FIVE YOKE OF OXEN AND I GO TO EXAMINE THEM

PLEASE HAVE ME EXCUSED

' AND ANOTHER SAID 'I HAVE MARRIED A WIFE AND THEREFORE I CANNOT COME

' SO THE SERVANT CAME AND REPORTED THESE THINGS TO HIS MASTER

THEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BECAME ANGRY AND SAID TO HIS SERVANT 'GO OUT QUICKLY TO THE STREETS AND LANES OF THE CITY AND BRING IN THE POOR AND CRIPPLED AND BLIND AND LAME

' AND THE SERVANT SAID 'SIR WHAT YOU COMMANDED HAS BEEN DONE AND STILL THERE IS ROOM

' AND THE MASTER SAID TO THE SERVANT 'GO OUT TO THE HIGHWAYS AND HEDGES AND COMPEL PEOPLE TO COME IN THAT MY HOUSE MAY BE FILLED

FOR I TELL YOU NONE OF THOSE MEN WHO WERE INVITED SHALL TASTE MY BANQUET

' NOW GREAT CROWDS ACCOMPANIED HIM AND HE TURNED AND SAID TO THEM IF ANYONE COMES TO ME AND DOES NOT HATE HIS OWN FATHER AND MOTHER AND WIFE AND CHILDREN AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YES AND EVEN HIS OWN LIFE HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE

WHOEVER DOES NOT BEAR HIS OWN CROSS AND COME AFTER ME CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE

FOR WHICH OF YOU DESIRING TO BUILD A TOWER DOES NOT FIRST SIT DOWN AND COUNT THE COST WHETHER HE HAS ENOUGH TO COMPLETE IT

OTHERWISE WHEN HE HAS LAID A FOUNDATION AND IS NOT ABLE TO FINISH ALL WHO SEE IT BEGIN TO MOCK HIM SAYING 'THIS MAN BEGAN TO BUILD AND WAS NOT ABLE TO FINISH

' OR WHAT KING GOING OUT TO ENCOUNTER ANOTHER KING IN WAR WILL NOT SIT DOWN FIRST AND DELIBERATE WHETHER HE IS ABLE WITH TEN THOUSAND TO MEET HIM WHO COMES AGAINST HIM WITH TWENTY THOUSAND

AND IF NOT WHILE THE OTHER IS YET A GREAT WAY OFF HE SENDS A DELEGATION AND ASKS FOR TERMS OF PEACE

SO THEREFORE ANY ONE OF YOU WHO DOES NOT RENOUNCE ALL THAT HE HAS CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE

SALT IS GOOD BUT IF SALT HAS LOST ITS TASTE HOW SHALL ITS SALTINESS BE RESTORED

IT IS OF NO USE EITHER FOR THE SOIL OR FOR THE MANURE PILE

IT IS THROWN AWAY

HE WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR LET HIM HEAR

NOW THE TAX COLLECTORS AND SINNERS WERE ALL DRAWING NEAR TO HEAR HIM

AND THE PHARISEES AND THE SCRIBES GRUMBLED SAYING THIS MAN RECEIVES SINNERS AND EATS WITH THEM

 SO HE TOLD THEM THIS PARABLE WHAT MAN OF YOU HAVING A HUNDRED SHEEP IF HE HAS LOST ONE OF THEM DOES NOT LEAVE THE NINETYNINE IN THE OPEN COUNTRY AND GO AFTER THE ONE THAT IS LOST UNTIL HE FINDS IT

AND WHEN HE HAS FOUND IT HE LAYS IT ON HIS SHOULDERS REJOICING

AND WHEN HE COMES HOME HE CALLS TOGETHER HIS FRIENDS AND HIS NEIGHBORS SAYING TO THEM 'REJOICE WITH ME FOR I HAVE FOUND MY SHEEP THAT WAS LOST

' JUST SO I TELL YOU THERE WILL BE MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER WHO REPENTS THAN OVER NINETYNINE RIGHTEOUS PERSONS WHO NEED NO REPENTANCE

OR WHAT WOMAN HAVING TEN SILVER COINS IF SHE LOSES ONE COIN DOES NOT LIGHT A LAMP AND SWEEP THE HOUSE AND SEEK DILIGENTLY UNTIL SHE FINDS IT

AND WHEN SHE HAS FOUND IT SHE CALLS TOGETHER HER FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS SAYING 'REJOICE WITH ME FOR I HAVE FOUND THE COIN THAT I HAD LOST

' JUST SO I TELL YOU THERE IS JOY BEFORE THE ANGELS OF GOD OVER ONE SINNER WHO REPENTS

 AND HE SAID THERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD TWO SONS

AND THE YOUNGER OF THEM SAID TO HIS FATHER 'FATHER GIVE ME THE SHARE OF PROPERTY THAT IS COMING TO ME

' AND HE DIVIDED HIS PROPERTY BETWEEN THEM

NOT MANY DAYS LATER THE YOUNGER SON GATHERED ALL HE HAD AND TOOK A JOURNEY INTO A FAR COUNTRY AND THERE HE SQUANDERED HIS PROPERTY IN RECKLESS LIVING

AND WHEN HE HAD SPENT EVERYTHING A SEVERE FAMINE AROSE IN THAT COUNTRY AND HE BEGAN TO BE IN NEED

SO HE WENT AND HIRED HIMSELF OUT TO ONE OF THE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY WHO SENT HIM INTO HIS FIELDS TO FEED PIGS

AND HE WAS LONGING TO BE FED WITH THE PODS THAT THE PIGS ATE AND NO ONE GAVE HIM ANYTHING

BUT WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE SAID 'HOW MANY OF MY FATHER'S HIRED SERVANTS HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH BREAD BUT I PERISH HERE WITH HUNGER

I WILL ARISE AND GO TO MY FATHER AND I WILL SAY TO HIM FATHER I HAVE SINNED AGAINST HEAVEN AND BEFORE YOU

I AM NO LONGER WORTHY TO BE CALLED YOUR SON

TREAT ME AS ONE OF YOUR HIRED SERVANTS

' AND HE AROSE AND CAME TO HIS FATHER

BUT WHILE HE WAS STILL A LONG WAY OFF HIS FATHER SAW HIM AND FELT COMPASSION AND RAN AND EMBRACED HIM AND KISSED HIM

AND THE SON SAID TO HIM 'FATHER I HAVE SINNED AGAINST HEAVEN AND BEFORE YOU

I AM NO LONGER WORTHY TO BE CALLED YOUR SON

' BUT THE FATHER SAID TO HIS SERVANTS 'BRING QUICKLY THE BEST ROBE AND PUT IT ON HIM AND PUT A RING ON HIS HAND AND SHOES ON HIS FEET

AND BRING THE FATTENED CALF AND KILL IT AND LET US EAT AND CELEBRATE

FOR THIS MY SON WAS DEAD AND IS ALIVE AGAIN; HE WAS LOST AND IS FOUND

' AND THEY BEGAN TO CELEBRATE

NOW HIS OLDER SON WAS IN THE FIELD AND AS HE CAME AND DREW NEAR TO THE HOUSE HE HEARD MUSIC AND DANCING

AND HE CALLED ONE OF THE SERVANTS AND ASKED WHAT THESE THINGS MEANT

AND HE SAID TO HIM 'YOUR BROTHER HAS COME AND YOUR FATHER HAS KILLED THE FATTENED CALF BECAUSE HE HAS RECEIVED HIM BACK SAFE AND SOUND

' BUT HE WAS ANGRY AND REFUSED TO GO IN

HIS FATHER CAME OUT AND ENTREATED HIM BUT HE ANSWERED HIS FATHER 'LOOK THESE MANY YEARS I HAVE SERVED YOU AND I NEVER DISOBEYED YOUR COMMAND YET YOU NEVER GAVE ME A YOUNG GOAT THAT I MIGHT CELEBRATE WITH MY FRIENDS

BUT WHEN THIS SON OF YOURS CAME WHO HAS DEVOURED YOUR PROPERTY WITH PROSTITUTES YOU KILLED THE FATTENED CALF FOR HIM

' AND HE SAID TO HIM 'SON YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH ME AND ALL THAT IS MINE IS YOURS

IT WAS FITTING TO CELEBRATE AND BE GLAD FOR THIS YOUR BROTHER WAS DEAD AND IS ALIVE; HE WAS LOST AND IS FOUND

'HE ALSO SAID TO THE DISCIPLES THERE WAS A RICH MAN WHO HAD A MANAGER AND CHARGES WERE BROUGHT TO HIM THAT THIS MAN WAS WASTING HIS POSSESSIONS

AND HE CALLED HIM AND SAID TO HIM 'WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR ABOUT YOU

TURN IN THE ACCOUNT OF YOUR MANAGEMENT FOR YOU CAN NO LONGER BE MANAGER

' AND THE MANAGER SAID TO HIMSELF 'WHAT SHALL I DO SINCE MY MASTER IS TAKING THE MANAGEMENT AWAY FROM ME

I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DIG AND I AM ASHAMED TO BEG

I HAVE DECIDED WHAT TO DO SO THAT WHEN I AM REMOVED FROM MANAGEMENT PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE ME INTO THEIR HOUSES

' SO SUMMONING HIS MASTER'S DEBTORS ONE BY ONE HE SAID TO THE FIRST 'HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE MY MASTER

' HE SAID 'A HUNDRED MEASURES OF OIL

' HE SAID TO HIM 'TAKE YOUR BILL AND SIT DOWN QUICKLY AND WRITE FIFTY

' THEN HE SAID TO ANOTHER 'AND HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE

' HE SAID 'A HUNDRED MEASURES OF WHEAT

' HE SAID TO HIM 'TAKE YOUR BILL AND WRITE EIGHTY

' THE MASTER COMMENDED THE DISHONEST MANAGER FOR HIS SHREWDNESS

FOR THE SONS OF THIS WORLD ARE MORE SHREWD IN DEALING WITH THEIR OWN GENERATION THAN THE SONS OF LIGHT

AND I TELL YOU MAKE FRIENDS FOR YOURSELVES BY MEANS OF UNRIGHTEOUS WEALTH SO THAT WHEN IT FAILS THEY MAY RECEIVE YOU INTO THE ETERNAL DWELLINGS

ONE WHO IS FAITHFUL IN A VERY LITTLE IS ALSO FAITHFUL IN MUCH AND ONE WHO IS DISHONEST IN A VERY LITTLE IS ALSO DISHONEST IN MUCH

IF THEN YOU HAVE NOT BEEN FAITHFUL IN THE UNRIGHTEOUS WEALTH WHO WILL ENTRUST TO YOU THE TRUE RICHES

AND IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN FAITHFUL IN THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER'S WHO WILL GIVE YOU THAT WHICH IS YOUR OWN

NO SERVANT CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS FOR EITHER HE WILL HATE THE ONE AND LOVE THE OTHER OR HE WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE ONE AND DESPISE THE OTHER

YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MONEY

 THE PHARISEES WHO WERE LOVERS OF MONEY HEARD ALL THESE THINGS AND THEY RIDICULED HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU ARE THOSE WHO JUSTIFY YOURSELVES BEFORE MEN BUT GOD KNOWS YOUR HEARTS

FOR WHAT IS EXALTED AMONG MEN IS AN ABOMINATION IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS WERE UNTIL JOHN; SINCE THEN THE GOOD NEWS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS PREACHED AND EVERYONE FORCES HIS WAY INTO IT

BUT IT IS EASIER FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PASS AWAY THAN FOR ONE DOT OF THE LAW TO BECOME VOID

EVERYONE WHO DIVORCES HIS WIFE AND MARRIES ANOTHER COMMITS ADULTERY AND HE WHO MARRIES A WOMAN DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND COMMITS ADULTERY

THERE WAS A RICH MAN WHO WAS CLOTHED IN PURPLE AND FINE LINEN AND WHO FEASTED SUMPTUOUSLY EVERY DAY

AND AT HIS GATE WAS LAID A POOR MAN NAMED LAZARUS COVERED WITH SORES WHO DESIRED TO BE FED WITH WHAT FELL FROM THE RICH MAN'S TABLE

MOREOVER EVEN THE DOGS CAME AND LICKED HIS SORES

THE POOR MAN DIED AND WAS CARRIED BY THE ANGELS TO ABRAHAM'S SIDE

THE RICH MAN ALSO DIED AND WAS BURIED AND IN HADES BEING IN TORMENT HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW ABRAHAM FAR OFF AND LAZARUS AT HIS SIDE

AND HE CALLED OUT 'FATHER ABRAHAM HAVE MERCY ON ME AND SEND LAZARUS TO DIP THE END OF HIS FINGER IN WATER AND COOL MY TONGUE FOR I AM IN ANGUISH IN THIS FLAME

' BUT ABRAHAM SAID 'CHILD REMEMBER THAT YOU IN YOUR LIFETIME RECEIVED YOUR GOOD THINGS AND LAZARUS IN LIKE MANNER BAD THINGS; BUT NOW HE IS COMFORTED HERE AND YOU ARE IN ANGUISH

AND BESIDES ALL THIS BETWEEN US AND YOU A GREAT CHASM HAS BEEN FIXED IN ORDER THAT THOSE WHO WOULD PASS FROM HERE TO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE AND NONE MAY CROSS FROM THERE TO US

' AND HE SAID 'THEN I BEG YOU FATHER TO SEND HIM TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE FOR I HAVE FIVE BROTHERSSO THAT HE MAY WARN THEM LEST THEY ALSO COME INTO THIS PLACE OF TORMENT

' BUT ABRAHAM SAID 'THEY HAVE MOSES AND THE PROPHETS; LET THEM HEAR THEM

' AND HE SAID 'NO FATHER ABRAHAM BUT IF SOMEONE GOES TO THEM FROM THE DEAD THEY WILL REPENT

' HE SAID TO HIM 'IF THEY DO NOT HEAR MOSES AND THE PROPHETS NEITHER WILL THEY BE CONVINCED IF SOMEONE SHOULD RISE FROM THE DEAD

'AND HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES TEMPTATIONS TO SIN ARE SURE TO COME BUT WOE TO THE ONE THROUGH WHOM THEY COME

IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM IF A MILLSTONE WERE HUNG AROUND HIS NECK AND HE WERE CAST INTO THE SEA THAN THAT HE SHOULD CAUSE ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES TO SIN

PAY ATTENTION TO YOURSELVES

IF YOUR BROTHER SINS REBUKE HIM AND IF HE REPENTS FORGIVE HIM AND IF HE SINS AGAINST YOU SEVEN TIMES IN THE DAY AND TURNS TO YOU SEVEN TIMES SAYING 'I REPENT' YOU MUST FORGIVE HIM

 THE APOSTLES SAID TO THE LORD INCREASE OUR FAITH

 AND THE LORD SAID IF YOU HAD FAITH LIKE A GRAIN OF MUSTARD SEED YOU COULD SAY TO THIS MULBERRY TREE 'BE UPROOTED AND PLANTED IN THE SEA' AND IT WOULD OBEY YOU

WILL ANY ONE OF YOU WHO HAS A SERVANT PLOWING OR KEEPING SHEEP SAY TO HIM WHEN HE HAS COME IN FROM THE FIELD 'COME AT ONCE AND RECLINE AT TABLE'

WILL HE NOT RATHER SAY TO HIM 'PREPARE SUPPER FOR ME AND DRESS PROPERLY AND SERVE ME WHILE I EAT AND DRINK AND AFTERWARD YOU WILL EAT AND DRINK'

DOES HE THANK THE SERVANT BECAUSE HE DID WHAT WAS COMMANDED

SO YOU ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE DONE ALL THAT YOU WERE COMMANDED SAY 'WE ARE UNWORTHY SERVANTS; WE HAVE ONLY DONE WHAT WAS OUR DUTY

' ON THE WAY TO JERUSALEM HE WAS PASSING ALONG BETWEEN SAMARIA AND GALILEE

AND AS HE ENTERED A VILLAGE HE WAS MET BY TEN LEPERS WHO STOOD AT A DISTANCE AND LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES SAYING JESUS MASTER HAVE MERCY ON US

 WHEN HE SAW THEM HE SAID TO THEM GO AND SHOW YOURSELVES TO THE PRIESTS

 AND AS THEY WENT THEY WERE CLEANSED

THEN ONE OF THEM WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS HEALED TURNED BACK PRAISING GOD WITH A LOUD VOICE; AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE AT JESUS' FEET GIVING HIM THANKS

NOW HE WAS A SAMARITAN

THEN JESUS ANSWERED WERE NOT TEN CLEANSED

WHERE ARE THE NINE

WAS NO ONE FOUND TO RETURN AND GIVE PRAISE TO GOD EXCEPT THIS FOREIGNER

 AND HE SAID TO HIM RISE AND GO YOUR WAY; YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL

 BEING ASKED BY THE PHARISEES WHEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD WOULD COME HE ANSWERED THEM THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT COMING WITH SIGNS TO BE OBSERVED NOR WILL THEY SAY 'LOOK HERE IT IS

' OR 'THERE

' FOR BEHOLD THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS IN THE MIDST OF YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THE DISCIPLES THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN YOU WILL DESIRE TO SEE ONE OF THE DAYS OF THE SON OF MAN AND YOU WILL NOT SEE IT

AND THEY WILL SAY TO YOU 'LOOK THERE

' OR 'LOOK HERE

' DO NOT GO OUT OR FOLLOW THEM

FOR AS THE LIGHTNING FLASHES AND LIGHTS UP THE SKY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SO WILL THE SON OF MAN BE IN HIS DAY

BUT FIRST HE MUST SUFFER MANY THINGS AND BE REJECTED BY THIS GENERATION

JUST AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH SO WILL IT BE IN THE DAYS OF THE SON OF MAN

THEY WERE EATING AND DRINKING AND MARRYING AND BEING GIVEN IN MARRIAGE UNTIL THE DAY WHEN NOAH ENTERED THE ARK AND THE FLOOD CAME AND DESTROYED THEM ALL

LIKEWISE JUST AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOTTHEY WERE EATING AND DRINKING BUYING AND SELLING PLANTING AND BUILDING BUT ON THE DAY WHEN LOT WENT OUT FROM SODOM FIRE AND SULFUR RAINED FROM HEAVEN AND DESTROYED THEM ALL SO WILL IT BE ON THE DAY WHEN THE SON OF MAN IS REVEALED

ON THAT DAY LET THE ONE WHO IS ON THE HOUSETOP WITH HIS GOODS IN THE HOUSE NOT COME DOWN TO TAKE THEM AWAY AND LIKEWISE LET THE ONE WHO IS IN THE FIELD NOT TURN BACK

REMEMBER LOT'S WIFE

WHOEVER SEEKS TO PRESERVE HIS LIFE WILL LOSE IT BUT WHOEVER LOSES HIS LIFE WILL KEEP IT

I TELL YOU IN THAT NIGHT THERE WILL BE TWO IN ONE BED

ONE WILL BE TAKEN AND THE OTHER LEFT

THERE WILL BE TWO WOMEN GRINDING TOGETHER

ONE WILL BE TAKEN AND THE OTHER LEFT

 SEE FOOTNOTE AND THEY SAID TO HIM WHERE LORD

 HE SAID TO THEM WHERE THE CORPSE IS THERE THE VULTURES WILL GATHER

AND HE TOLD THEM A PARABLE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRAY AND NOT LOSE HEART

HE SAID IN A CERTAIN CITY THERE WAS A JUDGE WHO NEITHER FEARED GOD NOR RESPECTED MAN

AND THERE WAS A WIDOW IN THAT CITY WHO KEPT COMING TO HIM AND SAYING 'GIVE ME JUSTICE AGAINST MY ADVERSARY

' FOR A WHILE HE REFUSED BUT AFTERWARD HE SAID TO HIMSELF 'THOUGH I NEITHER FEAR GOD NOR RESPECT MAN YET BECAUSE THIS WIDOW KEEPS BOTHERING ME I WILL GIVE HER JUSTICE SO THAT SHE WILL NOT BEAT ME DOWN BY HER CONTINUAL COMING

' AND THE LORD SAID HEAR WHAT THE UNRIGHTEOUS JUDGE SAYS

AND WILL NOT GOD GIVE JUSTICE TO HIS ELECT WHO CRY TO HIM DAY AND NIGHT

WILL HE DELAY LONG OVER THEM

I TELL YOU HE WILL GIVE JUSTICE TO THEM SPEEDILY

NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE SON OF MAN COMES WILL HE FIND FAITH ON EARTH

 HE ALSO TOLD THIS PARABLE TO SOME WHO TRUSTED IN THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE RIGHTEOUS AND TREATED OTHERS WITH CONTEMPT TWO MEN WENT UP INTO THE TEMPLE TO PRAY ONE A PHARISEE AND THE OTHER A TAX COLLECTOR

THE PHARISEE STANDING BY HIMSELF PRAYED THUS 'GOD I THANK YOU THAT I AM NOT LIKE OTHER MEN EXTORTIONERS UNJUST ADULTERERS OR EVEN LIKE THIS TAX COLLECTOR

I FAST TWICE A WEEK; I GIVE TITHES OF ALL THAT I GET

' BUT THE TAX COLLECTOR STANDING FAR OFF WOULD NOT EVEN LIFT UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN BUT BEAT HIS BREAST SAYING 'GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER

' I TELL YOU THIS MAN WENT DOWN TO HIS HOUSE JUSTIFIED RATHER THAN THE OTHER

FOR EVERYONE WHO EXALTS HIMSELF WILL BE HUMBLED BUT THE ONE WHO HUMBLES HIMSELF WILL BE EXALTED

 NOW THEY WERE BRINGING EVEN INFANTS TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT TOUCH THEM

AND WHEN THE DISCIPLES SAW IT THEY REBUKED THEM

BUT JESUS CALLED THEM TO HIM SAYING LET THE CHILDREN COME TO ME AND DO NOT HINDER THEM FOR TO SUCH BELONGS THE KINGDOM OF GOD

TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER DOES NOT RECEIVE THE KINGDOM OF GOD LIKE A CHILD SHALL NOT ENTER IT

 AND A RULER ASKED HIM GOOD TEACHER WHAT MUST I DO TO INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU CALL ME GOOD

NO ONE IS GOOD EXCEPT GOD ALONE

YOU KNOW THE COMMANDMENTS 'DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY DO NOT MURDER DO NOT STEAL DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER

' AND HE SAID ALL THESE I HAVE KEPT FROM MY YOUTH

 WHEN JESUS HEARD THIS HE SAID TO HIM ONE THING YOU STILL LACK

SELL ALL THAT YOU HAVE AND DISTRIBUTE TO THE POOR AND YOU WILL HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN; AND COME FOLLOW ME

 BUT WHEN HE HEARD THESE THINGS HE BECAME VERY SAD FOR HE WAS EXTREMELY RICH

JESUS LOOKING AT HIM WITH SADNESS SAID HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WEALTH TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

FOR IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO GO THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN FOR A RICH PERSON TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 THOSE WHO HEARD IT SAID THEN WHO CAN BE SAVED

 BUT HE SAID WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN IS POSSIBLE WITH GOD

 AND PETER SAID SEE WE HAVE LEFT OUR HOMES AND FOLLOWED YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM TRULY I SAY TO YOU THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS LEFT HOUSE OR WIFE OR BROTHERS OR PARENTS OR CHILDREN FOR THE SAKE OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHO WILL NOT RECEIVE MANY TIMES MORE IN THIS TIME AND IN THE AGE TO COME ETERNAL LIFE

 AND TAKING THE TWELVE HE SAID TO THEM SEE WE ARE GOING UP TO JERUSALEM AND EVERYTHING THAT IS WRITTEN ABOUT THE SON OF MAN BY THE PROPHETS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED

FOR HE WILL BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GENTILES AND WILL BE MOCKED AND SHAMEFULLY TREATED AND SPIT UPON

AND AFTER FLOGGING HIM THEY WILL KILL HIM AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE WILL RISE

 BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD NONE OF THESE THINGS

THIS SAYING WAS HIDDEN FROM THEM AND THEY DID NOT GRASP WHAT WAS SAID

AS HE DREW NEAR TO JERICHO A BLIND MAN WAS SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE BEGGING

AND HEARING A CROWD GOING BY HE INQUIRED WHAT THIS MEANT

THEY TOLD HIM JESUS OF NAZARETH IS PASSING BY

 AND HE CRIED OUT JESUS SON OF DAVID HAVE MERCY ON ME

 AND THOSE WHO WERE IN FRONT REBUKED HIM TELLING HIM TO BE SILENT

BUT HE CRIED OUT ALL THE MORE SON OF DAVID HAVE MERCY ON ME

 AND JESUS STOPPED AND COMMANDED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO HIM

AND WHEN HE CAME NEAR HE ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU

 HE SAID LORD LET ME RECOVER MY SIGHT

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM RECOVER YOUR SIGHT; YOUR FAITH HAS MADE YOU WELL

 AND IMMEDIATELY HE RECOVERED HIS SIGHT AND FOLLOWED HIM GLORIFYING GOD

AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAW IT GAVE PRAISE TO GOD

HE ENTERED JERICHO AND WAS PASSING THROUGH

AND THERE WAS A MAN NAMED ZACCHAEUS

HE WAS A CHIEF TAX COLLECTOR AND WAS RICH

AND HE WAS SEEKING TO SEE WHO JESUS WAS BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THE CROWD HE COULD NOT BECAUSE HE WAS SMALL OF STATURE

SO HE RAN ON AHEAD AND CLIMBED UP INTO A SYCAMORE TREE TO SEE HIM FOR HE WAS ABOUT TO PASS THAT WAY

AND WHEN JESUS CAME TO THE PLACE HE LOOKED UP AND SAID TO HIM ZACCHAEUS HURRY AND COME DOWN FOR I MUST STAY AT YOUR HOUSE TODAY

 SO HE HURRIED AND CAME DOWN AND RECEIVED HIM JOYFULLY

AND WHEN THEY SAW IT THEY ALL GRUMBLED HE HAS GONE IN TO BE THE GUEST OF A MAN WHO IS A SINNER

 AND ZACCHAEUS STOOD AND SAID TO THE LORD BEHOLD LORD THE HALF OF MY GOODS I GIVE TO THE POOR

AND IF I HAVE DEFRAUDED ANYONE OF ANYTHING I RESTORE IT FOURFOLD

 AND JESUS SAID TO HIM TODAY SALVATION HAS COME TO THIS HOUSE SINCE HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM

FOR THE SON OF MAN CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THE LOST

 AS THEY HEARD THESE THINGS HE PROCEEDED TO TELL A PARABLE BECAUSE HE WAS NEAR TO JERUSALEM AND BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSED THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD WAS TO APPEAR IMMEDIATELY

HE SAID THEREFORE A NOBLEMAN WENT INTO A FAR COUNTRY TO RECEIVE FOR HIMSELF A KINGDOM AND THEN RETURN

CALLING TEN OF HIS SERVANTS HE GAVE THEM TEN MINAS AND SAID TO THEM 'ENGAGE IN BUSINESS UNTIL I COME

' BUT HIS CITIZENS HATED HIM AND SENT A DELEGATION AFTER HIM SAYING 'WE DO NOT WANT THIS MAN TO REIGN OVER US

' WHEN HE RETURNED HAVING RECEIVED THE KINGDOM HE ORDERED THESE SERVANTS TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN THE MONEY TO BE CALLED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD GAINED BY DOING BUSINESS

THE FIRST CAME BEFORE HIM SAYING 'LORD YOUR MINA HAS MADE TEN MINAS MORE

' AND HE SAID TO HIM 'WELL DONE GOOD SERVANT

BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL IN A VERY LITTLE YOU SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY OVER TEN CITIES

' AND THE SECOND CAME SAYING 'LORD YOUR MINA HAS MADE FIVE MINAS

' AND HE SAID TO HIM 'AND YOU ARE TO BE OVER FIVE CITIES

' THEN ANOTHER CAME SAYING 'LORD HERE IS YOUR MINA WHICH I KEPT LAID AWAY IN A HANDKERCHIEF; FOR I WAS AFRAID OF YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A SEVERE MAN

YOU TAKE WHAT YOU DID NOT DEPOSIT AND REAP WHAT YOU DID NOT SOW

' HE SAID TO HIM 'I WILL CONDEMN YOU WITH YOUR OWN WORDS YOU WICKED SERVANT

YOU KNEW THAT I WAS A SEVERE MAN TAKING WHAT I DID NOT DEPOSIT AND REAPING WHAT I DID NOT SOW

WHY THEN DID YOU NOT PUT MY MONEY IN THE BANK AND AT MY COMING I MIGHT HAVE COLLECTED IT WITH INTEREST

' AND HE SAID TO THOSE WHO STOOD BY 'TAKE THE MINA FROM HIM AND GIVE IT TO THE ONE WHO HAS THE TEN MINAS

' AND THEY SAID TO HIM 'LORD HE HAS TEN MINAS

' 'I TELL YOU THAT TO EVERYONE WHO HAS MORE WILL BE GIVEN BUT FROM THE ONE WHO HAS NOT EVEN WHAT HE HAS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY

BUT AS FOR THESE ENEMIES OF MINE WHO DID NOT WANT ME TO REIGN OVER THEM BRING THEM HERE AND SLAUGHTER THEM BEFORE ME

' AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE WENT ON AHEAD GOING UP TO JERUSALEM

WHEN HE DREW NEAR TO BETHPHAGE AND BETHANY AT THE MOUNT THAT IS CALLED OLIVET HE SENT TWO OF THE DISCIPLES SAYING GO INTO THE VILLAGE IN FRONT OF YOU WHERE ON ENTERING YOU WILL FIND A COLT TIED ON WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER YET SAT

UNTIE IT AND BRING IT HERE

IF ANYONE ASKS YOU 'WHY ARE YOU UNTYING IT

' YOU SHALL SAY THIS 'THE LORD HAS NEED OF IT

' SO THOSE WHO WERE SENT WENT AWAY AND FOUND IT JUST AS HE HAD TOLD THEM

AND AS THEY WERE UNTYING THE COLT ITS OWNERS SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU UNTYING THE COLT

 AND THEY SAID THE LORD HAS NEED OF IT

 AND THEY BROUGHT IT TO JESUS AND THROWING THEIR CLOAKS ON THE COLT THEY SET JESUS ON IT

AND AS HE RODE ALONG THEY SPREAD THEIR CLOAKS ON THE ROAD

AS HE WAS DRAWING NEARALREADY ON THE WAY DOWN THE MOUNT OF OLIVESTHE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF HIS DISCIPLES BEGAN TO REJOICE AND PRAISE GOD WITH A LOUD VOICE FOR ALL THE MIGHTY WORKS THAT THEY HAD SEEN SAYING BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

PEACE IN HEAVEN AND GLORY IN THE HIGHEST

 AND SOME OF THE PHARISEES IN THE CROWD SAID TO HIM TEACHER REBUKE YOUR DISCIPLES

 HE ANSWERED I TELL YOU IF THESE WERE SILENT THE VERY STONES WOULD CRY OUT

 AND WHEN HE DREW NEAR AND SAW THE CITY HE WEPT OVER IT SAYING WOULD THAT YOU EVEN YOU HAD KNOWN ON THIS DAY THE THINGS THAT MAKE FOR PEACE

BUT NOW THEY ARE HIDDEN FROM YOUR EYES

FOR THE DAYS WILL COME UPON YOU WHEN YOUR ENEMIES WILL SET UP A BARRICADE AROUND YOU AND SURROUND YOU AND HEM YOU IN ON EVERY SIDE AND TEAR YOU DOWN TO THE GROUND YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN WITHIN YOU

AND THEY WILL NOT LEAVE ONE STONE UPON ANOTHER IN YOU BECAUSE YOU DID NOT KNOW THE TIME OF YOUR VISITATION

 AND HE ENTERED THE TEMPLE AND BEGAN TO DRIVE OUT THOSE WHO SOLD SAYING TO THEM IT IS WRITTEN 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER' BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT A DEN OF ROBBERS

 AND HE WAS TEACHING DAILY IN THE TEMPLE

THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES AND THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE PEOPLE WERE SEEKING TO DESTROY HIM BUT THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WERE HANGING ON HIS WORDS

ONE DAY AS JESUS WAS TEACHING THE PEOPLE IN THE TEMPLE AND PREACHING THE GOSPEL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES WITH THE ELDERS CAME UP AND SAID TO HIM TELL US BY WHAT AUTHORITY YOU DO THESE THINGS OR WHO IT IS THAT GAVE YOU THIS AUTHORITY

 HE ANSWERED THEM I ALSO WILL ASK YOU A QUESTION

NOW TELL ME WAS THE BAPTISM OF JOHN FROM HEAVEN OR FROM MAN

 AND THEY DISCUSSED IT WITH ONE ANOTHER SAYING IF WE SAY 'FROM HEAVEN' HE WILL SAY 'WHY DID YOU NOT BELIEVE HIM

' BUT IF WE SAY 'FROM MAN' ALL THE PEOPLE WILL STONE US TO DEATH FOR THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT JOHN WAS A PROPHET

 SO THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM

AND JESUS SAID TO THEM NEITHER WILL I TELL YOU BY WHAT AUTHORITY I DO THESE THINGS

 AND HE BEGAN TO TELL THE PEOPLE THIS PARABLE A MAN PLANTED A VINEYARD AND LET IT OUT TO TENANTS AND WENT INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR A LONG WHILE

WHEN THE TIME CAME HE SENT A SERVANT TO THE TENANTS SO THAT THEY WOULD GIVE HIM SOME OF THE FRUIT OF THE VINEYARD

BUT THE TENANTS BEAT HIM AND SENT HIM AWAY EMPTYHANDED

AND HE SENT ANOTHER SERVANT

BUT THEY ALSO BEAT AND TREATED HIM SHAMEFULLY AND SENT HIM AWAY EMPTYHANDED

AND HE SENT YET A THIRD

THIS ONE ALSO THEY WOUNDED AND CAST OUT

THEN THE OWNER OF THE VINEYARD SAID 'WHAT SHALL I DO

I WILL SEND MY BELOVED SON; PERHAPS THEY WILL RESPECT HIM

' BUT WHEN THE TENANTS SAW HIM THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES 'THIS IS THE HEIR

LET US KILL HIM SO THAT THE INHERITANCE MAY BE OURS

' AND THEY THREW HIM OUT OF THE VINEYARD AND KILLED HIM

WHAT THEN WILL THE OWNER OF THE VINEYARD DO TO THEM

HE WILL COME AND DESTROY THOSE TENANTS AND GIVE THE VINEYARD TO OTHERS

 WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY SAID SURELY NOT

 BUT HE LOOKED DIRECTLY AT THEM AND SAID WHAT THEN IS THIS THAT IS WRITTEN 'THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE'

EVERYONE WHO FALLS ON THAT STONE WILL BE BROKEN TO PIECES AND WHEN IT FALLS ON ANYONE IT WILL CRUSH HIM

 THE SCRIBES AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS SOUGHT TO LAY HANDS ON HIM AT THAT VERY HOUR FOR THEY PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD TOLD THIS PARABLE AGAINST THEM BUT THEY FEARED THE PEOPLE

SO THEY WATCHED HIM AND SENT SPIES WHO PRETENDED TO BE SINCERE THAT THEY MIGHT CATCH HIM IN SOMETHING HE SAID SO AS TO DELIVER HIM UP TO THE AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION OF THE GOVERNOR

SO THEY ASKED HIM TEACHER WE KNOW THAT YOU SPEAK AND TEACH RIGHTLY AND SHOW NO PARTIALITY BUT TRULY TEACH THE WAY OF GOD

IS IT LAWFUL FOR US TO GIVE TRIBUTE TO CAESAR OR NOT

 BUT HE PERCEIVED THEIR CRAFTINESS AND SAID TO THEM SHOW ME A DENARIUS

WHOSE LIKENESS AND INSCRIPTION DOES IT HAVE

 THEY SAID CAESAR'S

 HE SAID TO THEM THEN RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD'S

 AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE TO CATCH HIM IN WHAT HE SAID BUT MARVELING AT HIS ANSWER THEY BECAME SILENT

THERE CAME TO HIM SOME SADDUCEES THOSE WHO DENY THAT THERE IS A RESURRECTION AND THEY ASKED HIM A QUESTION SAYING TEACHER MOSES WROTE FOR US THAT IF A MAN'S BROTHER DIES HAVING A WIFE BUT NO CHILDREN THE MAN MUST TAKE THE WIDOW AND RAISE UP OFFSPRING FOR HIS BROTHER

NOW THERE WERE SEVEN BROTHERS

THE FIRST TOOK A WIFE AND DIED WITHOUT CHILDREN

AND THE SECOND AND THE THIRD TOOK HER AND LIKEWISE ALL SEVEN LEFT NO CHILDREN AND DIED

AFTERWARD THE WOMAN ALSO DIED

IN THE RESURRECTION THEREFORE WHOSE WIFE WILL THE WOMAN BE

FOR THE SEVEN HAD HER AS WIFE

 AND JESUS SAID TO THEM THE SONS OF THIS AGE MARRY AND ARE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE BUT THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED WORTHY TO ATTAIN TO THAT AGE AND TO THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD NEITHER MARRY NOR ARE GIVEN IN MARRIAGE FOR THEY CANNOT DIE ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY ARE EQUAL TO ANGELS AND ARE SONS OF GOD BEING SONS OF THE RESURRECTION

BUT THAT THE DEAD ARE RAISED EVEN MOSES SHOWED IN THE PASSAGE ABOUT THE BUSH WHERE HE CALLS THE LORD THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB

NOW HE IS NOT GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING FOR ALL LIVE TO HIM

 THEN SOME OF THE SCRIBES ANSWERED TEACHER YOU HAVE SPOKEN WELL

 FOR THEY NO LONGER DARED TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTION

BUT HE SAID TO THEM HOW CAN THEY SAY THAT THE CHRIST IS DAVID'S SON

FOR DAVID HIMSELF SAYS IN THE BOOK OF PSALMS 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES YOUR FOOTSTOOL

' DAVID THUS CALLS HIM LORD SO HOW IS HE HIS SON

 AND IN THE HEARING OF ALL THE PEOPLE HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES BEWARE OF THE SCRIBES WHO LIKE TO WALK AROUND IN LONG ROBES AND LOVE GREETINGS IN THE MARKETPLACES AND THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND THE PLACES OF HONOR AT FEASTS WHO DEVOUR WIDOWS' HOUSES AND FOR A PRETENSE MAKE LONG PRAYERS

THEY WILL RECEIVE THE GREATER CONDEMNATION

JESUS LOOKED UP AND SAW THE RICH PUTTING THEIR GIFTS INTO THE OFFERING BOX AND HE SAW A POOR WIDOW PUT IN TWO SMALL COPPER COINS

AND HE SAID TRULY I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS PUT IN MORE THAN ALL OF THEM

FOR THEY ALL CONTRIBUTED OUT OF THEIR ABUNDANCE BUT SHE OUT OF HER POVERTY PUT IN ALL SHE HAD TO LIVE ON

 AND WHILE SOME WERE SPEAKING OF THE TEMPLE HOW IT WAS ADORNED WITH NOBLE STONES AND OFFERINGS HE SAID AS FOR THESE THINGS THAT YOU SEE THE DAYS WILL COME WHEN THERE WILL NOT BE LEFT HERE ONE STONE UPON ANOTHER THAT WILL NOT BE THROWN DOWN

 AND THEY ASKED HIM TEACHER WHEN WILL THESE THINGS BE AND WHAT WILL BE THE SIGN WHEN THESE THINGS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE

 AND HE SAID SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT LED ASTRAY

FOR MANY WILL COME IN MY NAME SAYING 'I AM HE

' AND 'THE TIME IS AT HAND

' DO NOT GO AFTER THEM

AND WHEN YOU HEAR OF WARS AND TUMULTS DO NOT BE TERRIFIED FOR THESE THINGS MUST FIRST TAKE PLACE BUT THE END WILL NOT BE AT ONCE

 THEN HE SAID TO THEM NATION WILL RISE AGAINST NATION AND KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM

THERE WILL BE GREAT EARTHQUAKES AND IN VARIOUS PLACES FAMINES AND PESTILENCES

AND THERE WILL BE TERRORS AND GREAT SIGNS FROM HEAVEN

BUT BEFORE ALL THIS THEY WILL LAY THEIR HANDS ON YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU DELIVERING YOU UP TO THE SYNAGOGUES AND PRISONS AND YOU WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE KINGS AND GOVERNORS FOR MY NAME'S SAKE

THIS WILL BE YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BEAR WITNESS

SETTLE IT THEREFORE IN YOUR MINDS NOT TO MEDITATE BEFOREHAND HOW TO ANSWER FOR I WILL GIVE YOU A MOUTH AND WISDOM WHICH NONE OF YOUR ADVERSARIES WILL BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND OR CONTRADICT

YOU WILL BE DELIVERED UP EVEN BY PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND SOME OF YOU THEY WILL PUT TO DEATH

YOU WILL BE HATED BY ALL FOR MY NAME'S SAKE

BUT NOT A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD WILL PERISH

BY YOUR ENDURANCE YOU WILL GAIN YOUR LIVES

BUT WHEN YOU SEE JERUSALEM SURROUNDED BY ARMIES THEN KNOW THAT ITS DESOLATION HAS COME NEAR

THEN LET THOSE WHO ARE IN JUDEA FLEE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND LET THOSE WHO ARE INSIDE THE CITY DEPART AND LET NOT THOSE WHO ARE OUT IN THE COUNTRY ENTER IT FOR THESE ARE DAYS OF VENGEANCE TO FULFILL ALL THAT IS WRITTEN

ALAS FOR WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NURSING INFANTS IN THOSE DAYS

FOR THERE WILL BE GREAT DISTRESS UPON THE EARTH AND WRATH AGAINST THIS PEOPLE

THEY WILL FALL BY THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND BE LED CAPTIVE AMONG ALL NATIONS AND JERUSALEM WILL BE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT BY THE GENTILES UNTIL THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES ARE FULFILLED

AND THERE WILL BE SIGNS IN SUN AND MOON AND STARS AND ON THE EARTH DISTRESS OF NATIONS IN PERPLEXITY BECAUSE OF THE ROARING OF THE SEA AND THE WAVES PEOPLE FAINTING WITH FEAR AND WITH FOREBODING OF WHAT IS COMING ON THE WORLD

FOR THE POWERS OF THE HEAVENS WILL BE SHAKEN

AND THEN THEY WILL SEE THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD WITH POWER AND GREAT GLORY

NOW WHEN THESE THINGS BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE STRAIGHTEN UP AND RAISE YOUR HEADS BECAUSE YOUR REDEMPTION IS DRAWING NEAR

 AND HE TOLD THEM A PARABLE LOOK AT THE FIG TREE AND ALL THE TREES

AS SOON AS THEY COME OUT IN LEAF YOU SEE FOR YOURSELVES AND KNOW THAT THE SUMMER IS ALREADY NEAR

SO ALSO WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE YOU KNOW THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR

TRULY I SAY TO YOU THIS GENERATION WILL NOT PASS AWAY UNTIL ALL HAS TAKEN PLACE

HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY BUT MY WORDS WILL NOT PASS AWAY

BUT WATCH YOURSELVES LEST YOUR HEARTS BE WEIGHED DOWN WITH DISSIPATION AND DRUNKENNESS AND CARES OF THIS LIFE AND THAT DAY COME UPON YOU SUDDENLY LIKE A TRAP

FOR IT WILL COME UPON ALL WHO DWELL ON THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH

BUT STAY AWAKE AT ALL TIMES PRAYING THAT YOU MAY HAVE STRENGTH TO ESCAPE ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND TO STAND BEFORE THE SON OF MAN

 AND EVERY DAY HE WAS TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE BUT AT NIGHT HE WENT OUT AND LODGED ON THE MOUNT CALLED OLIVET

AND EARLY IN THE MORNING ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO HIM IN THE TEMPLE TO HEAR HIM

NOW THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD DREW NEAR WHICH IS CALLED THE PASSOVER

AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES WERE SEEKING HOW TO PUT HIM TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED THE PEOPLE

THEN SATAN ENTERED INTO JUDAS CALLED ISCARIOT WHO WAS OF THE NUMBER OF THE TWELVE

HE WENT AWAY AND CONFERRED WITH THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND OFFICERS HOW HE MIGHT BETRAY HIM TO THEM

AND THEY WERE GLAD AND AGREED TO GIVE HIM MONEY

SO HE CONSENTED AND SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETRAY HIM TO THEM IN THE ABSENCE OF A CROWD

THEN CAME THE DAY OF UNLEAVENED BREAD ON WHICH THE PASSOVER LAMB HAD TO BE SACRIFICED

SO JESUS SENT PETER AND JOHN SAYING GO AND PREPARE THE PASSOVER FOR US THAT WE MAY EAT IT

 THEY SAID TO HIM WHERE WILL YOU HAVE US PREPARE IT

 HE SAID TO THEM BEHOLD WHEN YOU HAVE ENTERED THE CITY A MAN CARRYING A JAR OF WATER WILL MEET YOU

FOLLOW HIM INTO THE HOUSE THAT HE ENTERS AND TELL THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE 'THE TEACHER SAYS TO YOU WHERE IS THE GUEST ROOM WHERE I MAY EAT THE PASSOVER WITH MY DISCIPLES

' AND HE WILL SHOW YOU A LARGE UPPER ROOM FURNISHED; PREPARE IT THERE

 AND THEY WENT AND FOUND IT JUST AS HE HAD TOLD THEM AND THEY PREPARED THE PASSOVER

AND WHEN THE HOUR CAME HE RECLINED AT TABLE AND THE APOSTLES WITH HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM I HAVE EARNESTLY DESIRED TO EAT THIS PASSOVER WITH YOU BEFORE I SUFFER

FOR I TELL YOU I WILL NOT EAT IT UNTIL IT IS FULFILLED IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 AND HE TOOK A CUP AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE SAID TAKE THIS AND DIVIDE IT AMONG YOURSELVES

FOR I TELL YOU THAT FROM NOW ON I WILL NOT DRINK OF THE FRUIT OF THE VINE UNTIL THE KINGDOM OF GOD COMES

 AND HE TOOK BREAD AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE BROKE IT AND GAVE IT TO THEM SAYING THIS IS MY BODY WHICH IS GIVEN FOR YOU

DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME

 AND LIKEWISE THE CUP AFTER THEY HAD EATEN SAYING THIS CUP THAT IS POURED OUT FOR YOU IS THE NEW COVENANT IN MY BLOOD

BUT BEHOLD THE HAND OF HIM WHO BETRAYS ME IS WITH ME ON THE TABLE

FOR THE SON OF MAN GOES AS IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BUT WOE TO THAT MAN BY WHOM HE IS BETRAYED

 AND THEY BEGAN TO QUESTION ONE ANOTHER WHICH OF THEM IT COULD BE WHO WAS GOING TO DO THIS

A DISPUTE ALSO AROSE AMONG THEM AS TO WHICH OF THEM WAS TO BE REGARDED AS THE GREATEST

AND HE SAID TO THEM THE KINGS OF THE GENTILES EXERCISE LORDSHIP OVER THEM AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY OVER THEM ARE CALLED BENEFACTORS

BUT NOT SO WITH YOU

RATHER LET THE GREATEST AMONG YOU BECOME AS THE YOUNGEST AND THE LEADER AS ONE WHO SERVES

FOR WHO IS THE GREATER ONE WHO RECLINES AT TABLE OR ONE WHO SERVES

IS IT NOT THE ONE WHO RECLINES AT TABLE

BUT I AM AMONG YOU AS THE ONE WHO SERVES

YOU ARE THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED WITH ME IN MY TRIALS AND I ASSIGN TO YOU AS MY FATHER ASSIGNED TO ME A KINGDOM THAT YOU MAY EAT AND DRINK AT MY TABLE IN MY KINGDOM AND SIT ON THRONES JUDGING THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

SIMON SIMON BEHOLD SATAN DEMANDED TO HAVE YOU THAT HE MIGHT SIFT YOU LIKE WHEAT BUT I HAVE PRAYED FOR YOU THAT YOUR FAITH MAY NOT FAIL

AND WHEN YOU HAVE TURNED AGAIN STRENGTHEN YOUR BROTHERS

 PETER SAID TO HIM LORD I AM READY TO GO WITH YOU BOTH TO PRISON AND TO DEATH

 JESUS SAID I TELL YOU PETER THE ROOSTER WILL NOT CROW THIS DAY UNTIL YOU DENY THREE TIMES THAT YOU KNOW ME

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHEN I SENT YOU OUT WITH NO MONEYBAG OR KNAPSACK OR SANDALS DID YOU LACK ANYTHING

 THEY SAID NOTHING

 HE SAID TO THEM BUT NOW LET THE ONE WHO HAS A MONEYBAG TAKE IT AND LIKEWISE A KNAPSACK

AND LET THE ONE WHO HAS NO SWORD SELL HIS CLOAK AND BUY ONE

FOR I TELL YOU THAT THIS SCRIPTURE MUST BE FULFILLED IN ME 'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS

' FOR WHAT IS WRITTEN ABOUT ME HAS ITS FULFILLMENT

 AND THEY SAID LOOK LORD HERE ARE TWO SWORDS

 AND HE SAID TO THEM IT IS ENOUGH

 AND HE CAME OUT AND WENT AS WAS HIS CUSTOM TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES AND THE DISCIPLES FOLLOWED HIM

AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE PLACE HE SAID TO THEM PRAY THAT YOU MAY NOT ENTER INTO TEMPTATION

 AND HE WITHDREW FROM THEM ABOUT A STONE'S THROW AND KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED SAYING FATHER IF YOU ARE WILLING REMOVE THIS CUP FROM ME

NEVERTHELESS NOT MY WILL BUT YOURS BE DONE

 AND THERE APPEARED TO HIM AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN STRENGTHENING HIM

AND BEING IN AN AGONY HE PRAYED MORE EARNESTLY; AND HIS SWEAT BECAME LIKE GREAT DROPS OF BLOOD FALLING DOWN TO THE GROUND

AND WHEN HE ROSE FROM PRAYER HE CAME TO THE DISCIPLES AND FOUND THEM SLEEPING FOR SORROW AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING

RISE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY NOT ENTER INTO TEMPTATION

 WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING THERE CAME A CROWD AND THE MAN CALLED JUDAS ONE OF THE TWELVE WAS LEADING THEM

HE DREW NEAR TO JESUS TO KISS HIM BUT JESUS SAID TO HIM JUDAS WOULD YOU BETRAY THE SON OF MAN WITH A KISS

 AND WHEN THOSE WHO WERE AROUND HIM SAW WHAT WOULD FOLLOW THEY SAID LORD SHALL WE STRIKE WITH THE SWORD

 AND ONE OF THEM STRUCK THE SERVANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST AND CUT OFF HIS RIGHT EAR

BUT JESUS SAID NO MORE OF THIS

 AND HE TOUCHED HIS EAR AND HEALED HIM

THEN JESUS SAID TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND OFFICERS OF THE TEMPLE AND ELDERS WHO HAD COME OUT AGAINST HIM HAVE YOU COME OUT AS AGAINST A ROBBER WITH SWORDS AND CLUBS

WHEN I WAS WITH YOU DAY AFTER DAY IN THE TEMPLE YOU DID NOT LAY HANDS ON ME

BUT THIS IS YOUR HOUR AND THE POWER OF DARKNESS

 THEN THEY SEIZED HIM AND LED HIM AWAY BRINGING HIM INTO THE HIGH PRIEST'S HOUSE AND PETER WAS FOLLOWING AT A DISTANCE

AND WHEN THEY HAD KINDLED A FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURTYARD AND SAT DOWN TOGETHER PETER SAT DOWN AMONG THEM

THEN A SERVANT GIRL SEEING HIM AS HE SAT IN THE LIGHT AND LOOKING CLOSELY AT HIM SAID THIS MAN ALSO WAS WITH HIM

 BUT HE DENIED IT SAYING WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW HIM

 AND A LITTLE LATER SOMEONE ELSE SAW HIM AND SAID YOU ALSO ARE ONE OF THEM

 BUT PETER SAID MAN I AM NOT

 AND AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ABOUT AN HOUR STILL ANOTHER INSISTED SAYING CERTAINLY THIS MAN ALSO WAS WITH HIM FOR HE TOO IS A GALILEAN

 BUT PETER SAID MAN I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

 AND IMMEDIATELY WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING THE ROOSTER CROWED

AND THE LORD TURNED AND LOOKED AT PETER

AND PETER REMEMBERED THE SAYING OF THE LORD HOW HE HAD SAID TO HIM BEFORE THE ROOSTER CROWS TODAY YOU WILL DENY ME THREE TIMES

 AND HE WENT OUT AND WEPT BITTERLY

NOW THE MEN WHO WERE HOLDING JESUS IN CUSTODY WERE MOCKING HIM AS THEY BEAT HIM

THEY ALSO BLINDFOLDED HIM AND KEPT ASKING HIM PROPHESY

WHO IS IT THAT STRUCK YOU

 AND THEY SAID MANY OTHER THINGS AGAINST HIM BLASPHEMING HIM

WHEN DAY CAME THE ASSEMBLY OF THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER BOTH CHIEF PRIESTS AND SCRIBES

AND THEY LED HIM AWAY TO THEIR COUNCIL AND THEY SAID IF YOU ARE THE CHRIST TELL US

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM IF I TELL YOU YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE AND IF I ASK YOU YOU WILL NOT ANSWER

BUT FROM NOW ON THE SON OF MAN SHALL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE POWER OF GOD

 SO THEY ALL SAID ARE YOU THE SON OF GOD THEN

 AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU SAY THAT I AM

 THEN THEY SAID WHAT FURTHER TESTIMONY DO WE NEED

WE HAVE HEARD IT OURSELVES FROM HIS OWN LIPS

THEN THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THEM AROSE AND BROUGHT HIM BEFORE PILATE

AND THEY BEGAN TO ACCUSE HIM SAYING WE FOUND THIS MAN MISLEADING OUR NATION AND FORBIDDING US TO GIVE TRIBUTE TO CAESAR AND SAYING THAT HE HIMSELF IS CHRIST A KING

 AND PILATE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 AND HE ANSWERED HIM YOU HAVE SAID SO

 THEN PILATE SAID TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE CROWDS I FIND NO GUILT IN THIS MAN

 BUT THEY WERE URGENT SAYING HE STIRS UP THE PEOPLE TEACHING THROUGHOUT ALL JUDEA FROM GALILEE EVEN TO THIS PLACE

 WHEN PILATE HEARD THIS HE ASKED WHETHER THE MAN WAS A GALILEAN

AND WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE BELONGED TO HEROD'S JURISDICTION HE SENT HIM OVER TO HEROD WHO WAS HIMSELF IN JERUSALEM AT THAT TIME

WHEN HEROD SAW JESUS HE WAS VERY GLAD FOR HE HAD LONG DESIRED TO SEE HIM BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD ABOUT HIM AND HE WAS HOPING TO SEE SOME SIGN DONE BY HIM

SO HE QUESTIONED HIM AT SOME LENGTH BUT HE MADE NO ANSWER

THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE SCRIBES STOOD BY VEHEMENTLY ACCUSING HIM

AND HEROD WITH HIS SOLDIERS TREATED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND MOCKED HIM

THEN ARRAYING HIM IN SPLENDID CLOTHING HE SENT HIM BACK TO PILATE

AND HEROD AND PILATE BECAME FRIENDS WITH EACH OTHER THAT VERY DAY FOR BEFORE THIS THEY HAD BEEN AT ENMITY WITH EACH OTHER

PILATE THEN CALLED TOGETHER THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE RULERS AND THE PEOPLE AND SAID TO THEM YOU BROUGHT ME THIS MAN AS ONE WHO WAS MISLEADING THE PEOPLE

AND AFTER EXAMINING HIM BEFORE YOU BEHOLD I DID NOT FIND THIS MAN GUILTY OF ANY OF YOUR CHARGES AGAINST HIM

NEITHER DID HEROD FOR HE SENT HIM BACK TO US

LOOK NOTHING DESERVING DEATH HAS BEEN DONE BY HIM

I WILL THEREFORE PUNISH AND RELEASE HIM

 SEE FOOTNOTE BUT THEY ALL CRIED OUT TOGETHER AWAY WITH THIS MAN AND RELEASE TO US BARABBAS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN THROWN INTO PRISON FOR AN INSURRECTION STARTED IN THE CITY AND FOR MURDER

PILATE ADDRESSED THEM ONCE MORE DESIRING TO RELEASE JESUS BUT THEY KEPT SHOUTING CRUCIFY CRUCIFY HIM

 A THIRD TIME HE SAID TO THEM WHY WHAT EVIL HAS HE DONE

I HAVE FOUND IN HIM NO GUILT DESERVING DEATH

I WILL THEREFORE PUNISH AND RELEASE HIM

 BUT THEY WERE URGENT DEMANDING WITH LOUD CRIES THAT HE SHOULD BE CRUCIFIED

AND THEIR VOICES PREVAILED

SO PILATE DECIDED THAT THEIR DEMAND SHOULD BE GRANTED

HE RELEASED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN THROWN INTO PRISON FOR INSURRECTION AND MURDER FOR WHOM THEY ASKED BUT HE DELIVERED JESUS OVER TO THEIR WILL

AND AS THEY LED HIM AWAY THEY SEIZED ONE SIMON OF CYRENE WHO WAS COMING IN FROM THE COUNTRY AND LAID ON HIM THE CROSS TO CARRY IT BEHIND JESUS

AND THERE FOLLOWED HIM A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE AND OF WOMEN WHO WERE MOURNING AND LAMENTING FOR HIM

BUT TURNING TO THEM JESUS SAID DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM DO NOT WEEP FOR ME BUT WEEP FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR YOUR CHILDREN

FOR BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN THEY WILL SAY 'BLESSED ARE THE BARREN AND THE WOMBS THAT NEVER BORE AND THE BREASTS THAT NEVER NURSED

' THEN THEY WILL BEGIN TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS 'FALL ON US' AND TO THE HILLS 'COVER US

' FOR IF THEY DO THESE THINGS WHEN THE WOOD IS GREEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN IT IS DRY

 TWO OTHERS WHO WERE CRIMINALS WERE LED AWAY TO BE PUT TO DEATH WITH HIM

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PLACE THAT IS CALLED THE SKULL THERE THEY CRUCIFIED HIM AND THE CRIMINALS ONE ON HIS RIGHT AND ONE ON HIS LEFT

AND JESUS SAID FATHER FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO

 AND THEY CAST LOTS TO DIVIDE HIS GARMENTS

AND THE PEOPLE STOOD BY WATCHING BUT THE RULERS SCOFFED AT HIM SAYING HE SAVED OTHERS; LET HIM SAVE HIMSELF IF HE IS THE CHRIST OF GOD HIS CHOSEN ONE

 THE SOLDIERS ALSO MOCKED HIM COMING UP AND OFFERING HIM SOUR WINE AND SAYING IF YOU ARE THE KING OF THE JEWS SAVE YOURSELF

 THERE WAS ALSO AN INSCRIPTION OVER HIM THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS

 ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WHO WERE HANGED RAILED AT HIM SAYING ARE YOU NOT THE CHRIST

SAVE YOURSELF AND US

 BUT THE OTHER REBUKED HIM SAYING DO YOU NOT FEAR GOD SINCE YOU ARE UNDER THE SAME SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION

AND WE INDEED JUSTLY FOR WE ARE RECEIVING THE DUE REWARD OF OUR DEEDS; BUT THIS MAN HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG

 AND HE SAID JESUS REMEMBER ME WHEN YOU COME INTO YOUR KINGDOM

 AND HE SAID TO HIM TRULY I SAY TO YOU TODAY YOU WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE

 IT WAS NOW ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR AND THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER THE WHOLE LAND UNTIL THE NINTH HOUR WHILE THE SUN'S LIGHT FAILED

AND THE CURTAIN OF THE TEMPLE WAS TORN IN TWO

THEN JESUS CALLING OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE SAID FATHER INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT

 AND HAVING SAID THIS HE BREATHED HIS LAST

NOW WHEN THE CENTURION SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HE PRAISED GOD SAYING CERTAINLY THIS MAN WAS INNOCENT

 AND ALL THE CROWDS THAT HAD ASSEMBLED FOR THIS SPECTACLE WHEN THEY SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE RETURNED HOME BEATING THEIR BREASTS

AND ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND THE WOMEN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM GALILEE STOOD AT A DISTANCE WATCHING THESE THINGS

NOW THERE WAS A MAN NAMED JOSEPH FROM THE JEWISH TOWN OF ARIMATHEA

HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL A GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS MAN WHO HAD NOT CONSENTED TO THEIR DECISION AND ACTION; AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD

THIS MAN WENT TO PILATE AND ASKED FOR THE BODY OF JESUS

THEN HE TOOK IT DOWN AND WRAPPED IT IN A LINEN SHROUD AND LAID HIM IN A TOMB CUT IN STONE WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER YET BEEN LAID

IT WAS THE DAY OF PREPARATION AND THE SABBATH WAS BEGINNING

THE WOMEN WHO HAD COME WITH HIM FROM GALILEE FOLLOWED AND SAW THE TOMB AND HOW HIS BODY WAS LAID

THEN THEY RETURNED AND PREPARED SPICES AND OINTMENTS

ON THE SABBATH THEY RESTED ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT

BUT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK AT EARLY DAWN THEY WENT TO THE TOMB TAKING THE SPICES THEY HAD PREPARED

AND THEY FOUND THE STONE ROLLED AWAY FROM THE TOMB BUT WHEN THEY WENT IN THEY DID NOT FIND THE BODY OF THE LORD JESUS

WHILE THEY WERE PERPLEXED ABOUT THIS BEHOLD TWO MEN STOOD BY THEM IN DAZZLING APPAREL

AND AS THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND BOWED THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND THE MEN SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU SEEK THE LIVING AMONG THE DEAD

HE IS NOT HERE BUT HAS RISEN

REMEMBER HOW HE TOLD YOU WHILE HE WAS STILL IN GALILEE THAT THE SON OF MAN MUST BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF SINFUL MEN AND BE CRUCIFIED AND ON THE THIRD DAY RISE

 AND THEY REMEMBERED HIS WORDS AND RETURNING FROM THE TOMB THEY TOLD ALL THESE THINGS TO THE ELEVEN AND TO ALL THE REST

NOW IT WAS MARY MAGDALENE AND JOANNA AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JAMES AND THE OTHER WOMEN WITH THEM WHO TOLD THESE THINGS TO THE APOSTLES BUT THESE WORDS SEEMED TO THEM AN IDLE TALE AND THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THEM

BUT PETER ROSE AND RAN TO THE TOMB; STOOPING AND LOOKING IN HE SAW THE LINEN CLOTHS BY THEMSELVES; AND HE WENT HOME MARVELING AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED

THAT VERY DAY TWO OF THEM WERE GOING TO A VILLAGE NAMED EMMAUS ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM JERUSALEM AND THEY WERE TALKING WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED

WHILE THEY WERE TALKING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER JESUS HIMSELF DREW NEAR AND WENT WITH THEM

BUT THEIR EYES WERE KEPT FROM RECOGNIZING HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT IS THIS CONVERSATION THAT YOU ARE HOLDING WITH EACH OTHER AS YOU WALK

 AND THEY STOOD STILL LOOKING SAD

THEN ONE OF THEM NAMED CLEOPAS ANSWERED HIM ARE YOU THE ONLY VISITOR TO JERUSALEM WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED THERE IN THESE DAYS

 AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT THINGS

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM CONCERNING JESUS OF NAZARETH A MAN WHO WAS A PROPHET MIGHTY IN DEED AND WORD BEFORE GOD AND ALL THE PEOPLE AND HOW OUR CHIEF PRIESTS AND RULERS DELIVERED HIM UP TO BE CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND CRUCIFIED HIM

BUT WE HAD HOPED THAT HE WAS THE ONE TO REDEEM ISRAEL

YES AND BESIDES ALL THIS IT IS NOW THE THIRD DAY SINCE THESE THINGS HAPPENED

MOREOVER SOME WOMEN OF OUR COMPANY AMAZED US

THEY WERE AT THE TOMB EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WHEN THEY DID NOT FIND HIS BODY THEY CAME BACK SAYING THAT THEY HAD EVEN SEEN A VISION OF ANGELS WHO SAID THAT HE WAS ALIVE

SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE WITH US WENT TO THE TOMB AND FOUND IT JUST AS THE WOMEN HAD SAID BUT HIM THEY DID NOT SEE

 AND HE SAID TO THEM O FOOLISH ONES AND SLOW OF HEART TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SPOKEN

WAS IT NOT NECESSARY THAT THE CHRIST SHOULD SUFFER THESE THINGS AND ENTER INTO HIS GLORY

 AND BEGINNING WITH MOSES AND ALL THE PROPHETS HE INTERPRETED TO THEM IN ALL THE SCRIPTURES THE THINGS CONCERNING HIMSELF

SO THEY DREW NEAR TO THE VILLAGE TO WHICH THEY WERE GOING

HE ACTED AS IF HE WERE GOING FARTHER BUT THEY URGED HIM STRONGLY SAYING STAY WITH US FOR IT IS TOWARD EVENING AND THE DAY IS NOW FAR SPENT

 SO HE WENT IN TO STAY WITH THEM

WHEN HE WAS AT TABLE WITH THEM HE TOOK THE BREAD AND BLESSED AND BROKE IT AND GAVE IT TO THEM

AND THEIR EYES WERE OPENED AND THEY RECOGNIZED HIM

AND HE VANISHED FROM THEIR SIGHT

THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER DID NOT OUR HEARTS BURN WITHIN US WHILE HE TALKED TO US ON THE ROAD WHILE HE OPENED TO US THE SCRIPTURES

 AND THEY ROSE THAT SAME HOUR AND RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

AND THEY FOUND THE ELEVEN AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH THEM GATHERED TOGETHER SAYING THE LORD HAS RISEN INDEED AND HAS APPEARED TO SIMON

 THEN THEY TOLD WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON THE ROAD AND HOW HE WAS KNOWN TO THEM IN THE BREAKING OF THE BREAD

AS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS JESUS HIMSELF STOOD AMONG THEM AND SAID TO THEM PEACE TO YOU

 BUT THEY WERE STARTLED AND FRIGHTENED AND THOUGHT THEY SAW A SPIRIT

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU TROUBLED AND WHY DO DOUBTS ARISE IN YOUR HEARTS

SEE MY HANDS AND MY FEET THAT IT IS I MYSELF

TOUCH ME AND SEE

FOR A SPIRIT DOES NOT HAVE FLESH AND BONES AS YOU SEE THAT I HAVE

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE SHOWED THEM HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET

AND WHILE THEY STILL DISBELIEVED FOR JOY AND WERE MARVELING HE SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU ANYTHING HERE TO EAT

 THEY GAVE HIM A PIECE OF BROILED FISH AND HE TOOK IT AND ATE BEFORE THEM

THEN HE SAID TO THEM THESE ARE MY WORDS THAT I SPOKE TO YOU WHILE I WAS STILL WITH YOU THAT EVERYTHING WRITTEN ABOUT ME IN THE LAW OF MOSES AND THE PROPHETS AND THE PSALMS MUST BE FULFILLED

 THEN HE OPENED THEIR MINDS TO UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES AND SAID TO THEM THUS IT IS WRITTEN THAT THE CHRIST SHOULD SUFFER AND ON THE THIRD DAY RISE FROM THE DEAD AND THAT REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS SHOULD BE PROCLAIMED IN HIS NAME TO ALL NATIONS BEGINNING FROM JERUSALEM

YOU ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS

AND BEHOLD I AM SENDING THE PROMISE OF MY FATHER UPON YOU

BUT STAY IN THE CITY UNTIL YOU ARE CLOTHED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH

 THEN HE LED THEM OUT AS FAR AS BETHANY AND LIFTING UP HIS HANDS HE BLESSED THEM

WHILE HE BLESSED THEM HE PARTED FROM THEM AND WAS CARRIED UP INTO HEAVEN

AND THEY WORSHIPED HIM AND RETURNED TO JERUSALEM WITH GREAT JOY AND WERE CONTINUALLY IN THE TEMPLE BLESSING GOD

I ADJURE YOU O DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM THAT YOU NOT STIR UP OR AWAKEN LOVE UNTIL IT PLEASES

WHO IS THAT COMING UP FROM THE WILDERNESS LEANING ON HER BELOVED

UNDER THE APPLE TREE I AWAKENED YOU

THERE YOUR MOTHER WAS IN LABOR WITH YOU; THERE SHE WHO BORE YOU WAS IN LABOR

SET ME AS A SEAL UPON YOUR HEART AS A SEAL UPON YOUR ARM FOR LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH JEALOUSY IS FIERCE AS THE GRAVE

ITS FLASHES ARE FLASHES OF FIRE THE VERY FLAME OF THE LORD

MANY WATERS CANNOT QUENCH LOVE NEITHER CAN FLOODS DROWN IT

IF A MAN OFFERED FOR LOVE ALL THE WEALTH OF HIS HOUSE HE WOULD BE UTTERLY DESPISED

WE HAVE A LITTLE SISTER AND SHE HAS NO BREASTS

WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR OUR SISTER ON THE DAY WHEN SHE IS SPOKEN FOR

IF SHE IS A WALL WE WILL BUILD ON HER A BATTLEMENT OF SILVER BUT IF SHE IS A DOOR WE WILL ENCLOSE HER WITH BOARDS OF CEDAR

I WAS A WALL AND MY BREASTS WERE LIKE TOWERS; THEN I WAS IN HIS EYES AS ONE WHO FINDS PEACE

SOLOMON HAD A VINEYARD AT BAALHAMON; HE LET OUT THE VINEYARD TO KEEPERS; EACH ONE WAS TO BRING FOR ITS FRUIT A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER

MY VINEYARD MY VERY OWN IS BEFORE ME; YOU O SOLOMON MAY HAVE THE THOUSAND AND THE KEEPERS OF THE FRUIT TWO HUNDRED

O YOU WHO DWELL IN THE GARDENS WITH COMPANIONS LISTENING FOR YOUR VOICE; LET ME HEAR IT

MAKE HASTE MY BELOVED AND BE LIKE A GAZELLE OR A YOUNG STAG ON THE MOUNTAINS OF SPICES

JONAHNOW THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JONAH THE SON OF AMITTAI SAYING ARISE GO TO NINEVEH THAT GREAT CITY AND CALL OUT AGAINST IT FOR THEIR EVIL HAS COME UP BEFORE ME

 BUT JONAH ROSE TO FLEE TO TARSHISH FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD

HE WENT DOWN TO JOPPA AND FOUND A SHIP GOING TO TARSHISH

SO HE PAID THE FARE AND WENT ON BOARD TO GO WITH THEM TO TARSHISH AWAY FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD

BUT THE LORD HURLED A GREAT WIND UPON THE SEA AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY TEMPEST ON THE SEA SO THAT THE SHIP THREATENED TO BREAK UP

THEN THE MARINERS WERE AFRAID AND EACH CRIED OUT TO HIS GOD

AND THEY HURLED THE CARGO THAT WAS IN THE SHIP INTO THE SEA TO LIGHTEN IT FOR THEM

BUT JONAH HAD GONE DOWN INTO THE INNER PART OF THE SHIP AND HAD LAIN DOWN AND WAS FAST ASLEEP

SO THE CAPTAIN CAME AND SAID TO HIM WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SLEEPER

ARISE CALL OUT TO YOUR GOD

PERHAPS THE GOD WILL GIVE A THOUGHT TO US THAT WE MAY NOT PERISH

 AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER COME LET US CAST LOTS THAT WE MAY KNOW ON WHOSE ACCOUNT THIS EVIL HAS COME UPON US

 SO THEY CAST LOTS AND THE LOT FELL ON JONAH

THEN THEY SAID TO HIM TELL US ON WHOSE ACCOUNT THIS EVIL HAS COME UPON US

WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION

AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY

AND OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM I AM A HEBREW AND I FEAR THE LORD THE GOD OF HEAVEN WHO MADE THE SEA AND THE DRY LAND

 THEN THE MEN WERE EXCEEDINGLY AFRAID AND SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE

 FOR THE MEN KNEW THAT HE WAS FLEEING FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD BECAUSE HE HAD TOLD THEM

THEN THEY SAID TO HIM WHAT SHALL WE DO TO YOU THAT THE SEA MAY QUIET DOWN FOR US

 FOR THE SEA GREW MORE AND MORE TEMPESTUOUS

HE SAID TO THEM PICK ME UP AND HURL ME INTO THE SEA; THEN THE SEA WILL QUIET DOWN FOR YOU FOR I KNOW IT IS BECAUSE OF ME THAT THIS GREAT TEMPEST HAS COME UPON YOU

 NEVERTHELESS THE MEN ROWED HARD TO GET BACK TO DRY LAND BUT THEY COULD NOT FOR THE SEA GREW MORE AND MORE TEMPESTUOUS AGAINST THEM

THEREFORE THEY CALLED OUT TO THE LORD O LORD LET US NOT PERISH FOR THIS MAN'S LIFE AND LAY NOT ON US INNOCENT BLOOD FOR YOU O LORD HAVE DONE AS IT PLEASED YOU

 SO THEY PICKED UP JONAH AND HURLED HIM INTO THE SEA AND THE SEA CEASED FROM ITS RAGING

THEN THE MEN FEARED THE LORD EXCEEDINGLY AND THEY OFFERED A SACRIFICE TO THE LORD AND MADE VOWS

AND THE LORD APPOINTED A GREAT FISH TO SWALLOW UP JONAH

AND JONAH WAS IN THE BELLY OF THE FISH THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS

THEN JONAH PRAYED TO THE LORD HIS GOD FROM THE BELLY OF THE FISH SAYING I CALLED OUT TO THE LORD OUT OF MY DISTRESS AND HE ANSWERED ME; OUT OF THE BELLY OF SHEOL I CRIED AND YOU HEARD MY VOICE

FOR YOU CAST ME INTO THE DEEP INTO THE HEART OF THE SEAS AND THE FLOOD SURROUNDED ME; ALL YOUR WAVES AND YOUR BILLOWS PASSED OVER ME

THEN I SAID 'I AM DRIVEN AWAY FROM YOUR SIGHT; YET I SHALL AGAIN LOOK UPON YOUR HOLY TEMPLE

' THE WATERS CLOSED IN OVER ME TO TAKE MY LIFE; THE DEEP SURROUNDED ME; WEEDS WERE WRAPPED ABOUT MY HEAD AT THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS

I WENT DOWN TO THE LAND WHOSE BARS CLOSED UPON ME FOREVER; YET YOU BROUGHT UP MY LIFE FROM THE PIT O LORD MY GOD

WHEN MY LIFE WAS FAINTING AWAY I REMEMBERED THE LORD AND MY PRAYER CAME TO YOU INTO YOUR HOLY TEMPLE

THOSE WHO PAY REGARD TO VAIN IDOLS FORSAKE THEIR HOPE OF STEADFAST LOVE

BUT I WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING WILL SACRIFICE TO YOU; WHAT I HAVE VOWED I WILL PAY

SALVATION BELONGS TO THE LORD

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO THE FISH AND IT VOMITED JONAH OUT UPON THE DRY LAND

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JONAH THE SECOND TIME SAYING ARISE GO TO NINEVEH THAT GREAT CITY AND CALL OUT AGAINST IT THE MESSAGE THAT I TELL YOU

 SO JONAH AROSE AND WENT TO NINEVEH ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

NOW NINEVEH WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT CITY THREE DAYS' JOURNEY IN BREADTH

JONAH BEGAN TO GO INTO THE CITY GOING A DAY'S JOURNEY

AND HE CALLED OUT YET FORTY DAYS AND NINEVEH SHALL BE OVERTHROWN

 AND THE PEOPLE OF NINEVEH BELIEVED GOD

THEY CALLED FOR A FAST AND PUT ON SACKCLOTH FROM THE GREATEST OF THEM TO THE LEAST OF THEM

THE WORD REACHED THE KING OF NINEVEH AND HE AROSE FROM HIS THRONE REMOVED HIS ROBE COVERED HIMSELF WITH SACKCLOTH AND SAT IN ASHES

AND HE ISSUED A PROCLAMATION AND PUBLISHED THROUGH NINEVEH BY THE DECREE OF THE KING AND HIS NOBLES LET NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST HERD NOR FLOCK TASTE ANYTHING

LET THEM NOT FEED OR DRINK WATER BUT LET MAN AND BEAST BE COVERED WITH SACKCLOTH AND LET THEM CALL OUT MIGHTILY TO GOD

LET EVERYONE TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY AND FROM THE VIOLENCE THAT IS IN HIS HANDS

WHO KNOWS

GOD MAY TURN AND RELENT AND TURN FROM HIS FIERCE ANGER SO THAT WE MAY NOT PERISH

 WHEN GOD SAW WHAT THEY DID HOW THEY TURNED FROM THEIR EVIL WAY GOD RELENTED OF THE DISASTER THAT HE HAD SAID HE WOULD DO TO THEM AND HE DID NOT DO IT

BUT IT DISPLEASED JONAH EXCEEDINGLY AND HE WAS ANGRY

AND HE PRAYED TO THE LORD AND SAID O LORD IS NOT THIS WHAT I SAID WHEN I WAS YET IN MY COUNTRY

THAT IS WHY I MADE HASTE TO FLEE TO TARSHISH; FOR I KNEW THAT YOU ARE A GRACIOUS GOD AND MERCIFUL SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE AND RELENTING FROM DISASTER

THEREFORE NOW O LORD PLEASE TAKE MY LIFE FROM ME FOR IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO DIE THAN TO LIVE

 AND THE LORD SAID DO YOU DO WELL TO BE ANGRY

 JONAH WENT OUT OF THE CITY AND SAT TO THE EAST OF THE CITY AND MADE A BOOTH FOR HIMSELF THERE

HE SAT UNDER IT IN THE SHADE TILL HE SHOULD SEE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE CITY

NOW THE LORD GOD APPOINTED A PLANT AND MADE IT COME UP OVER JONAH THAT IT MIGHT BE A SHADE OVER HIS HEAD TO SAVE HIM FROM HIS DISCOMFORT

SO JONAH WAS EXCEEDINGLY GLAD BECAUSE OF THE PLANT

BUT WHEN DAWN CAME UP THE NEXT DAY GOD APPOINTED A WORM THAT ATTACKED THE PLANT SO THAT IT WITHERED

WHEN THE SUN ROSE GOD APPOINTED A SCORCHING EAST WIND AND THE SUN BEAT DOWN ON THE HEAD OF JONAH SO THAT HE WAS FAINT

AND HE ASKED THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SAID IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO DIE THAN TO LIVE

 BUT GOD SAID TO JONAH DO YOU DO WELL TO BE ANGRY FOR THE PLANT

 AND HE SAID YES I DO WELL TO BE ANGRY ANGRY ENOUGH TO DIE

 AND THE LORD SAID YOU PITY THE PLANT FOR WHICH YOU DID NOT LABOR NOR DID YOU MAKE IT GROW WHICH CAME INTO BEING IN A NIGHT AND PERISHED IN A NIGHT

AND SHOULD NOT I PITY NINEVEH THAT GREAT CITY IN WHICH THERE ARE MORE THAN  PERSONS WHO DO NOT KNOW THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM THEIR LEFT AND ALSO MUCH CATTLE

ACTSIN THE FIRST BOOK O THEOPHILUS I HAVE DEALT WITH ALL THAT JESUS BEGAN TO DO AND TEACH UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE WAS TAKEN UP AFTER HE HAD GIVEN COMMANDS THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT TO THE APOSTLES WHOM HE HAD CHOSEN

TO THEM HE PRESENTED HIMSELF ALIVE AFTER HIS SUFFERING BY MANY PROOFS APPEARING TO THEM DURING FORTY DAYS AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AND WHILE STAYING WITH THEM HE ORDERED THEM NOT TO DEPART FROM JERUSALEM BUT TO WAIT FOR THE PROMISE OF THE FATHER WHICH HE SAID YOU HEARD FROM ME; FOR JOHN BAPTIZED WITH WATER BUT YOU WILL BE BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT NOT MANY DAYS FROM NOW

 SO WHEN THEY HAD COME TOGETHER THEY ASKED HIM LORD WILL YOU AT THIS TIME RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO ISRAEL

 HE SAID TO THEM IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO KNOW TIMES OR SEASONS THAT THE FATHER HAS FIXED BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY

BUT YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS COME UPON YOU AND YOU WILL BE MY WITNESSES IN JERUSALEM AND IN ALL JUDEA AND SAMARIA AND TO THE END OF THE EARTH

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS AS THEY WERE LOOKING ON HE WAS LIFTED UP AND A CLOUD TOOK HIM OUT OF THEIR SIGHT

AND WHILE THEY WERE GAZING INTO HEAVEN AS HE WENT BEHOLD TWO MEN STOOD BY THEM IN WHITE ROBES AND SAID MEN OF GALILEE WHY DO YOU STAND LOOKING INTO HEAVEN

THIS JESUS WHO WAS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN WILL COME IN THE SAME WAY AS YOU SAW HIM GO INTO HEAVEN

 THEN THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM FROM THE MOUNT CALLED OLIVET WHICH IS NEAR JERUSALEM A SABBATH DAY'S JOURNEY AWAY

AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED THEY WENT UP TO THE UPPER ROOM WHERE THEY WERE STAYING PETER AND JOHN AND JAMES AND ANDREW PHILIP AND THOMAS BARTHOLOMEW AND MATTHEW JAMES THE SON OF ALPHAEUS AND SIMON THE ZEALOT AND JUDAS THE SON OF JAMES

ALL THESE WITH ONE ACCORD WERE DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO PRAYER TOGETHER WITH THE WOMEN AND MARY THE MOTHER OF JESUS AND HIS BROTHERS

IN THOSE DAYS PETER STOOD UP AMONG THE BROTHERS THE COMPANY OF PERSONS WAS IN ALL ABOUT  AND SAID BROTHERS THE SCRIPTURE HAD TO BE FULFILLED WHICH THE HOLY SPIRIT SPOKE BEFOREHAND BY THE MOUTH OF DAVID CONCERNING JUDAS WHO BECAME A GUIDE TO THOSE WHO ARRESTED JESUS

FOR HE WAS NUMBERED AMONG US AND WAS ALLOTTED HIS SHARE IN THIS MINISTRY

 NOW THIS MAN BOUGHT A FIELD WITH THE REWARD OF HIS WICKEDNESS AND FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN IN THE MIDDLE AND ALL HIS BOWELS GUSHED OUT

AND IT BECAME KNOWN TO ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SO THAT THE FIELD WAS CALLED IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AKELDAMA THAT IS FIELD OF BLOOD

 FOR IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF PSALMS 'MAY HIS CAMP BECOME DESOLATE AND LET THERE BE NO ONE TO DWELL IN IT';AND 'LET ANOTHER TAKE HIS OFFICE

' SO ONE OF THE MEN WHO HAVE ACCOMPANIED US DURING ALL THE TIME THAT THE LORD JESUS WENT IN AND OUT AMONG US BEGINNING FROM THE BAPTISM OF JOHN UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE WAS TAKEN UP FROM USONE OF THESE MEN MUST BECOME WITH US A WITNESS TO HIS RESURRECTION

 AND THEY PUT FORWARD TWO JOSEPH CALLED BARSABBAS WHO WAS ALSO CALLED JUSTUS AND MATTHIAS

AND THEY PRAYED AND SAID YOU LORD WHO KNOW THE HEARTS OF ALL SHOW WHICH ONE OF THESE TWO YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE THE PLACE IN THIS MINISTRY AND APOSTLESHIP FROM WHICH JUDAS TURNED ASIDE TO GO TO HIS OWN PLACE

 AND THEY CAST LOTS FOR THEM AND THE LOT FELL ON MATTHIAS AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH THE ELEVEN APOSTLES

WHEN THE DAY OF PENTECOST ARRIVED THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE

AND SUDDENLY THERE CAME FROM HEAVEN A SOUND LIKE A MIGHTY RUSHING WIND AND IT FILLED THE ENTIRE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE SITTING

AND DIVIDED TONGUES AS OF FIRE APPEARED TO THEM AND RESTED ON EACH ONE OF THEM

AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK IN OTHER TONGUES AS THE SPIRIT GAVE THEM UTTERANCE

NOW THERE WERE DWELLING IN JERUSALEM JEWS DEVOUT MEN FROM EVERY NATION UNDER HEAVEN

AND AT THIS SOUND THE MULTITUDE CAME TOGETHER AND THEY WERE BEWILDERED BECAUSE EACH ONE WAS HEARING THEM SPEAK IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE

AND THEY WERE AMAZED AND ASTONISHED SAYING ARE NOT ALL THESE WHO ARE SPEAKING GALILEANS

AND HOW IS IT THAT WE HEAR EACH OF US IN HIS OWN NATIVE LANGUAGE

PARTHIANS AND MEDES AND ELAMITES AND RESIDENTS OF MESOPOTAMIA JUDEA AND CAPPADOCIA PONTUS AND ASIA PHRYGIA AND PAMPHYLIA EGYPT AND THE PARTS OF LIBYA BELONGING TO CYRENE AND VISITORS FROM ROME BOTH JEWS AND PROSELYTES CRETANS AND ARABIANSWE HEAR THEM TELLING IN OUR OWN TONGUES THE MIGHTY WORKS OF GOD

 AND ALL WERE AMAZED AND PERPLEXED SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

 BUT OTHERS MOCKING SAID THEY ARE FILLED WITH NEW WINE

 BUT PETER STANDING WITH THE ELEVEN LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND ADDRESSED THEM MEN OF JUDEA AND ALL WHO DWELL IN JERUSALEM LET THIS BE KNOWN TO YOU AND GIVE EAR TO MY WORDS

FOR THESE MEN ARE NOT DRUNK AS YOU SUPPOSE SINCE IT IS ONLY THE THIRD HOUR OF THE DAY

BUT THIS IS WHAT WAS UTTERED THROUGH THE PROPHET JOEL 'AND IN THE LAST DAYS IT SHALL BE GOD DECLARES THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT ON ALL FLESH AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS; EVEN ON MY MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS IN THOSE DAYS I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT AND THEY SHALL PROPHESY

AND I WILL SHOW WONDERS IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BELOW BLOOD AND FIRE AND VAPOR OF SMOKE; THE SUN SHALL BE TURNED TO DARKNESS AND THE MOON TO BLOOD BEFORE THE DAY OF THE LORD COMES THE GREAT AND MAGNIFICENT DAY

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED

' MEN OF ISRAEL HEAR THESE WORDS JESUS OF NAZARETH A MAN ATTESTED TO YOU BY GOD WITH MIGHTY WORKS AND WONDERS AND SIGNS THAT GOD DID THROUGH HIM IN YOUR MIDST AS YOU YOURSELVES KNOW THIS JESUS DELIVERED UP ACCORDING TO THE DEFINITE PLAN AND FOREKNOWLEDGE OF GOD YOU CRUCIFIED AND KILLED BY THE HANDS OF LAWLESS MEN

GOD RAISED HIM UP LOOSING THE PANGS OF DEATH BECAUSE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE HELD BY IT

FOR DAVID SAYS CONCERNING HIM 'I SAW THE LORD ALWAYS BEFORE ME FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND THAT I MAY NOT BE SHAKEN; THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE REJOICED; MY FLESH ALSO WILL DWELL IN HOPE

FOR YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES OR LET YOUR HOLY ONE SEE CORRUPTION

YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN TO ME THE PATHS OF LIFE; YOU WILL MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH YOUR PRESENCE

' BROTHERS I MAY SAY TO YOU WITH CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE PATRIARCH DAVID THAT HE BOTH DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HIS TOMB IS WITH US TO THIS DAY

BEING THEREFORE A PROPHET AND KNOWING THAT GOD HAD SWORN WITH AN OATH TO HIM THAT HE WOULD SET ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE HE FORESAW AND SPOKE ABOUT THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHRIST THAT HE WAS NOT ABANDONED TO HADES NOR DID HIS FLESH SEE CORRUPTION

THIS JESUS GOD RAISED UP AND OF THAT WE ALL ARE WITNESSES

BEING THEREFORE EXALTED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD AND HAVING RECEIVED FROM THE FATHER THE PROMISE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HE HAS POURED OUT THIS THAT YOU YOURSELVES ARE SEEING AND HEARING

FOR DAVID DID NOT ASCEND INTO THE HEAVENS BUT HE HIMSELF SAYS 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES YOUR FOOTSTOOL

' LET ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THEREFORE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT GOD HAS MADE HIM BOTH LORD AND CHRIST THIS JESUS WHOM YOU CRUCIFIED

 NOW WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY WERE CUT TO THE HEART AND SAID TO PETER AND THE REST OF THE APOSTLES BROTHERS WHAT SHALL WE DO

 AND PETER SAID TO THEM REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF YOUR SINS AND YOU WILL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

FOR THE PROMISE IS FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND FOR ALL WHO ARE FAR OFF EVERYONE WHOM THE LORD OUR GOD CALLS TO HIMSELF

 AND WITH MANY OTHER WORDS HE BORE WITNESS AND CONTINUED TO EXHORT THEM SAYING SAVE YOURSELVES FROM THIS CROOKED GENERATION

 SO THOSE WHO RECEIVED HIS WORD WERE BAPTIZED AND THERE WERE ADDED THAT DAY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SOULS

AND THEY DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE APOSTLES' TEACHING AND FELLOWSHIP TO THE BREAKING OF BREAD AND THE PRAYERS

AND AWE CAME UPON EVERY SOUL AND MANY WONDERS AND SIGNS WERE BEING DONE THROUGH THE APOSTLES

AND ALL WHO BELIEVED WERE TOGETHER AND HAD ALL THINGS IN COMMON

AND THEY WERE SELLING THEIR POSSESSIONS AND BELONGINGS AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROCEEDS TO ALL AS ANY HAD NEED

AND DAY BY DAY ATTENDING THE TEMPLE TOGETHER AND BREAKING BREAD IN THEIR HOMES THEY RECEIVED THEIR FOOD WITH GLAD AND GENEROUS HEARTS PRAISING GOD AND HAVING FAVOR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE

AND THE LORD ADDED TO THEIR NUMBER DAY BY DAY THOSE WHO WERE BEING SAVED

NOW PETER AND JOHN WERE GOING UP TO THE TEMPLE AT THE HOUR OF PRAYER THE NINTH HOUR

AND A MAN LAME FROM BIRTH WAS BEING CARRIED WHOM THEY LAID DAILY AT THE GATE OF THE TEMPLE THAT IS CALLED THE BEAUTIFUL GATE TO ASK ALMS OF THOSE ENTERING THE TEMPLE

SEEING PETER AND JOHN ABOUT TO GO INTO THE TEMPLE HE ASKED TO RECEIVE ALMS

AND PETER DIRECTED HIS GAZE AT HIM AS DID JOHN AND SAID LOOK AT US

 AND HE FIXED HIS ATTENTION ON THEM EXPECTING TO RECEIVE SOMETHING FROM THEM

BUT PETER SAID I HAVE NO SILVER AND GOLD BUT WHAT I DO HAVE I GIVE TO YOU

IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH RISE UP AND WALK

 AND HE TOOK HIM BY THE RIGHT HAND AND RAISED HIM UP AND IMMEDIATELY HIS FEET AND ANKLES WERE MADE STRONG

AND LEAPING UP HE STOOD AND BEGAN TO WALK AND ENTERED THE TEMPLE WITH THEM WALKING AND LEAPING AND PRAISING GOD

AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAW HIM WALKING AND PRAISING GOD AND RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE ONE WHO SAT AT THE BEAUTIFUL GATE OF THE TEMPLE ASKING FOR ALMS

AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH WONDER AND AMAZEMENT AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM

WHILE HE CLUNG TO PETER AND JOHN ALL THE PEOPLE RAN TOGETHER TO THEM IN THE PORTICO CALLED SOLOMON'S ASTOUNDED

AND WHEN PETER SAW IT HE ADDRESSED THE PEOPLE MEN OF ISRAEL WHY DO YOU WONDER AT THIS OR WHY DO YOU STARE AT US AS THOUGH BY OUR OWN POWER OR PIETY WE HAVE MADE HIM WALK

THE GOD OF ABRAHAM THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS GLORIFIED HIS SERVANT JESUS WHOM YOU DELIVERED OVER AND DENIED IN THE PRESENCE OF PILATE WHEN HE HAD DECIDED TO RELEASE HIM

BUT YOU DENIED THE HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS ONE AND ASKED FOR A MURDERER TO BE GRANTED TO YOU AND YOU KILLED THE AUTHOR OF LIFE WHOM GOD RAISED FROM THE DEAD

TO THIS WE ARE WITNESSES

AND HIS NAMEBY FAITH IN HIS NAMEHAS MADE THIS MAN STRONG WHOM YOU SEE AND KNOW AND THE FAITH THAT IS THROUGH JESUS HAS GIVEN THE MAN THIS PERFECT HEALTH IN THE PRESENCE OF YOU ALL

AND NOW BROTHERS I KNOW THAT YOU ACTED IN IGNORANCE AS DID ALSO YOUR RULERS

BUT WHAT GOD FORETOLD BY THE MOUTH OF ALL THE PROPHETS THAT HIS CHRIST WOULD SUFFER HE THUS FULFILLED

REPENT THEREFORE AND TURN AGAIN THAT YOUR SINS MAY BE BLOTTED OUT THAT TIMES OF REFRESHING MAY COME FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND THAT HE MAY SEND THE CHRIST APPOINTED FOR YOU JESUS WHOM HEAVEN MUST RECEIVE UNTIL THE TIME FOR RESTORING ALL THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH GOD SPOKE BY THE MOUTH OF HIS HOLY PROPHETS LONG AGO

MOSES SAID 'THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BROTHERS

YOU SHALL LISTEN TO HIM IN WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU

AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERY SOUL WHO DOES NOT LISTEN TO THAT PROPHET SHALL BE DESTROYED FROM THE PEOPLE

' AND ALL THE PROPHETS WHO HAVE SPOKEN FROM SAMUEL AND THOSE WHO CAME AFTER HIM ALSO PROCLAIMED THESE DAYS

YOU ARE THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS AND OF THE COVENANT THAT GOD MADE WITH YOUR FATHERS SAYING TO ABRAHAM 'AND IN YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED

' GOD HAVING RAISED UP HIS SERVANT SENT HIM TO YOU FIRST TO BLESS YOU BY TURNING EVERY ONE OF YOU FROM YOUR WICKEDNESS

AND AS THEY WERE SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE THE PRIESTS AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE AND THE SADDUCEES CAME UPON THEM GREATLY ANNOYED BECAUSE THEY WERE TEACHING THE PEOPLE AND PROCLAIMING IN JESUS THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD

AND THEY ARRESTED THEM AND PUT THEM IN CUSTODY UNTIL THE NEXT DAY FOR IT WAS ALREADY EVENING

BUT MANY OF THOSE WHO HAD HEARD THE WORD BELIEVED AND THE NUMBER OF THE MEN CAME TO ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND

ON THE NEXT DAY THEIR RULERS AND ELDERS AND SCRIBES GATHERED TOGETHER IN JERUSALEM WITH ANNAS THE HIGH PRIEST AND CAIAPHAS AND JOHN AND ALEXANDER AND ALL WHO WERE OF THE HIGHPRIESTLY FAMILY

AND WHEN THEY HAD SET THEM IN THE MIDST THEY INQUIRED BY WHAT POWER OR BY WHAT NAME DID YOU DO THIS

 THEN PETER FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT SAID TO THEM RULERS OF THE PEOPLE AND ELDERS IF WE ARE BEING EXAMINED TODAY CONCERNING A GOOD DEED DONE TO A CRIPPLED MAN BY WHAT MEANS THIS MAN HAS BEEN HEALED LET IT BE KNOWN TO ALL OF YOU AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT BY THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WHOM YOU CRUCIFIED WHOM GOD RAISED FROM THE DEADBY HIM THIS MAN IS STANDING BEFORE YOU WELL

THIS JESUS IS THE STONE THAT WAS REJECTED BY YOU THE BUILDERS WHICH HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE

AND THERE IS SALVATION IN NO ONE ELSE FOR THERE IS NO OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN BY WHICH WE MUST BE SAVED

 NOW WHEN THEY SAW THE BOLDNESS OF PETER AND JOHN AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE UNEDUCATED COMMON MEN THEY WERE ASTONISHED

AND THEY RECOGNIZED THAT THEY HAD BEEN WITH JESUS

BUT SEEING THE MAN WHO WAS HEALED STANDING BESIDE THEM THEY HAD NOTHING TO SAY IN OPPOSITION

BUT WHEN THEY HAD COMMANDED THEM TO LEAVE THE COUNCIL THEY CONFERRED WITH ONE ANOTHER SAYING WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THESE MEN

FOR THAT A NOTABLE SIGN HAS BEEN PERFORMED THROUGH THEM IS EVIDENT TO ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND WE CANNOT DENY IT

BUT IN ORDER THAT IT MAY SPREAD NO FURTHER AMONG THE PEOPLE LET US WARN THEM TO SPEAK NO MORE TO ANYONE IN THIS NAME

 SO THEY CALLED THEM AND CHARGED THEM NOT TO SPEAK OR TEACH AT ALL IN THE NAME OF JESUS

BUT PETER AND JOHN ANSWERED THEM WHETHER IT IS RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD TO LISTEN TO YOU RATHER THAN TO GOD YOU MUST JUDGE FOR WE CANNOT BUT SPEAK OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND HEARD

 AND WHEN THEY HAD FURTHER THREATENED THEM THEY LET THEM GO FINDING NO WAY TO PUNISH THEM BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE FOR ALL WERE PRAISING GOD FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED

FOR THE MAN ON WHOM THIS SIGN OF HEALING WAS PERFORMED WAS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD

WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED THEY WENT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND REPORTED WHAT THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS HAD SAID TO THEM

AND WHEN THEY HEARD IT THEY LIFTED THEIR VOICES TOGETHER TO GOD AND SAID SOVEREIGN LORD WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND EVERYTHING IN THEM WHO THROUGH THE MOUTH OF OUR FATHER DAVID YOUR SERVANT SAID BY THE HOLY SPIRIT 'WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE AND THE PEOPLES PLOT IN VAIN

THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SET THEMSELVES AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED' FOR TRULY IN THIS CITY THERE WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST YOUR HOLY SERVANT JESUS WHOM YOU ANOINTED BOTH HEROD AND PONTIUS PILATE ALONG WITH THE GENTILES AND THE PEOPLES OF ISRAEL TO DO WHATEVER YOUR HAND AND YOUR PLAN HAD PREDESTINED TO TAKE PLACE

AND NOW LORD LOOK UPON THEIR THREATS AND GRANT TO YOUR SERVANTS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK YOUR WORD WITH ALL BOLDNESS WHILE YOU STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TO HEAL AND SIGNS AND WONDERS ARE PERFORMED THROUGH THE NAME OF YOUR HOLY SERVANT JESUS

 AND WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE GATHERED TOGETHER WAS SHAKEN AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND CONTINUED TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD WITH BOLDNESS

NOW THE FULL NUMBER OF THOSE WHO BELIEVED WERE OF ONE HEART AND SOUL AND NO ONE SAID THAT ANY OF THE THINGS THAT BELONGED TO HIM WAS HIS OWN BUT THEY HAD EVERYTHING IN COMMON

AND WITH GREAT POWER THE APOSTLES WERE GIVING THEIR TESTIMONY TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS AND GREAT GRACE WAS UPON THEM ALL

THERE WAS NOT A NEEDY PERSON AMONG THEM FOR AS MANY AS WERE OWNERS OF LANDS OR HOUSES SOLD THEM AND BROUGHT THE PROCEEDS OF WHAT WAS SOLD AND LAID IT AT THE APOSTLES' FEET AND IT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO EACH AS ANY HAD NEED

THUS JOSEPH WHO WAS ALSO CALLED BY THE APOSTLES BARNABAS WHICH MEANS SON OF ENCOURAGEMENT A LEVITE A NATIVE OF CYPRUS SOLD A FIELD THAT BELONGED TO HIM AND BROUGHT THE MONEY AND LAID IT AT THE APOSTLES' FEET

BUT A MAN NAMED ANANIAS WITH HIS WIFE SAPPHIRA SOLD A PIECE OF PROPERTY AND WITH HIS WIFE'S KNOWLEDGE HE KEPT BACK FOR HIMSELF SOME OF THE PROCEEDS AND BROUGHT ONLY A PART OF IT AND LAID IT AT THE APOSTLES' FEET

BUT PETER SAID ANANIAS WHY HAS SATAN FILLED YOUR HEART TO LIE TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AND TO KEEP BACK FOR YOURSELF PART OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE LAND

WHILE IT REMAINED UNSOLD DID IT NOT REMAIN YOUR OWN

AND AFTER IT WAS SOLD WAS IT NOT AT YOUR DISPOSAL

WHY IS IT THAT YOU HAVE CONTRIVED THIS DEED IN YOUR HEART

YOU HAVE NOT LIED TO MEN BUT TO GOD

 WHEN ANANIAS HEARD THESE WORDS HE FELL DOWN AND BREATHED HIS LAST

AND GREAT FEAR CAME UPON ALL WHO HEARD OF IT

THE YOUNG MEN ROSE AND WRAPPED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM OUT AND BURIED HIM

AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ABOUT THREE HOURS HIS WIFE CAME IN NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED

AND PETER SAID TO HER TELL ME WHETHER YOU SOLD THE LAND FOR SO MUCH

 AND SHE SAID YES FOR SO MUCH

 BUT PETER SAID TO HER HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TOGETHER TO TEST THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD

BEHOLD THE FEET OF THOSE WHO HAVE BURIED YOUR HUSBAND ARE AT THE DOOR AND THEY WILL CARRY YOU OUT

 IMMEDIATELY SHE FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND BREATHED HER LAST

WHEN THE YOUNG MEN CAME IN THEY FOUND HER DEAD AND THEY CARRIED HER OUT AND BURIED HER BESIDE HER HUSBAND

AND GREAT FEAR CAME UPON THE WHOLE CHURCH AND UPON ALL WHO HEARD OF THESE THINGS

NOW MANY SIGNS AND WONDERS WERE REGULARLY DONE AMONG THE PEOPLE BY THE HANDS OF THE APOSTLES

AND THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER IN SOLOMON'S PORTICO

NONE OF THE REST DARED JOIN THEM BUT THE PEOPLE HELD THEM IN HIGH ESTEEM

AND MORE THAN EVER BELIEVERS WERE ADDED TO THE LORD MULTITUDES OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SO THAT THEY EVEN CARRIED OUT THE SICK INTO THE STREETS AND LAID THEM ON COTS AND MATS THAT AS PETER CAME BY AT LEAST HIS SHADOW MIGHT FALL ON SOME OF THEM

THE PEOPLE ALSO GATHERED FROM THE TOWNS AROUND JERUSALEM BRINGING THE SICK AND THOSE AFFLICTED WITH UNCLEAN SPIRITS AND THEY WERE ALL HEALED

BUT THE HIGH PRIEST ROSE UP AND ALL WHO WERE WITH HIM THAT IS THE PARTY OF THE SADDUCEES AND FILLED WITH JEALOUSY THEY ARRESTED THE APOSTLES AND PUT THEM IN THE PUBLIC PRISON

BUT DURING THE NIGHT AN ANGEL OF THE LORD OPENED THE PRISON DOORS AND BROUGHT THEM OUT AND SAID GO AND STAND IN THE TEMPLE AND SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LIFE

 AND WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY ENTERED THE TEMPLE AT DAYBREAK AND BEGAN TO TEACH

NOW WHEN THE HIGH PRIEST CAME AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH HIM THEY CALLED TOGETHER THE COUNCIL AND ALL THE SENATE OF ISRAEL AND SENT TO THE PRISON TO HAVE THEM BROUGHT

BUT WHEN THE OFFICERS CAME THEY DID NOT FIND THEM IN THE PRISON SO THEY RETURNED AND REPORTED WE FOUND THE PRISON SECURELY LOCKED AND THE GUARDS STANDING AT THE DOORS BUT WHEN WE OPENED THEM WE FOUND NO ONE INSIDE

 NOW WHEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS HEARD THESE WORDS THEY WERE GREATLY PERPLEXED ABOUT THEM WONDERING WHAT THIS WOULD COME TO

AND SOMEONE CAME AND TOLD THEM LOOK

THE MEN WHOM YOU PUT IN PRISON ARE STANDING IN THE TEMPLE AND TEACHING THE PEOPLE

 THEN THE CAPTAIN WITH THE OFFICERS WENT AND BROUGHT THEM BUT NOT BY FORCE FOR THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING STONED BY THE PEOPLE

AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM THEY SET THEM BEFORE THE COUNCIL

AND THE HIGH PRIEST QUESTIONED THEM SAYING WE STRICTLY CHARGED YOU NOT TO TEACH IN THIS NAME YET HERE YOU HAVE FILLED JERUSALEM WITH YOUR TEACHING AND YOU INTEND TO BRING THIS MAN'S BLOOD UPON US

 BUT PETER AND THE APOSTLES ANSWERED WE MUST OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN

THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS RAISED JESUS WHOM YOU KILLED BY HANGING HIM ON A TREE

GOD EXALTED HIM AT HIS RIGHT HAND AS LEADER AND SAVIOR TO GIVE REPENTANCE TO ISRAEL AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS

AND WE ARE WITNESSES TO THESE THINGS AND SO IS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN TO THOSE WHO OBEY HIM

 WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY WERE ENRAGED AND WANTED TO KILL THEM

BUT A PHARISEE IN THE COUNCIL NAMED GAMALIEL A TEACHER OF THE LAW HELD IN HONOR BY ALL THE PEOPLE STOOD UP AND GAVE ORDERS TO PUT THE MEN OUTSIDE FOR A LITTLE WHILE

AND HE SAID TO THEM MEN OF ISRAEL TAKE CARE WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO WITH THESE MEN

FOR BEFORE THESE DAYS THEUDAS ROSE UP CLAIMING TO BE SOMEBODY AND A NUMBER OF MEN ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED JOINED HIM

HE WAS KILLED AND ALL WHO FOLLOWED HIM WERE DISPERSED AND CAME TO NOTHING

AFTER HIM JUDAS THE GALILEAN ROSE UP IN THE DAYS OF THE CENSUS AND DREW AWAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE AFTER HIM

HE TOO PERISHED AND ALL WHO FOLLOWED HIM WERE SCATTERED

SO IN THE PRESENT CASE I TELL YOU KEEP AWAY FROM THESE MEN AND LET THEM ALONE FOR IF THIS PLAN OR THIS UNDERTAKING IS OF MAN IT WILL FAIL; BUT IF IT IS OF GOD YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OVERTHROW THEM

YOU MIGHT EVEN BE FOUND OPPOSING GOD

 SO THEY TOOK HIS ADVICE AND WHEN THEY HAD CALLED IN THE APOSTLES THEY BEAT THEM AND CHARGED THEM NOT TO SPEAK IN THE NAME OF JESUS AND LET THEM GO

THEN THEY LEFT THE PRESENCE OF THE COUNCIL REJOICING THAT THEY WERE COUNTED WORTHY TO SUFFER DISHONOR FOR THE NAME

AND EVERY DAY IN THE TEMPLE AND FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE THEY DID NOT CEASE TEACHING AND PREACHING JESUS AS THE CHRIST

NOW IN THESE DAYS WHEN THE DISCIPLES WERE INCREASING IN NUMBER A COMPLAINT BY THE HELLENISTS AROSE AGAINST THE HEBREWS BECAUSE THEIR WIDOWS WERE BEING NEGLECTED IN THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION

AND THE TWELVE SUMMONED THE FULL NUMBER OF THE DISCIPLES AND SAID IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD GIVE UP PREACHING THE WORD OF GOD TO SERVE TABLES

THEREFORE BROTHERS PICK OUT FROM AMONG YOU SEVEN MEN OF GOOD REPUTE FULL OF THE SPIRIT AND OF WISDOM WHOM WE WILL APPOINT TO THIS DUTY

BUT WE WILL DEVOTE OURSELVES TO PRAYER AND TO THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD

 AND WHAT THEY SAID PLEASED THE WHOLE GATHERING AND THEY CHOSE STEPHEN A MAN FULL OF FAITH AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND PHILIP AND PROCHORUS AND NICANOR AND TIMON AND PARMENAS AND NICOLAUS A PROSELYTE OF ANTIOCH

THESE THEY SET BEFORE THE APOSTLES AND THEY PRAYED AND LAID THEIR HANDS ON THEM

AND THE WORD OF GOD CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND THE NUMBER OF THE DISCIPLES MULTIPLIED GREATLY IN JERUSALEM AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIESTS BECAME OBEDIENT TO THE FAITH

AND STEPHEN FULL OF GRACE AND POWER WAS DOING GREAT WONDERS AND SIGNS AMONG THE PEOPLE

THEN SOME OF THOSE WHO BELONGED TO THE SYNAGOGUE OF THE FREEDMEN AS IT WAS CALLED AND OF THE CYRENIANS AND OF THE ALEXANDRIANS AND OF THOSE FROM CILICIA AND ASIA ROSE UP AND DISPUTED WITH STEPHEN

BUT THEY COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE WISDOM AND THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH HE WAS SPEAKING

THEN THEY SECRETLY INSTIGATED MEN WHO SAID WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAK BLASPHEMOUS WORDS AGAINST MOSES AND GOD

 AND THEY STIRRED UP THE PEOPLE AND THE ELDERS AND THE SCRIBES AND THEY CAME UPON HIM AND SEIZED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE COUNCIL AND THEY SET UP FALSE WITNESSES WHO SAID THIS MAN NEVER CEASES TO SPEAK WORDS AGAINST THIS HOLY PLACE AND THE LAW FOR WE HAVE HEARD HIM SAY THAT THIS JESUS OF NAZARETH WILL DESTROY THIS PLACE AND WILL CHANGE THE CUSTOMS THAT MOSES DELIVERED TO US

 AND GAZING AT HIM ALL WHO SAT IN THE COUNCIL SAW THAT HIS FACE WAS LIKE THE FACE OF AN ANGEL

AND THE HIGH PRIEST SAID ARE THESE THINGS SO

 AND STEPHEN SAIDBROTHERS AND FATHERS HEAR ME

THE GOD OF GLORY APPEARED TO OUR FATHER ABRAHAM WHEN HE WAS IN MESOPOTAMIA BEFORE HE LIVED IN HARAN AND SAID TO HIM 'GO OUT FROM YOUR LAND AND FROM YOUR KINDRED AND GO INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU

' THEN HE WENT OUT FROM THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS AND LIVED IN HARAN

AND AFTER HIS FATHER DIED GOD REMOVED HIM FROM THERE INTO THIS LAND IN WHICH YOU ARE NOW LIVING

YET HE GAVE HIM NO INHERITANCE IN IT NOT EVEN A FOOT'S LENGTH BUT PROMISED TO GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION AND TO HIS OFFSPRING AFTER HIM THOUGH HE HAD NO CHILD

AND GOD SPOKE TO THIS EFFECTTHAT HIS OFFSPRING WOULD BE SOJOURNERS IN A LAND BELONGING TO OTHERS WHO WOULD ENSLAVE THEM AND AFFLICT THEM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS

'BUT I WILL JUDGE THE NATION THAT THEY SERVE' SAID GOD 'AND AFTER THAT THEY SHALL COME OUT AND WORSHIP ME IN THIS PLACE

' AND HE GAVE HIM THE COVENANT OF CIRCUMCISION

AND SO ABRAHAM BECAME THE FATHER OF ISAAC AND CIRCUMCISED HIM ON THE EIGHTH DAY AND ISAAC BECAME THE FATHER OF JACOB AND JACOB OF THE TWELVE PATRIARCHS

AND THE PATRIARCHS JEALOUS OF JOSEPH SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT; BUT GOD WAS WITH HIM AND RESCUED HIM OUT OF ALL HIS AFFLICTIONS AND GAVE HIM FAVOR AND WISDOM BEFORE PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT WHO MADE HIM RULER OVER EGYPT AND OVER ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD

NOW THERE CAME A FAMINE THROUGHOUT ALL EGYPT AND CANAAN AND GREAT AFFLICTION AND OUR FATHERS COULD FIND NO FOOD

BUT WHEN JACOB HEARD THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT HE SENT OUT OUR FATHERS ON THEIR FIRST VISIT

AND ON THE SECOND VISIT JOSEPH MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS BROTHERS AND JOSEPH'S FAMILY BECAME KNOWN TO PHARAOH

AND JOSEPH SENT AND SUMMONED JACOB HIS FATHER AND ALL HIS KINDRED SEVENTYFIVE PERSONS IN ALL

AND JACOB WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT AND HE DIED HE AND OUR FATHERS AND THEY WERE CARRIED BACK TO SHECHEM AND LAID IN THE TOMB THAT ABRAHAM HAD BOUGHT FOR A SUM OF SILVER FROM THE SONS OF HAMOR IN SHECHEM

BUT AS THE TIME OF THE PROMISE DREW NEAR WHICH GOD HAD GRANTED TO ABRAHAM THE PEOPLE INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED IN EGYPT UNTIL THERE AROSE OVER EGYPT ANOTHER KING WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH

HE DEALT SHREWDLY WITH OUR RACE AND FORCED OUR FATHERS TO EXPOSE THEIR INFANTS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE KEPT ALIVE

AT THIS TIME MOSES WAS BORN; AND HE WAS BEAUTIFUL IN GOD'S SIGHT

AND HE WAS BROUGHT UP FOR THREE MONTHS IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND WHEN HE WAS EXPOSED PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER ADOPTED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM UP AS HER OWN SON

AND MOSES WAS INSTRUCTED IN ALL THE WISDOM OF THE EGYPTIANS AND HE WAS MIGHTY IN HIS WORDS AND DEEDS

WHEN HE WAS FORTY YEARS OLD IT CAME INTO HIS HEART TO VISIT HIS BROTHERS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL

AND SEEING ONE OF THEM BEING WRONGED HE DEFENDED THE OPPRESSED MAN AND AVENGED HIM BY STRIKING DOWN THE EGYPTIAN

HE SUPPOSED THAT HIS BROTHERS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT GOD WAS GIVING THEM SALVATION BY HIS HAND BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND

AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE APPEARED TO THEM AS THEY WERE QUARRELING AND TRIED TO RECONCILE THEM SAYING 'MEN YOU ARE BROTHERS

WHY DO YOU WRONG EACH OTHER

' BUT THE MAN WHO WAS WRONGING HIS NEIGHBOR THRUST HIM ASIDE SAYING 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE OVER US

DO YOU WANT TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY

' AT THIS RETORT MOSES FLED AND BECAME AN EXILE IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN WHERE HE BECAME THE FATHER OF TWO SONS

NOW WHEN FORTY YEARS HAD PASSED AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT SINAI IN A FLAME OF FIRE IN A BUSH

WHEN MOSES SAW IT HE WAS AMAZED AT THE SIGHT AND AS HE DREW NEAR TO LOOK THERE CAME THE VOICE OF THE LORD 'I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND OF ISAAC AND OF JACOB

' AND MOSES TREMBLED AND DID NOT DARE TO LOOK

THEN THE LORD SAID TO HIM 'TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET FOR THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND

I HAVE SURELY SEEN THE AFFLICTION OF MY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN EGYPT AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANING AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM

AND NOW COME I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT

' THIS MOSES WHOM THEY REJECTED SAYING 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE

'THIS MAN GOD SENT AS BOTH RULER AND REDEEMER BY THE HAND OF THE ANGEL WHO APPEARED TO HIM IN THE BUSH

THIS MAN LED THEM OUT PERFORMING WONDERS AND SIGNS IN EGYPT AND AT THE RED SEA AND IN THE WILDERNESS FOR FORTY YEARS

THIS IS THE MOSES WHO SAID TO THE ISRAELITES 'GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BROTHERS

' THIS IS THE ONE WHO WAS IN THE CONGREGATION IN THE WILDERNESS WITH THE ANGEL WHO SPOKE TO HIM AT MOUNT SINAI AND WITH OUR FATHERS

HE RECEIVED LIVING ORACLES TO GIVE TO US

OUR FATHERS REFUSED TO OBEY HIM BUT THRUST HIM ASIDE AND IN THEIR HEARTS THEY TURNED TO EGYPT SAYING TO AARON 'MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US

AS FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM

' AND THEY MADE A CALF IN THOSE DAYS AND OFFERED A SACRIFICE TO THE IDOL AND WERE REJOICING IN THE WORKS OF THEIR HANDS

BUT GOD TURNED AWAY AND GAVE THEM OVER TO WORSHIP THE HOST OF HEAVEN AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE PROPHETS 'DID YOU BRING TO ME SLAIN BEASTS AND SACRIFICES DURING THE FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

YOU TOOK UP THE TENT OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF YOUR GOD REPHAN THE IMAGES THAT YOU MADE TO WORSHIP; AND I WILL SEND YOU INTO EXILE BEYOND BABYLON

' OUR FATHERS HAD THE TENT OF WITNESS IN THE WILDERNESS JUST AS HE WHO SPOKE TO MOSES DIRECTED HIM TO MAKE IT ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT HE HAD SEEN

OUR FATHERS IN TURN BROUGHT IT IN WITH JOSHUA WHEN THEY DISPOSSESSED THE NATIONS THAT GOD DROVE OUT BEFORE OUR FATHERS

SO IT WAS UNTIL THE DAYS OF DAVID WHO FOUND FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND ASKED TO FIND A DWELLING PLACE FOR THE GOD OF JACOB

BUT IT WAS SOLOMON WHO BUILT A HOUSE FOR HIM

YET THE MOST HIGH DOES NOT DWELL IN HOUSES MADE BY HANDS AS THE PROPHET SAYS 'HEAVEN IS MY THRONE AND THE EARTH IS MY FOOTSTOOL

WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME SAYS THE LORD OR WHAT IS THE PLACE OF MY REST

DID NOT MY HAND MAKE ALL THESE THINGS

' YOU STIFFNECKED PEOPLE UNCIRCUMCISED IN HEART AND EARS YOU ALWAYS RESIST THE HOLY SPIRIT

AS YOUR FATHERS DID SO DO YOU

WHICH OF THE PROPHETS DID NOT YOUR FATHERS PERSECUTE

AND THEY KILLED THOSE WHO ANNOUNCED BEFOREHAND THE COMING OF THE RIGHTEOUS ONE WHOM YOU HAVE NOW BETRAYED AND MURDERED YOU WHO RECEIVED THE LAW AS DELIVERED BY ANGELS AND DID NOT KEEP IT

 NOW WHEN THEY HEARD THESE THINGS THEY WERE ENRAGED AND THEY GROUND THEIR TEETH AT HIM

BUT HE FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT GAZED INTO HEAVEN AND SAW THE GLORY OF GOD AND JESUS STANDING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD

AND HE SAID BEHOLD I SEE THE HEAVENS OPENED AND THE SON OF MAN STANDING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD

 BUT THEY CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE AND STOPPED THEIR EARS AND RUSHED TOGETHER AT HIM

THEN THEY CAST HIM OUT OF THE CITY AND STONED HIM

AND THE WITNESSES LAID DOWN THEIR GARMENTS AT THE FEET OF A YOUNG MAN NAMED SAUL

AND AS THEY WERE STONING STEPHEN HE CALLED OUT LORD JESUS RECEIVE MY SPIRIT

 AND FALLING TO HIS KNEES HE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE LORD DO NOT HOLD THIS SIN AGAINST THEM

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE FELL ASLEEP

AND SAUL APPROVED OF HIS EXECUTION

AND THERE AROSE ON THAT DAY A GREAT PERSECUTION AGAINST THE CHURCH IN JERUSALEM AND THEY WERE ALL SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS OF JUDEA AND SAMARIA EXCEPT THE APOSTLES

DEVOUT MEN BURIED STEPHEN AND MADE GREAT LAMENTATION OVER HIM

BUT SAUL WAS RAVAGING THE CHURCH AND ENTERING HOUSE AFTER HOUSE HE DRAGGED OFF MEN AND WOMEN AND COMMITTED THEM TO PRISON

NOW THOSE WHO WERE SCATTERED WENT ABOUT PREACHING THE WORD

PHILIP WENT DOWN TO THE CITY OF SAMARIA AND PROCLAIMED TO THEM THE CHRIST

AND THE CROWDS WITH ONE ACCORD PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID BY PHILIP WHEN THEY HEARD HIM AND SAW THE SIGNS THAT HE DID

FOR UNCLEAN SPIRITS CAME OUT OF MANY WHO WERE POSSESSED CRYING WITH A LOUD VOICE AND MANY WHO WERE PARALYZED OR LAME WERE HEALED

SO THERE WAS MUCH JOY IN THAT CITY

BUT THERE WAS A MAN NAMED SIMON WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY PRACTICED MAGIC IN THE CITY AND AMAZED THE PEOPLE OF SAMARIA SAYING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SOMEBODY GREAT

THEY ALL PAID ATTENTION TO HIM FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST SAYING THIS MAN IS THE POWER OF GOD THAT IS CALLED GREAT

 AND THEY PAID ATTENTION TO HIM BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD AMAZED THEM WITH HIS MAGIC

BUT WHEN THEY BELIEVED PHILIP AS HE PREACHED GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST THEY WERE BAPTIZED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN

EVEN SIMON HIMSELF BELIEVED AND AFTER BEING BAPTIZED HE CONTINUED WITH PHILIP

AND SEEING SIGNS AND GREAT MIRACLES PERFORMED HE WAS AMAZED

NOW WHEN THE APOSTLES AT JERUSALEM HEARD THAT SAMARIA HAD RECEIVED THE WORD OF GOD THEY SENT TO THEM PETER AND JOHN WHO CAME DOWN AND PRAYED FOR THEM THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT FOR HE HAD NOT YET FALLEN ON ANY OF THEM BUT THEY HAD ONLY BEEN BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS

THEN THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THEM AND THEY RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT

NOW WHEN SIMON SAW THAT THE SPIRIT WAS GIVEN THROUGH THE LAYING ON OF THE APOSTLES' HANDS HE OFFERED THEM MONEY SAYING GIVE ME THIS POWER ALSO SO THAT ANYONE ON WHOM I LAY MY HANDS MAY RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT

 BUT PETER SAID TO HIM MAY YOUR SILVER PERISH WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD OBTAIN THE GIFT OF GOD WITH MONEY

YOU HAVE NEITHER PART NOR LOT IN THIS MATTER FOR YOUR HEART IS NOT RIGHT BEFORE GOD

REPENT THEREFORE OF THIS WICKEDNESS OF YOURS AND PRAY TO THE LORD THAT IF POSSIBLE THE INTENT OF YOUR HEART MAY BE FORGIVEN YOU

FOR I SEE THAT YOU ARE IN THE GALL OF BITTERNESS AND IN THE BOND OF INIQUITY

 AND SIMON ANSWERED PRAY FOR ME TO THE LORD THAT NOTHING OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MAY COME UPON ME

 NOW WHEN THEY HAD TESTIFIED AND SPOKEN THE WORD OF THE LORD THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO MANY VILLAGES OF THE SAMARITANS

NOW AN ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO PHILIP RISE AND GO TOWARD THE SOUTH TO THE ROAD THAT GOES DOWN FROM JERUSALEM TO GAZA

 THIS IS A DESERT PLACE

AND HE ROSE AND WENT

AND THERE WAS AN ETHIOPIAN A EUNUCH A COURT OFFICIAL OF CANDACE QUEEN OF THE ETHIOPIANS WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF ALL HER TREASURE

HE HAD COME TO JERUSALEM TO WORSHIP AND WAS RETURNING SEATED IN HIS CHARIOT AND HE WAS READING THE PROPHET ISAIAH

AND THE SPIRIT SAID TO PHILIP GO OVER AND JOIN THIS CHARIOT

 SO PHILIP RAN TO HIM AND HEARD HIM READING ISAIAH THE PROPHET AND ASKED DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE READING

 AND HE SAID HOW CAN I UNLESS SOMEONE GUIDES ME

 AND HE INVITED PHILIP TO COME UP AND SIT WITH HIM

NOW THE PASSAGE OF THE SCRIPTURE THAT HE WAS READING WAS THIS LIKE A SHEEP HE WAS LED TO THE SLAUGHTER AND LIKE A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT SO HE OPENS NOT HIS MOUTH

IN HIS HUMILIATION JUSTICE WAS DENIED HIM

WHO CAN DESCRIBE HIS GENERATION

FOR HIS LIFE IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE EARTH

 AND THE EUNUCH SAID TO PHILIP ABOUT WHOM I ASK YOU DOES THE PROPHET SAY THIS ABOUT HIMSELF OR ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE

 THEN PHILIP OPENED HIS MOUTH AND BEGINNING WITH THIS SCRIPTURE HE TOLD HIM THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT JESUS

AND AS THEY WERE GOING ALONG THE ROAD THEY CAME TO SOME WATER AND THE EUNUCH SAID SEE HERE IS WATER

WHAT PREVENTS ME FROM BEING BAPTIZED

 SEE FOOTNOTE AND HE COMMANDED THE CHARIOT TO STOP AND THEY BOTH WENT DOWN INTO THE WATER PHILIP AND THE EUNUCH AND HE BAPTIZED HIM

AND WHEN THEY CAME UP OUT OF THE WATER THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD CARRIED PHILIP AWAY AND THE EUNUCH SAW HIM NO MORE AND WENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING

BUT PHILIP FOUND HIMSELF AT AZOTUS AND AS HE PASSED THROUGH HE PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO ALL THE TOWNS UNTIL HE CAME TO CAESAREA

BUT SAUL STILL BREATHING THREATS AND MURDER AGAINST THE DISCIPLES OF THE LORD WENT TO THE HIGH PRIEST AND ASKED HIM FOR LETTERS TO THE SYNAGOGUES AT DAMASCUS SO THAT IF HE FOUND ANY BELONGING TO THE WAY MEN OR WOMEN HE MIGHT BRING THEM BOUND TO JERUSALEM

NOW AS HE WENT ON HIS WAY HE APPROACHED DAMASCUS AND SUDDENLY A LIGHT FROM HEAVEN FLASHED AROUND HIM

AND FALLING TO THE GROUND HE HEARD A VOICE SAYING TO HIM SAUL SAUL WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING ME

 AND HE SAID WHO ARE YOU LORD

 AND HE SAID I AM JESUS WHOM YOU ARE PERSECUTING

BUT RISE AND ENTER THE CITY AND YOU WILL BE TOLD WHAT YOU ARE TO DO

 THE MEN WHO WERE TRAVELING WITH HIM STOOD SPEECHLESS HEARING THE VOICE BUT SEEING NO ONE

SAUL ROSE FROM THE GROUND AND ALTHOUGH HIS EYES WERE OPENED HE SAW NOTHING

SO THEY LED HIM BY THE HAND AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DAMASCUS

AND FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS WITHOUT SIGHT AND NEITHER ATE NOR DRANK

NOW THERE WAS A DISCIPLE AT DAMASCUS NAMED ANANIAS

THE LORD SAID TO HIM IN A VISION ANANIAS

 AND HE SAID HERE I AM LORD

 AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM RISE AND GO TO THE STREET CALLED STRAIGHT AND AT THE HOUSE OF JUDAS LOOK FOR A MAN OF TARSUS NAMED SAUL FOR BEHOLD HE IS PRAYING AND HE HAS SEEN IN A VISION A MAN NAMED ANANIAS COME IN AND LAY HIS HANDS ON HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT REGAIN HIS SIGHT

 BUT ANANIAS ANSWERED LORD I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY ABOUT THIS MAN HOW MUCH EVIL HE HAS DONE TO YOUR SAINTS AT JERUSALEM

AND HERE HE HAS AUTHORITY FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS TO BIND ALL WHO CALL ON YOUR NAME

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM GO FOR HE IS A CHOSEN INSTRUMENT OF MINE TO CARRY MY NAME BEFORE THE GENTILES AND KINGS AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL

FOR I WILL SHOW HIM HOW MUCH HE MUST SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME

 SO ANANIAS DEPARTED AND ENTERED THE HOUSE

AND LAYING HIS HANDS ON HIM HE SAID BROTHER SAUL THE LORD JESUS WHO APPEARED TO YOU ON THE ROAD BY WHICH YOU CAME HAS SENT ME SO THAT YOU MAY REGAIN YOUR SIGHT AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

 AND IMMEDIATELY SOMETHING LIKE SCALES FELL FROM HIS EYES AND HE REGAINED HIS SIGHT

THEN HE ROSE AND WAS BAPTIZED; AND TAKING FOOD HE WAS STRENGTHENED

FOR SOME DAYS HE WAS WITH THE DISCIPLES AT DAMASCUS

AND IMMEDIATELY HE PROCLAIMED JESUS IN THE SYNAGOGUES SAYING HE IS THE SON OF GOD

 AND ALL WHO HEARD HIM WERE AMAZED AND SAID IS NOT THIS THE MAN WHO MADE HAVOC IN JERUSALEM OF THOSE WHO CALLED UPON THIS NAME

AND HAS HE NOT COME HERE FOR THIS PURPOSE TO BRING THEM BOUND BEFORE THE CHIEF PRIESTS

 BUT SAUL INCREASED ALL THE MORE IN STRENGTH AND CONFOUNDED THE JEWS WHO LIVED IN DAMASCUS BY PROVING THAT JESUS WAS THE CHRIST

WHEN MANY DAYS HAD PASSED THE JEWS PLOTTED TO KILL HIM BUT THEIR PLOT BECAME KNOWN TO SAUL

THEY WERE WATCHING THE GATES DAY AND NIGHT IN ORDER TO KILL HIM BUT HIS DISCIPLES TOOK HIM BY NIGHT AND LET HIM DOWN THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE WALL LOWERING HIM IN A BASKET

AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO JERUSALEM HE ATTEMPTED TO JOIN THE DISCIPLES

AND THEY WERE ALL AFRAID OF HIM FOR THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A DISCIPLE

BUT BARNABAS TOOK HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE APOSTLES AND DECLARED TO THEM HOW ON THE ROAD HE HAD SEEN THE LORD WHO SPOKE TO HIM AND HOW AT DAMASCUS HE HAD PREACHED BOLDLY IN THE NAME OF JESUS

SO HE WENT IN AND OUT AMONG THEM AT JERUSALEM PREACHING BOLDLY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND HE SPOKE AND DISPUTED AGAINST THE HELLENISTS

BUT THEY WERE SEEKING TO KILL HIM

AND WHEN THE BROTHERS LEARNED THIS THEY BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO CAESAREA AND SENT HIM OFF TO TARSUS

SO THE CHURCH THROUGHOUT ALL JUDEA AND GALILEE AND SAMARIA HAD PEACE AND WAS BEING BUILT UP

AND WALKING IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD AND IN THE COMFORT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IT MULTIPLIED

NOW AS PETER WENT HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM ALL HE CAME DOWN ALSO TO THE SAINTS WHO LIVED AT LYDDA

THERE HE FOUND A MAN NAMED AENEAS BEDRIDDEN FOR EIGHT YEARS WHO WAS PARALYZED

AND PETER SAID TO HIM AENEAS JESUS CHRIST HEALS YOU; RISE AND MAKE YOUR BED

 AND IMMEDIATELY HE ROSE

AND ALL THE RESIDENTS OF LYDDA AND SHARON SAW HIM AND THEY TURNED TO THE LORD

NOW THERE WAS IN JOPPA A DISCIPLE NAMED TABITHA WHICH TRANSLATED MEANS DORCAS

SHE WAS FULL OF GOOD WORKS AND ACTS OF CHARITY

IN THOSE DAYS SHE BECAME ILL AND DIED AND WHEN THEY HAD WASHED HER THEY LAID HER IN AN UPPER ROOM

SINCE LYDDA WAS NEAR JOPPA THE DISCIPLES HEARING THAT PETER WAS THERE SENT TWO MEN TO HIM URGING HIM PLEASE COME TO US WITHOUT DELAY

 SO PETER ROSE AND WENT WITH THEM

AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THEY TOOK HIM TO THE UPPER ROOM

ALL THE WIDOWS STOOD BESIDE HIM WEEPING AND SHOWING TUNICS AND OTHER GARMENTS THAT DORCAS MADE WHILE SHE WAS WITH THEM

BUT PETER PUT THEM ALL OUTSIDE AND KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED; AND TURNING TO THE BODY HE SAID TABITHA ARISE

 AND SHE OPENED HER EYES AND WHEN SHE SAW PETER SHE SAT UP

AND HE GAVE HER HIS HAND AND RAISED HER UP

THEN CALLING THE SAINTS AND WIDOWS HE PRESENTED HER ALIVE

AND IT BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL JOPPA AND MANY BELIEVED IN THE LORD

AND HE STAYED IN JOPPA FOR MANY DAYS WITH ONE SIMON A TANNER

AT CAESAREA THERE WAS A MAN NAMED CORNELIUS A CENTURION OF WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE ITALIAN COHORT A DEVOUT MAN WHO FEARED GOD WITH ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD GAVE ALMS GENEROUSLY TO THE PEOPLE AND PRAYED CONTINUALLY TO GOD

ABOUT THE NINTH HOUR OF THE DAY HE SAW CLEARLY IN A VISION AN ANGEL OF GOD COME IN AND SAY TO HIM CORNELIUS

 AND HE STARED AT HIM IN TERROR AND SAID WHAT IS IT LORD

 AND HE SAID TO HIM YOUR PRAYERS AND YOUR ALMS HAVE ASCENDED AS A MEMORIAL BEFORE GOD

AND NOW SEND MEN TO JOPPA AND BRING ONE SIMON WHO IS CALLED PETER

HE IS LODGING WITH ONE SIMON A TANNER WHOSE HOUSE IS BY THE SEASIDE

 WHEN THE ANGEL WHO SPOKE TO HIM HAD DEPARTED HE CALLED TWO OF HIS SERVANTS AND A DEVOUT SOLDIER FROM AMONG THOSE WHO ATTENDED HIM AND HAVING RELATED EVERYTHING TO THEM HE SENT THEM TO JOPPA

THE NEXT DAY AS THEY WERE ON THEIR JOURNEY AND APPROACHING THE CITY PETER WENT UP ON THE HOUSETOP ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR TO PRAY

AND HE BECAME HUNGRY AND WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT BUT WHILE THEY WERE PREPARING IT HE FELL INTO A TRANCE AND SAW THE HEAVENS OPENED AND SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT SHEET DESCENDING BEING LET DOWN BY ITS FOUR CORNERS UPON THE EARTH

IN IT WERE ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS AND REPTILES AND BIRDS OF THE AIR

AND THERE CAME A VOICE TO HIM RISE PETER; KILL AND EAT

 BUT PETER SAID BY NO MEANS LORD; FOR I HAVE NEVER EATEN ANYTHING THAT IS COMMON OR UNCLEAN

 AND THE VOICE CAME TO HIM AGAIN A SECOND TIME WHAT GOD HAS MADE CLEAN DO NOT CALL COMMON

 THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES AND THE THING WAS TAKEN UP AT ONCE TO HEAVEN

NOW WHILE PETER WAS INWARDLY PERPLEXED AS TO WHAT THE VISION THAT HE HAD SEEN MIGHT MEAN BEHOLD THE MEN WHO WERE SENT BY CORNELIUS HAVING MADE INQUIRY FOR SIMON'S HOUSE STOOD AT THE GATE AND CALLED OUT TO ASK WHETHER SIMON WHO WAS CALLED PETER WAS LODGING THERE

AND WHILE PETER WAS PONDERING THE VISION THE SPIRIT SAID TO HIM BEHOLD THREE MEN ARE LOOKING FOR YOU

RISE AND GO DOWN AND ACCOMPANY THEM WITHOUT HESITATION FOR I HAVE SENT THEM

 AND PETER WENT DOWN TO THE MEN AND SAID I AM THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR COMING

 AND THEY SAID CORNELIUS A CENTURION AN UPRIGHT AND GODFEARING MAN WHO IS WELL SPOKEN OF BY THE WHOLE JEWISH NATION WAS DIRECTED BY A HOLY ANGEL TO SEND FOR YOU TO COME TO HIS HOUSE AND TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY

 SO HE INVITED THEM IN TO BE HIS GUESTS

THE NEXT DAY HE ROSE AND WENT AWAY WITH THEM AND SOME OF THE BROTHERS FROM JOPPA ACCOMPANIED HIM

AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY ENTERED CAESAREA

CORNELIUS WAS EXPECTING THEM AND HAD CALLED TOGETHER HIS RELATIVES AND CLOSE FRIENDS

WHEN PETER ENTERED CORNELIUS MET HIM AND FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND WORSHIPED HIM

BUT PETER LIFTED HIM UP SAYING STAND UP; I TOO AM A MAN

 AND AS HE TALKED WITH HIM HE WENT IN AND FOUND MANY PERSONS GATHERED

AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU YOURSELVES KNOW HOW UNLAWFUL IT IS FOR A JEW TO ASSOCIATE WITH OR TO VISIT ANYONE OF ANOTHER NATION BUT GOD HAS SHOWN ME THAT I SHOULD NOT CALL ANY PERSON COMMON OR UNCLEAN

SO WHEN I WAS SENT FOR I CAME WITHOUT OBJECTION

I ASK THEN WHY YOU SENT FOR ME

 AND CORNELIUS SAID FOUR DAYS AGO ABOUT THIS HOUR I WAS PRAYING IN MY HOUSE AT THE NINTH HOUR AND BEHOLD A MAN STOOD BEFORE ME IN BRIGHT CLOTHING AND SAID 'CORNELIUS YOUR PRAYER HAS BEEN HEARD AND YOUR ALMS HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED BEFORE GOD

SEND THEREFORE TO JOPPA AND ASK FOR SIMON WHO IS CALLED PETER

HE IS LODGING IN THE HOUSE OF SIMON A TANNER BY THE SEA

' SO I SENT FOR YOU AT ONCE AND YOU HAVE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO COME

NOW THEREFORE WE ARE ALL HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TO HEAR ALL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN COMMANDED BY THE LORD

 SO PETER OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SAID TRULY I UNDERSTAND THAT GOD SHOWS NO PARTIALITY BUT IN EVERY NATION ANYONE WHO FEARS HIM AND DOES WHAT IS RIGHT IS ACCEPTABLE TO HIM

AS FOR THE WORD THAT HE SENT TO ISRAEL PREACHING GOOD NEWS OF PEACE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST HE IS LORD OF ALL YOU YOURSELVES KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT ALL JUDEA BEGINNING FROM GALILEE AFTER THE BAPTISM THAT JOHN PROCLAIMED HOW GOD ANOINTED JESUS OF NAZARETH WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND WITH POWER

HE WENT ABOUT DOING GOOD AND HEALING ALL WHO WERE OPPRESSED BY THE DEVIL FOR GOD WAS WITH HIM

AND WE ARE WITNESSES OF ALL THAT HE DID BOTH IN THE COUNTRY OF THE JEWS AND IN JERUSALEM

THEY PUT HIM TO DEATH BY HANGING HIM ON A TREE BUT GOD RAISED HIM ON THE THIRD DAY AND MADE HIM TO APPEAR NOT TO ALL THE PEOPLE BUT TO US WHO HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY GOD AS WITNESSES WHO ATE AND DRANK WITH HIM AFTER HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD

AND HE COMMANDED US TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE AND TO TESTIFY THAT HE IS THE ONE APPOINTED BY GOD TO BE JUDGE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD

TO HIM ALL THE PROPHETS BEAR WITNESS THAT EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM RECEIVES FORGIVENESS OF SINS THROUGH HIS NAME

 WHILE PETER WAS STILL SAYING THESE THINGS THE HOLY SPIRIT FELL ON ALL WHO HEARD THE WORD

AND THE BELIEVERS FROM AMONG THE CIRCUMCISED WHO HAD COME WITH PETER WERE AMAZED BECAUSE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS POURED OUT EVEN ON THE GENTILES

FOR THEY WERE HEARING THEM SPEAKING IN TONGUES AND EXTOLLING GOD

THEN PETER DECLARED CAN ANYONE WITHHOLD WATER FOR BAPTIZING THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT JUST AS WE HAVE

 AND HE COMMANDED THEM TO BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST

THEN THEY ASKED HIM TO REMAIN FOR SOME DAYS

NOW THE APOSTLES AND THE BROTHERS WHO WERE THROUGHOUT JUDEA HEARD THAT THE GENTILES ALSO HAD RECEIVED THE WORD OF GOD

SO WHEN PETER WENT UP TO JERUSALEM THE CIRCUMCISION PARTY CRITICIZED HIM SAYING YOU WENT TO UNCIRCUMCISED MEN AND ATE WITH THEM

 BUT PETER BEGAN AND EXPLAINED IT TO THEM IN ORDER I WAS IN THE CITY OF JOPPA PRAYING AND IN A TRANCE I SAW A VISION SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT SHEET DESCENDING BEING LET DOWN FROM HEAVEN BY ITS FOUR CORNERS AND IT CAME DOWN TO ME

LOOKING AT IT CLOSELY I OBSERVED ANIMALS AND BEASTS OF PREY AND REPTILES AND BIRDS OF THE AIR

AND I HEARD A VOICE SAYING TO ME 'RISE PETER; KILL AND EAT

' BUT I SAID 'BY NO MEANS LORD; FOR NOTHING COMMON OR UNCLEAN HAS EVER ENTERED MY MOUTH

' BUT THE VOICE ANSWERED A SECOND TIME FROM HEAVEN 'WHAT GOD HAS MADE CLEAN DO NOT CALL COMMON

' THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES AND ALL WAS DRAWN UP AGAIN INTO HEAVEN

AND BEHOLD AT THAT VERY MOMENT THREE MEN ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE IN WHICH WE WERE SENT TO ME FROM CAESAREA

AND THE SPIRIT TOLD ME TO GO WITH THEM MAKING NO DISTINCTION

THESE SIX BROTHERS ALSO ACCOMPANIED ME AND WE ENTERED THE MAN'S HOUSE

AND HE TOLD US HOW HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL STAND IN HIS HOUSE AND SAY 'SEND TO JOPPA AND BRING SIMON WHO IS CALLED PETER; HE WILL DECLARE TO YOU A MESSAGE BY WHICH YOU WILL BE SAVED YOU AND ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD

' AS I BEGAN TO SPEAK THE HOLY SPIRIT FELL ON THEM JUST AS ON US AT THE BEGINNING

AND I REMEMBERED THE WORD OF THE LORD HOW HE SAID 'JOHN BAPTIZED WITH WATER BUT YOU WILL BE BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

' IF THEN GOD GAVE THE SAME GIFT TO THEM AS HE GAVE TO US WHEN WE BELIEVED IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO WAS I THAT I COULD STAND IN GOD'S WAY

 WHEN THEY HEARD THESE THINGS THEY FELL SILENT

AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD SAYING THEN TO THE GENTILES ALSO GOD HAS GRANTED REPENTANCE THAT LEADS TO LIFE

 NOW THOSE WHO WERE SCATTERED BECAUSE OF THE PERSECUTION THAT AROSE OVER STEPHEN TRAVELED AS FAR AS PHOENICIA AND CYPRUS AND ANTIOCH SPEAKING THE WORD TO NO ONE EXCEPT JEWS

BUT THERE WERE SOME OF THEM MEN OF CYPRUS AND CYRENE WHO ON COMING TO ANTIOCH SPOKE TO THE HELLENISTS ALSO PREACHING THE LORD JESUS

AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS WITH THEM AND A GREAT NUMBER WHO BELIEVED TURNED TO THE LORD

THE REPORT OF THIS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE CHURCH IN JERUSALEM AND THEY SENT BARNABAS TO ANTIOCH

WHEN HE CAME AND SAW THE GRACE OF GOD HE WAS GLAD AND HE EXHORTED THEM ALL TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THE LORD WITH STEADFAST PURPOSE FOR HE WAS A GOOD MAN FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND OF FAITH

AND A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WERE ADDED TO THE LORD

SO BARNABAS WENT TO TARSUS TO LOOK FOR SAUL AND WHEN HE HAD FOUND HIM HE BROUGHT HIM TO ANTIOCH

FOR A WHOLE YEAR THEY MET WITH THE CHURCH AND TAUGHT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE

AND IN ANTIOCH THE DISCIPLES WERE FIRST CALLED CHRISTIANS

NOW IN THESE DAYS PROPHETS CAME DOWN FROM JERUSALEM TO ANTIOCH

AND ONE OF THEM NAMED AGABUS STOOD UP AND FORETOLD BY THE SPIRIT THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREAT FAMINE OVER ALL THE WORLD THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE DAYS OF CLAUDIUS

SO THE DISCIPLES DETERMINED EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY TO SEND RELIEF TO THE BROTHERS LIVING IN JUDEA

AND THEY DID SO SENDING IT TO THE ELDERS BY THE HAND OF BARNABAS AND SAUL

ABOUT THAT TIME HEROD THE KING LAID VIOLENT HANDS ON SOME WHO BELONGED TO THE CHURCH

HE KILLED JAMES THE BROTHER OF JOHN WITH THE SWORD AND WHEN HE SAW THAT IT PLEASED THE JEWS HE PROCEEDED TO ARREST PETER ALSO

THIS WAS DURING THE DAYS OF UNLEAVENED BREAD

AND WHEN HE HAD SEIZED HIM HE PUT HIM IN PRISON DELIVERING HIM OVER TO FOUR SQUADS OF SOLDIERS TO GUARD HIM INTENDING AFTER THE PASSOVER TO BRING HIM OUT TO THE PEOPLE

SO PETER WAS KEPT IN PRISON BUT EARNEST PRAYER FOR HIM WAS MADE TO GOD BY THE CHURCH

NOW WHEN HEROD WAS ABOUT TO BRING HIM OUT ON THAT VERY NIGHT PETER WAS SLEEPING BETWEEN TWO SOLDIERS BOUND WITH TWO CHAINS AND SENTRIES BEFORE THE DOOR WERE GUARDING THE PRISON

AND BEHOLD AN ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD NEXT TO HIM AND A LIGHT SHONE IN THE CELL

HE STRUCK PETER ON THE SIDE AND WOKE HIM SAYING GET UP QUICKLY

 AND THE CHAINS FELL OFF HIS HANDS

AND THE ANGEL SAID TO HIM DRESS YOURSELF AND PUT ON YOUR SANDALS

 AND HE DID SO

AND HE SAID TO HIM WRAP YOUR CLOAK AROUND YOU AND FOLLOW ME

 AND HE WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED HIM

HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WHAT WAS BEING DONE BY THE ANGEL WAS REAL BUT THOUGHT HE WAS SEEING A VISION

WHEN THEY HAD PASSED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND GUARD THEY CAME TO THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE CITY

IT OPENED FOR THEM OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND THEY WENT OUT AND WENT ALONG ONE STREET AND IMMEDIATELY THE ANGEL LEFT HIM

WHEN PETER CAME TO HIMSELF HE SAID NOW I AM SURE THAT THE LORD HAS SENT HIS ANGEL AND RESCUED ME FROM THE HAND OF HEROD AND FROM ALL THAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING

 WHEN HE REALIZED THIS HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF MARY THE MOTHER OF JOHN WHOSE OTHER NAME WAS MARK WHERE MANY WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND WERE PRAYING

AND WHEN HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE GATEWAY A SERVANT GIRL NAMED RHODA CAME TO ANSWER

RECOGNIZING PETER'S VOICE IN HER JOY SHE DID NOT OPEN THE GATE BUT RAN IN AND REPORTED THAT PETER WAS STANDING AT THE GATE

THEY SAID TO HER YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND

 BUT SHE KEPT INSISTING THAT IT WAS SO AND THEY KEPT SAYING IT IS HIS ANGEL

 BUT PETER CONTINUED KNOCKING AND WHEN THEY OPENED THEY SAW HIM AND WERE AMAZED

BUT MOTIONING TO THEM WITH HIS HAND TO BE SILENT HE DESCRIBED TO THEM HOW THE LORD HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE PRISON

AND HE SAID TELL THESE THINGS TO JAMES AND TO THE BROTHERS

 THEN HE DEPARTED AND WENT TO ANOTHER PLACE

NOW WHEN DAY CAME THERE WAS NO LITTLE DISTURBANCE AMONG THE SOLDIERS OVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF PETER

AND AFTER HEROD SEARCHED FOR HIM AND DID NOT FIND HIM HE EXAMINED THE SENTRIES AND ORDERED THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH

THEN HE WENT DOWN FROM JUDEA TO CAESAREA AND SPENT TIME THERE

NOW HEROD WAS ANGRY WITH THE PEOPLE OF TYRE AND SIDON AND THEY CAME TO HIM WITH ONE ACCORD AND HAVING PERSUADED BLASTUS THE KING'S CHAMBERLAIN THEY ASKED FOR PEACE BECAUSE THEIR COUNTRY DEPENDED ON THE KING'S COUNTRY FOR FOOD

ON AN APPOINTED DAY HEROD PUT ON HIS ROYAL ROBES TOOK HIS SEAT UPON THE THRONE AND DELIVERED AN ORATION TO THEM

AND THE PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING THE VOICE OF A GOD AND NOT OF A MAN

 IMMEDIATELY AN ANGEL OF THE LORD STRUCK HIM DOWN BECAUSE HE DID NOT GIVE GOD THE GLORY AND HE WAS EATEN BY WORMS AND BREATHED HIS LAST

BUT THE WORD OF GOD INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED

AND BARNABAS AND SAUL RETURNED FROM JERUSALEM WHEN THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR SERVICE BRINGING WITH THEM JOHN WHOSE OTHER NAME WAS MARK

NOW THERE WERE IN THE CHURCH AT ANTIOCH PROPHETS AND TEACHERS BARNABAS SIMEON WHO WAS CALLED NIGER LUCIUS OF CYRENE MANAEN A MEMBER OF THE COURT OF HEROD THE TETRARCH AND SAUL

WHILE THEY WERE WORSHIPING THE LORD AND FASTING THE HOLY SPIRIT SAID SET APART FOR ME BARNABAS AND SAUL FOR THE WORK TO WHICH I HAVE CALLED THEM

 THEN AFTER FASTING AND PRAYING THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THEM AND SENT THEM OFF

SO BEING SENT OUT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT THEY WENT DOWN TO SELEUCIA AND FROM THERE THEY SAILED TO CYPRUS

WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT SALAMIS THEY PROCLAIMED THE WORD OF GOD IN THE SYNAGOGUES OF THE JEWS

AND THEY HAD JOHN TO ASSIST THEM

WHEN THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE ISLAND AS FAR AS PAPHOS THEY CAME UPON A CERTAIN MAGICIAN A JEWISH FALSE PROPHET NAMED BARJESUS

HE WAS WITH THE PROCONSUL SERGIUS PAULUS A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE WHO SUMMONED BARNABAS AND SAUL AND SOUGHT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD

BUT ELYMAS THE MAGICIAN FOR THAT IS THE MEANING OF HIS NAME OPPOSED THEM SEEKING TO TURN THE PROCONSUL AWAY FROM THE FAITH

BUT SAUL WHO WAS ALSO CALLED PAUL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIM AND SAID YOU SON OF THE DEVIL YOU ENEMY OF ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS FULL OF ALL DECEIT AND VILLAINY WILL YOU NOT STOP MAKING CROOKED THE STRAIGHT PATHS OF THE LORD

AND NOW BEHOLD THE HAND OF THE LORD IS UPON YOU AND YOU WILL BE BLIND AND UNABLE TO SEE THE SUN FOR A TIME

 IMMEDIATELY MIST AND DARKNESS FELL UPON HIM AND HE WENT ABOUT SEEKING PEOPLE TO LEAD HIM BY THE HAND

THEN THE PROCONSUL BELIEVED WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAD OCCURRED FOR HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THE TEACHING OF THE LORD

NOW PAUL AND HIS COMPANIONS SET SAIL FROM PAPHOS AND CAME TO PERGA IN PAMPHYLIA

AND JOHN LEFT THEM AND RETURNED TO JERUSALEM BUT THEY WENT ON FROM PERGA AND CAME TO ANTIOCH IN PISIDIA

AND ON THE SABBATH DAY THEY WENT INTO THE SYNAGOGUE AND SAT DOWN

AFTER THE READING FROM THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS THE RULERS OF THE SYNAGOGUE SENT A MESSAGE TO THEM SAYING BROTHERS IF YOU HAVE ANY WORD OF EXHORTATION FOR THE PEOPLE SAY IT

 SO PAUL STOOD UP AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND SAIDMEN OF ISRAEL AND YOU WHO FEAR GOD LISTEN

THE GOD OF THIS PEOPLE ISRAEL CHOSE OUR FATHERS AND MADE THE PEOPLE GREAT DURING THEIR STAY IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND WITH UPLIFTED ARM HE LED THEM OUT OF IT

AND FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS HE PUT UP WITH THEM IN THE WILDERNESS

AND AFTER DESTROYING SEVEN NATIONS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN HE GAVE THEM THEIR LAND AS AN INHERITANCE

ALL THIS TOOK ABOUT  YEARS

AND AFTER THAT HE GAVE THEM JUDGES UNTIL SAMUEL THE PROPHET

THEN THEY ASKED FOR A KING AND GOD GAVE THEM SAUL THE SON OF KISH A MAN OF THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN FOR FORTY YEARS

AND WHEN HE HAD REMOVED HIM HE RAISED UP DAVID TO BE THEIR KING OF WHOM HE TESTIFIED AND SAID 'I HAVE FOUND IN DAVID THE SON OF JESSE A MAN AFTER MY HEART WHO WILL DO ALL MY WILL

' OF THIS MAN'S OFFSPRING GOD HAS BROUGHT TO ISRAEL A SAVIOR JESUS AS HE PROMISED

BEFORE HIS COMING JOHN HAD PROCLAIMED A BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND AS JOHN WAS FINISHING HIS COURSE HE SAID 'WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I AM

I AM NOT HE

NO BUT BEHOLD AFTER ME ONE IS COMING THE SANDALS OF WHOSE FEET I AM NOT WORTHY TO UNTIE

' BROTHERS SONS OF THE FAMILY OF ABRAHAM AND THOSE AMONG YOU WHO FEAR GOD TO US HAS BEEN SENT THE MESSAGE OF THIS SALVATION

FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN JERUSALEM AND THEIR RULERS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM NOR UNDERSTAND THE UTTERANCES OF THE PROPHETS WHICH ARE READ EVERY SABBATH FULFILLED THEM BY CONDEMNING HIM

AND THOUGH THEY FOUND IN HIM NO GUILT WORTHY OF DEATH THEY ASKED PILATE TO HAVE HIM EXECUTED

AND WHEN THEY HAD CARRIED OUT ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN OF HIM THEY TOOK HIM DOWN FROM THE TREE AND LAID HIM IN A TOMB

BUT GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD AND FOR MANY DAYS HE APPEARED TO THOSE WHO HAD COME UP WITH HIM FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM WHO ARE NOW HIS WITNESSES TO THE PEOPLE

AND WE BRING YOU THE GOOD NEWS THAT WHAT GOD PROMISED TO THE FATHERS THIS HE HAS FULFILLED TO US THEIR CHILDREN BY RAISING JESUS AS ALSO IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SECOND PSALM 'YOU ARE MY SON TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU

' AND AS FOR THE FACT THAT HE RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD NO MORE TO RETURN TO CORRUPTION HE HAS SPOKEN IN THIS WAY 'I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY AND SURE BLESSINGS OF DAVID

' THEREFORE HE SAYS ALSO IN ANOTHER PSALM 'YOU WILL NOT LET YOUR HOLY ONE SEE CORRUPTION

' FOR DAVID AFTER HE HAD SERVED THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN HIS OWN GENERATION FELL ASLEEP AND WAS LAID WITH HIS FATHERS AND SAW CORRUPTION BUT HE WHOM GOD RAISED UP DID NOT SEE CORRUPTION

LET IT BE KNOWN TO YOU THEREFORE BROTHERS THAT THROUGH THIS MAN FORGIVENESS OF SINS IS PROCLAIMED TO YOU AND BY HIM EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IS FREED FROM EVERYTHING FROM WHICH YOU COULD NOT BE FREED BY THE LAW OF MOSES

BEWARE THEREFORE LEST WHAT IS SAID IN THE PROPHETS SHOULD COME ABOUT 'LOOK YOU SCOFFERS BE ASTOUNDED AND PERISH; FOR I AM DOING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS A WORK THAT YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE EVEN IF ONE TELLS IT TO YOU

' AS THEY WENT OUT THE PEOPLE BEGGED THAT THESE THINGS MIGHT BE TOLD THEM THE NEXT SABBATH

AND AFTER THE MEETING OF THE SYNAGOGUE BROKE UP MANY JEWS AND DEVOUT CONVERTS TO JUDAISM FOLLOWED PAUL AND BARNABAS WHO AS THEY SPOKE WITH THEM URGED THEM TO CONTINUE IN THE GRACE OF GOD

THE NEXT SABBATH ALMOST THE WHOLE CITY GATHERED TO HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

BUT WHEN THE JEWS SAW THE CROWDS THEY WERE FILLED WITH JEALOUSY AND BEGAN TO CONTRADICT WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY PAUL REVILING HIM

AND PAUL AND BARNABAS SPOKE OUT BOLDLY SAYING IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE WORD OF GOD BE SPOKEN FIRST TO YOU

SINCE YOU THRUST IT ASIDE AND JUDGE YOURSELVES UNWORTHY OF ETERNAL LIFE BEHOLD WE ARE TURNING TO THE GENTILES

FOR SO THE LORD HAS COMMANDED US SAYING 'I HAVE MADE YOU A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

' AND WHEN THE GENTILES HEARD THIS THEY BEGAN REJOICING AND GLORIFYING THE WORD OF THE LORD AND AS MANY AS WERE APPOINTED TO ETERNAL LIFE BELIEVED

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD WAS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE REGION

BUT THE JEWS INCITED THE DEVOUT WOMEN OF HIGH STANDING AND THE LEADING MEN OF THE CITY STIRRED UP PERSECUTION AGAINST PAUL AND BARNABAS AND DROVE THEM OUT OF THEIR DISTRICT

BUT THEY SHOOK OFF THE DUST FROM THEIR FEET AGAINST THEM AND WENT TO ICONIUM

AND THE DISCIPLES WERE FILLED WITH JOY AND WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

NOW AT ICONIUM THEY ENTERED TOGETHER INTO THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE AND SPOKE IN SUCH A WAY THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS BELIEVED

BUT THE UNBELIEVING JEWS STIRRED UP THE GENTILES AND POISONED THEIR MINDS AGAINST THE BROTHERS

SO THEY REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME SPEAKING BOLDLY FOR THE LORD WHO BORE WITNESS TO THE WORD OF HIS GRACE GRANTING SIGNS AND WONDERS TO BE DONE BY THEIR HANDS

BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY WERE DIVIDED; SOME SIDED WITH THE JEWS AND SOME WITH THE APOSTLES

WHEN AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE BY BOTH GENTILES AND JEWS WITH THEIR RULERS TO MISTREAT THEM AND TO STONE THEM THEY LEARNED OF IT AND FLED TO LYSTRA AND DERBE CITIES OF LYCAONIA AND TO THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND THERE THEY CONTINUED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL

NOW AT LYSTRA THERE WAS A MAN SITTING WHO COULD NOT USE HIS FEET

HE WAS CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH AND HAD NEVER WALKED

HE LISTENED TO PAUL SPEAKING

AND PAUL LOOKING INTENTLY AT HIM AND SEEING THAT HE HAD FAITH TO BE MADE WELL SAID IN A LOUD VOICE STAND UPRIGHT ON YOUR FEET

 AND HE SPRANG UP AND BEGAN WALKING

AND WHEN THE CROWDS SAW WHAT PAUL HAD DONE THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES SAYING IN LYCAONIAN THE GODS HAVE COME DOWN TO US IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN

 BARNABAS THEY CALLED ZEUS AND PAUL HERMES BECAUSE HE WAS THE CHIEF SPEAKER

AND THE PRIEST OF ZEUS WHOSE TEMPLE WAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CITY BROUGHT OXEN AND GARLANDS TO THE GATES AND WANTED TO OFFER SACRIFICE WITH THE CROWDS

BUT WHEN THE APOSTLES BARNABAS AND PAUL HEARD OF IT THEY TORE THEIR GARMENTS AND RUSHED OUT INTO THE CROWD CRYING OUT MEN WHY ARE YOU DOING THESE THINGS

WE ALSO ARE MEN OF LIKE NATURE WITH YOU AND WE BRING YOU GOOD NEWS THAT YOU SHOULD TURN FROM THESE VAIN THINGS TO A LIVING GOD WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM

IN PAST GENERATIONS HE ALLOWED ALL THE NATIONS TO WALK IN THEIR OWN WAYS

YET HE DID NOT LEAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT WITNESS FOR HE DID GOOD BY GIVING YOU RAINS FROM HEAVEN AND FRUITFUL SEASONS SATISFYING YOUR HEARTS WITH FOOD AND GLADNESS

 EVEN WITH THESE WORDS THEY SCARCELY RESTRAINED THE PEOPLE FROM OFFERING SACRIFICE TO THEM

BUT JEWS CAME FROM ANTIOCH AND ICONIUM AND HAVING PERSUADED THE CROWDS THEY STONED PAUL AND DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE CITY SUPPOSING THAT HE WAS DEAD

BUT WHEN THE DISCIPLES GATHERED ABOUT HIM HE ROSE UP AND ENTERED THE CITY AND ON THE NEXT DAY HE WENT ON WITH BARNABAS TO DERBE

WHEN THEY HAD PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO THAT CITY AND HAD MADE MANY DISCIPLES THEY RETURNED TO LYSTRA AND TO ICONIUM AND TO ANTIOCH STRENGTHENING THE SOULS OF THE DISCIPLES ENCOURAGING THEM TO CONTINUE IN THE FAITH AND SAYING THAT THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS WE MUST ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AND WHEN THEY HAD APPOINTED ELDERS FOR THEM IN EVERY CHURCH WITH PRAYER AND FASTING THEY COMMITTED THEM TO THE LORD IN WHOM THEY HAD BELIEVED

THEN THEY PASSED THROUGH PISIDIA AND CAME TO PAMPHYLIA

AND WHEN THEY HAD SPOKEN THE WORD IN PERGA THEY WENT DOWN TO ATTALIA AND FROM THERE THEY SAILED TO ANTIOCH WHERE THEY HAD BEEN COMMENDED TO THE GRACE OF GOD FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAD FULFILLED

AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND GATHERED THE CHURCH TOGETHER THEY DECLARED ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE WITH THEM AND HOW HE HAD OPENED A DOOR OF FAITH TO THE GENTILES

AND THEY REMAINED NO LITTLE TIME WITH THE DISCIPLES

BUT SOME MEN CAME DOWN FROM JUDEA AND WERE TEACHING THE BROTHERS UNLESS YOU ARE CIRCUMCISED ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF MOSES YOU CANNOT BE SAVED

 AND AFTER PAUL AND BARNABAS HAD NO SMALL DISSENSION AND DEBATE WITH THEM PAUL AND BARNABAS AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE APPOINTED TO GO UP TO JERUSALEM TO THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS ABOUT THIS QUESTION

SO BEING SENT ON THEIR WAY BY THE CHURCH THEY PASSED THROUGH BOTH PHOENICIA AND SAMARIA DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THE CONVERSION OF THE GENTILES AND BROUGHT GREAT JOY TO ALL THE BROTHERS

WHEN THEY CAME TO JERUSALEM THEY WERE WELCOMED BY THE CHURCH AND THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS AND THEY DECLARED ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE WITH THEM

BUT SOME BELIEVERS WHO BELONGED TO THE PARTY OF THE PHARISEES ROSE UP AND SAID IT IS NECESSARY TO CIRCUMCISE THEM AND TO ORDER THEM TO KEEP THE LAW OF MOSES

 THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO CONSIDER THIS MATTER

AND AFTER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH DEBATE PETER STOOD UP AND SAID TO THEM BROTHERS YOU KNOW THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS GOD MADE A CHOICE AMONG YOU THAT BY MY MOUTH THE GENTILES SHOULD HEAR THE WORD OF THE GOSPEL AND BELIEVE

AND GOD WHO KNOWS THE HEART BORE WITNESS TO THEM BY GIVING THEM THE HOLY SPIRIT JUST AS HE DID TO US AND HE MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN US AND THEM HAVING CLEANSED THEIR HEARTS BY FAITH

NOW THEREFORE WHY ARE YOU PUTTING GOD TO THE TEST BY PLACING A YOKE ON THE NECK OF THE DISCIPLES THAT NEITHER OUR FATHERS NOR WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAR

BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE SAVED THROUGH THE GRACE OF THE LORD JESUS JUST AS THEY WILL

 AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY FELL SILENT AND THEY LISTENED TO BARNABAS AND PAUL AS THEY RELATED WHAT SIGNS AND WONDERS GOD HAD DONE THROUGH THEM AMONG THE GENTILES

AFTER THEY FINISHED SPEAKING JAMES REPLIED BROTHERS LISTEN TO ME

SIMEON HAS RELATED HOW GOD FIRST VISITED THE GENTILES TO TAKE FROM THEM A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME

AND WITH THIS THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS AGREE JUST AS IT IS WRITTEN 'AFTER THIS I WILL RETURN AND I WILL REBUILD THE TENT OF DAVID THAT HAS FALLEN; I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS AND I WILL RESTORE IT THAT THE REMNANT OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME SAYS THE LORD WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM OF OLD

' THEREFORE MY JUDGMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT TROUBLE THOSE OF THE GENTILES WHO TURN TO GOD BUT SHOULD WRITE TO THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM THE THINGS POLLUTED BY IDOLS AND FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND FROM WHAT HAS BEEN STRANGLED AND FROM BLOOD

FOR FROM ANCIENT GENERATIONS MOSES HAS HAD IN EVERY CITY THOSE WHO PROCLAIM HIM FOR HE IS READ EVERY SABBATH IN THE SYNAGOGUES

 THEN IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS WITH THE WHOLE CHURCH TO CHOOSE MEN FROM AMONG THEM AND SEND THEM TO ANTIOCH WITH PAUL AND BARNABAS

THEY SENT JUDAS CALLED BARSABBAS AND SILAS LEADING MEN AMONG THE BROTHERS WITH THE FOLLOWING LETTER THE BROTHERS BOTH THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS TO THE BROTHERS WHO ARE OF THE GENTILES IN ANTIOCH AND SYRIA AND CILICIA GREETINGS

SINCE WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME PERSONS HAVE GONE OUT FROM US AND TROUBLED YOU WITH WORDS UNSETTLING YOUR MINDS ALTHOUGH WE GAVE THEM NO INSTRUCTIONS IT HAS SEEMED GOOD TO US HAVING COME TO ONE ACCORD TO CHOOSE MEN AND SEND THEM TO YOU WITH OUR BELOVED BARNABAS AND PAUL MEN WHO HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR THE SAKE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

WE HAVE THEREFORE SENT JUDAS AND SILAS WHO THEMSELVES WILL TELL YOU THE SAME THINGS BY WORD OF MOUTH

FOR IT HAS SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AND TO US TO LAY ON YOU NO GREATER BURDEN THAN THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU ABSTAIN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SACRIFICED TO IDOLS AND FROM BLOOD AND FROM WHAT HAS BEEN STRANGLED AND FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY

IF YOU KEEP YOURSELVES FROM THESE YOU WILL DO WELL

FAREWELL

 SO WHEN THEY WERE SENT OFF THEY WENT DOWN TO ANTIOCH AND HAVING GATHERED THE CONGREGATION TOGETHER THEY DELIVERED THE LETTER

AND WHEN THEY HAD READ IT THEY REJOICED BECAUSE OF ITS ENCOURAGEMENT

AND JUDAS AND SILAS WHO WERE THEMSELVES PROPHETS ENCOURAGED AND STRENGTHENED THE BROTHERS WITH MANY WORDS

AND AFTER THEY HAD SPENT SOME TIME THEY WERE SENT OFF IN PEACE BY THE BROTHERS TO THOSE WHO HAD SENT THEM

SEE FOOTNOTE BUT PAUL AND BARNABAS REMAINED IN ANTIOCH TEACHING AND PREACHING THE WORD OF THE LORD WITH MANY OTHERS ALSO

AND AFTER SOME DAYS PAUL SAID TO BARNABAS LET US RETURN AND VISIT THE BROTHERS IN EVERY CITY WHERE WE PROCLAIMED THE WORD OF THE LORD AND SEE HOW THEY ARE

 NOW BARNABAS WANTED TO TAKE WITH THEM JOHN CALLED MARK

BUT PAUL THOUGHT BEST NOT TO TAKE WITH THEM ONE WHO HAD WITHDRAWN FROM THEM IN PAMPHYLIA AND HAD NOT GONE WITH THEM TO THE WORK

AND THERE AROSE A SHARP DISAGREEMENT SO THAT THEY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER

BARNABAS TOOK MARK WITH HIM AND SAILED AWAY TO CYPRUS BUT PAUL CHOSE SILAS AND DEPARTED HAVING BEEN COMMENDED BY THE BROTHERS TO THE GRACE OF THE LORD

AND HE WENT THROUGH SYRIA AND CILICIA STRENGTHENING THE CHURCHES

PAUL CAME ALSO TO DERBE AND TO LYSTRA

A DISCIPLE WAS THERE NAMED TIMOTHY THE SON OF A JEWISH WOMAN WHO WAS A BELIEVER BUT HIS FATHER WAS A GREEK

HE WAS WELL SPOKEN OF BY THE BROTHERS AT LYSTRA AND ICONIUM

PAUL WANTED TIMOTHY TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND HE TOOK HIM AND CIRCUMCISED HIM BECAUSE OF THE JEWS WHO WERE IN THOSE PLACES FOR THEY ALL KNEW THAT HIS FATHER WAS A GREEK

AS THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CITIES THEY DELIVERED TO THEM FOR OBSERVANCE THE DECISIONS THAT HAD BEEN REACHED BY THE APOSTLES AND ELDERS WHO WERE IN JERUSALEM

SO THE CHURCHES WERE STRENGTHENED IN THE FAITH AND THEY INCREASED IN NUMBERS DAILY

AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE REGION OF PHRYGIA AND GALATIA HAVING BEEN FORBIDDEN BY THE HOLY SPIRIT TO SPEAK THE WORD IN ASIA

AND WHEN THEY HAD COME UP TO MYSIA THEY ATTEMPTED TO GO INTO BITHYNIA BUT THE SPIRIT OF JESUS DID NOT ALLOW THEM

SO PASSING BY MYSIA THEY WENT DOWN TO TROAS

AND A VISION APPEARED TO PAUL IN THE NIGHT A MAN OF MACEDONIA WAS STANDING THERE URGING HIM AND SAYING COME OVER TO MACEDONIA AND HELP US

 AND WHEN PAUL HAD SEEN THE VISION IMMEDIATELY WE SOUGHT TO GO ON INTO MACEDONIA CONCLUDING THAT GOD HAD CALLED US TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THEM

SO SETTING SAIL FROM TROAS WE MADE A DIRECT VOYAGE TO SAMOTHRACE AND THE FOLLOWING DAY TO NEAPOLIS AND FROM THERE TO PHILIPPI WHICH IS A LEADING CITY OF THE DISTRICT OF MACEDONIA AND A ROMAN COLONY

WE REMAINED IN THIS CITY SOME DAYS

AND ON THE SABBATH DAY WE WENT OUTSIDE THE GATE TO THE RIVERSIDE WHERE WE SUPPOSED THERE WAS A PLACE OF PRAYER AND WE SAT DOWN AND SPOKE TO THE WOMEN WHO HAD COME TOGETHER

ONE WHO HEARD US WAS A WOMAN NAMED LYDIA FROM THE CITY OF THYATIRA A SELLER OF PURPLE GOODS WHO WAS A WORSHIPER OF GOD

THE LORD OPENED HER HEART TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS SAID BY PAUL

AND AFTER SHE WAS BAPTIZED AND HER HOUSEHOLD AS WELL SHE URGED US SAYING IF YOU HAVE JUDGED ME TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE LORD COME TO MY HOUSE AND STAY

 AND SHE PREVAILED UPON US

AS WE WERE GOING TO THE PLACE OF PRAYER WE WERE MET BY A SLAVE GIRL WHO HAD A SPIRIT OF DIVINATION AND BROUGHT HER OWNERS MUCH GAIN BY FORTUNETELLING

SHE FOLLOWED PAUL AND US CRYING OUT THESE MEN ARE SERVANTS OF THE MOST HIGH GOD WHO PROCLAIM TO YOU THE WAY OF SALVATION

 AND THIS SHE KEPT DOING FOR MANY DAYS

PAUL HAVING BECOME GREATLY ANNOYED TURNED AND SAID TO THE SPIRIT I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST TO COME OUT OF HER

 AND IT CAME OUT THAT VERY HOUR

BUT WHEN HER OWNERS SAW THAT THEIR HOPE OF GAIN WAS GONE THEY SEIZED PAUL AND SILAS AND DRAGGED THEM INTO THE MARKETPLACE BEFORE THE RULERS

AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM TO THE MAGISTRATES THEY SAID THESE MEN ARE JEWS AND THEY ARE DISTURBING OUR CITY

THEY ADVOCATE CUSTOMS THAT ARE NOT LAWFUL FOR US AS ROMANS TO ACCEPT OR PRACTICE

 THE CROWD JOINED IN ATTACKING THEM AND THE MAGISTRATES TORE THE GARMENTS OFF THEM AND GAVE ORDERS TO BEAT THEM WITH RODS

AND WHEN THEY HAD INFLICTED MANY BLOWS UPON THEM THEY THREW THEM INTO PRISON ORDERING THE JAILER TO KEEP THEM SAFELY

HAVING RECEIVED THIS ORDER HE PUT THEM INTO THE INNER PRISON AND FASTENED THEIR FEET IN THE STOCKS

ABOUT MIDNIGHT PAUL AND SILAS WERE PRAYING AND SINGING HYMNS TO GOD AND THE PRISONERS WERE LISTENING TO THEM AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT EARTHQUAKE SO THAT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PRISON WERE SHAKEN

AND IMMEDIATELY ALL THE DOORS WERE OPENED AND EVERYONE'S BONDS WERE UNFASTENED

WHEN THE JAILER WOKE AND SAW THAT THE PRISON DOORS WERE OPEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND WAS ABOUT TO KILL HIMSELF SUPPOSING THAT THE PRISONERS HAD ESCAPED

BUT PAUL CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE DO NOT HARM YOURSELF FOR WE ARE ALL HERE

 AND THE JAILER CALLED FOR LIGHTS AND RUSHED IN AND TREMBLING WITH FEAR HE FELL DOWN BEFORE PAUL AND SILAS

THEN HE BROUGHT THEM OUT AND SAID SIRS WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED

 AND THEY SAID BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS AND YOU WILL BE SAVED YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD

 AND THEY SPOKE THE WORD OF THE LORD TO HIM AND TO ALL WHO WERE IN HIS HOUSE

AND HE TOOK THEM THE SAME HOUR OF THE NIGHT AND WASHED THEIR WOUNDS; AND HE WAS BAPTIZED AT ONCE HE AND ALL HIS FAMILY

THEN HE BROUGHT THEM UP INTO HIS HOUSE AND SET FOOD BEFORE THEM

AND HE REJOICED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD THAT HE HAD BELIEVED IN GOD

BUT WHEN IT WAS DAY THE MAGISTRATES SENT THE POLICE SAYING LET THOSE MEN GO

 AND THE JAILER REPORTED THESE WORDS TO PAUL SAYING THE MAGISTRATES HAVE SENT TO LET YOU GO

THEREFORE COME OUT NOW AND GO IN PEACE

 BUT PAUL SAID TO THEM THEY HAVE BEATEN US PUBLICLY UNCONDEMNED MEN WHO ARE ROMAN CITIZENS AND HAVE THROWN US INTO PRISON; AND DO THEY NOW THROW US OUT SECRETLY

NO

LET THEM COME THEMSELVES AND TAKE US OUT

 THE POLICE REPORTED THESE WORDS TO THE MAGISTRATES AND THEY WERE AFRAID WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THEY WERE ROMAN CITIZENS

SO THEY CAME AND APOLOGIZED TO THEM

AND THEY TOOK THEM OUT AND ASKED THEM TO LEAVE THE CITY

SO THEY WENT OUT OF THE PRISON AND VISITED LYDIA

AND WHEN THEY HAD SEEN THE BROTHERS THEY ENCOURAGED THEM AND DEPARTED

NOW WHEN THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH AMPHIPOLIS AND APOLLONIA THEY CAME TO THESSALONICA WHERE THERE WAS A SYNAGOGUE OF THE JEWS

AND PAUL WENT IN AS WAS HIS CUSTOM AND ON THREE SABBATH DAYS HE REASONED WITH THEM FROM THE SCRIPTURES EXPLAINING AND PROVING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE CHRIST TO SUFFER AND TO RISE FROM THE DEAD AND SAYING THIS JESUS WHOM I PROCLAIM TO YOU IS THE CHRIST

 AND SOME OF THEM WERE PERSUADED AND JOINED PAUL AND SILAS AS DID A GREAT MANY OF THE DEVOUT GREEKS AND NOT A FEW OF THE LEADING WOMEN

BUT THE JEWS WERE JEALOUS AND TAKING SOME WICKED MEN OF THE RABBLE THEY FORMED A MOB SET THE CITY IN AN UPROAR AND ATTACKED THE HOUSE OF JASON SEEKING TO BRING THEM OUT TO THE CROWD

AND WHEN THEY COULD NOT FIND THEM THEY DRAGGED JASON AND SOME OF THE BROTHERS BEFORE THE CITY AUTHORITIES SHOUTING THESE MEN WHO HAVE TURNED THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN HAVE COME HERE ALSO AND JASON HAS RECEIVED THEM AND THEY ARE ALL ACTING AGAINST THE DECREES OF CAESAR SAYING THAT THERE IS ANOTHER KING JESUS

 AND THE PEOPLE AND THE CITY AUTHORITIES WERE DISTURBED WHEN THEY HEARD THESE THINGS

AND WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN MONEY AS SECURITY FROM JASON AND THE REST THEY LET THEM GO

THE BROTHERS IMMEDIATELY SENT PAUL AND SILAS AWAY BY NIGHT TO BEREA AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WENT INTO THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE

NOW THESE JEWS WERE MORE NOBLE THAN THOSE IN THESSALONICA; THEY RECEIVED THE WORD WITH ALL EAGERNESS EXAMINING THE SCRIPTURES DAILY TO SEE IF THESE THINGS WERE SO

MANY OF THEM THEREFORE BELIEVED WITH NOT A FEW GREEK WOMEN OF HIGH STANDING AS WELL AS MEN

BUT WHEN THE JEWS FROM THESSALONICA LEARNED THAT THE WORD OF GOD WAS PROCLAIMED BY PAUL AT BEREA ALSO THEY CAME THERE TOO AGITATING AND STIRRING UP THE CROWDS

THEN THE BROTHERS IMMEDIATELY SENT PAUL OFF ON HIS WAY TO THE SEA BUT SILAS AND TIMOTHY REMAINED THERE

THOSE WHO CONDUCTED PAUL BROUGHT HIM AS FAR AS ATHENS AND AFTER RECEIVING A COMMAND FOR SILAS AND TIMOTHY TO COME TO HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY DEPARTED

NOW WHILE PAUL WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT ATHENS HIS SPIRIT WAS PROVOKED WITHIN HIM AS HE SAW THAT THE CITY WAS FULL OF IDOLS

SO HE REASONED IN THE SYNAGOGUE WITH THE JEWS AND THE DEVOUT PERSONS AND IN THE MARKETPLACE EVERY DAY WITH THOSE WHO HAPPENED TO BE THERE

SOME OF THE EPICUREAN AND STOIC PHILOSOPHERS ALSO CONVERSED WITH HIM

AND SOME SAID WHAT DOES THIS BABBLER WISH TO SAY

 OTHERS SAID HE SEEMS TO BE A PREACHER OF FOREIGN DIVINITIESBECAUSE HE WAS PREACHING JESUS AND THE RESURRECTION

AND THEY TOOK HOLD OF HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE AREOPAGUS SAYING MAY WE KNOW WHAT THIS NEW TEACHING IS THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING

FOR YOU BRING SOME STRANGE THINGS TO OUR EARS

WE WISH TO KNOW THEREFORE WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN

 NOW ALL THE ATHENIANS AND THE FOREIGNERS WHO LIVED THERE WOULD SPEND THEIR TIME IN NOTHING EXCEPT TELLING OR HEARING SOMETHING NEW

SO PAUL STANDING IN THE MIDST OF THE AREOPAGUS SAID MEN OF ATHENS I PERCEIVE THAT IN EVERY WAY YOU ARE VERY RELIGIOUS

FOR AS I PASSED ALONG AND OBSERVED THE OBJECTS OF YOUR WORSHIP I FOUND ALSO AN ALTAR WITH THIS INSCRIPTION 'TO THE UNKNOWN GOD

' WHAT THEREFORE YOU WORSHIP AS UNKNOWN THIS I PROCLAIM TO YOU

THE GOD WHO MADE THE WORLD AND EVERYTHING IN IT BEING LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH DOES NOT LIVE IN TEMPLES MADE BY MAN NOR IS HE SERVED BY HUMAN HANDS AS THOUGH HE NEEDED ANYTHING SINCE HE HIMSELF GIVES TO ALL MANKIND LIFE AND BREATH AND EVERYTHING

AND HE MADE FROM ONE MAN EVERY NATION OF MANKIND TO LIVE ON ALL THE FACE OF THE EARTH HAVING DETERMINED ALLOTTED PERIODS AND THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR DWELLING PLACE THAT THEY SHOULD SEEK GOD IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT FEEL THEIR WAY TOWARD HIM AND FIND HIM

YET HE IS ACTUALLY NOT FAR FROM EACH ONE OF US FOR 'IN HIM WE LIVE AND MOVE AND HAVE OUR BEING'; AS EVEN SOME OF YOUR OWN POETS HAVE SAID 'FOR WE ARE INDEED HIS OFFSPRING

' BEING THEN GOD'S OFFSPRING WE OUGHT NOT TO THINK THAT THE DIVINE BEING IS LIKE GOLD OR SILVER OR STONE AN IMAGE FORMED BY THE ART AND IMAGINATION OF MAN

THE TIMES OF IGNORANCE GOD OVERLOOKED BUT NOW HE COMMANDS ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE TO REPENT BECAUSE HE HAS FIXED A DAY ON WHICH HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD IN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY A MAN WHOM HE HAS APPOINTED; AND OF THIS HE HAS GIVEN ASSURANCE TO ALL BY RAISING HIM FROM THE DEAD

 NOW WHEN THEY HEARD OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD SOME MOCKED

BUT OTHERS SAID WE WILL HEAR YOU AGAIN ABOUT THIS

 SO PAUL WENT OUT FROM THEIR MIDST

BUT SOME MEN JOINED HIM AND BELIEVED AMONG WHOM ALSO WERE DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE AND A WOMAN NAMED DAMARIS AND OTHERS WITH THEM

AFTER THIS PAUL LEFT ATHENS AND WENT TO CORINTH

AND HE FOUND A JEW NAMED AQUILA A NATIVE OF PONTUS RECENTLY COME FROM ITALY WITH HIS WIFE PRISCILLA BECAUSE CLAUDIUS HAD COMMANDED ALL THE JEWS TO LEAVE ROME

AND HE WENT TO SEE THEM AND BECAUSE HE WAS OF THE SAME TRADE HE STAYED WITH THEM AND WORKED FOR THEY WERE TENTMAKERS BY TRADE

AND HE REASONED IN THE SYNAGOGUE EVERY SABBATH AND TRIED TO PERSUADE JEWS AND GREEKS

WHEN SILAS AND TIMOTHY ARRIVED FROM MACEDONIA PAUL WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE WORD TESTIFYING TO THE JEWS THAT THE CHRIST WAS JESUS

AND WHEN THEY OPPOSED AND REVILED HIM HE SHOOK OUT HIS GARMENTS AND SAID TO THEM YOUR BLOOD BE ON YOUR OWN HEADS

I AM INNOCENT

FROM NOW ON I WILL GO TO THE GENTILES

 AND HE LEFT THERE AND WENT TO THE HOUSE OF A MAN NAMED TITIUS JUSTUS A WORSHIPER OF GOD

HIS HOUSE WAS NEXT DOOR TO THE SYNAGOGUE

CRISPUS THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE BELIEVED IN THE LORD TOGETHER WITH HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD

AND MANY OF THE CORINTHIANS HEARING PAUL BELIEVED AND WERE BAPTIZED

AND THE LORD SAID TO PAUL ONE NIGHT IN A VISION DO NOT BE AFRAID BUT GO ON SPEAKING AND DO NOT BE SILENT FOR I AM WITH YOU AND NO ONE WILL ATTACK YOU TO HARM YOU FOR I HAVE MANY IN THIS CITY WHO ARE MY PEOPLE

 AND HE STAYED A YEAR AND SIX MONTHS TEACHING THE WORD OF GOD AMONG THEM

BUT WHEN GALLIO WAS PROCONSUL OF ACHAIA THE JEWS MADE A UNITED ATTACK ON PAUL AND BROUGHT HIM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL SAYING THIS MAN IS PERSUADING PEOPLE TO WORSHIP GOD CONTRARY TO THE LAW

 BUT WHEN PAUL WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH GALLIO SAID TO THE JEWS IF IT WERE A MATTER OF WRONGDOING OR VICIOUS CRIME O JEWS I WOULD HAVE REASON TO ACCEPT YOUR COMPLAINT

BUT SINCE IT IS A MATTER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WORDS AND NAMES AND YOUR OWN LAW SEE TO IT YOURSELVES

I REFUSE TO BE A JUDGE OF THESE THINGS

 AND HE DROVE THEM FROM THE TRIBUNAL

AND THEY ALL SEIZED SOSTHENES THE RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE AND BEAT HIM IN FRONT OF THE TRIBUNAL

BUT GALLIO PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY OF THIS

AFTER THIS PAUL STAYED MANY DAYS LONGER AND THEN TOOK LEAVE OF THE BROTHERS AND SET SAIL FOR SYRIA AND WITH HIM PRISCILLA AND AQUILA

AT CENCHREAE HE HAD CUT HIS HAIR FOR HE WAS UNDER A VOW

AND THEY CAME TO EPHESUS AND HE LEFT THEM THERE BUT HE HIMSELF WENT INTO THE SYNAGOGUE AND REASONED WITH THE JEWS

WHEN THEY ASKED HIM TO STAY FOR A LONGER PERIOD HE DECLINED

BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HE SAID I WILL RETURN TO YOU IF GOD WILLS AND HE SET SAIL FROM EPHESUS

WHEN HE HAD LANDED AT CAESAREA HE WENT UP AND GREETED THE CHURCH AND THEN WENT DOWN TO ANTIOCH

AFTER SPENDING SOME TIME THERE HE DEPARTED AND WENT FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT THROUGH THE REGION OF GALATIA AND PHRYGIA STRENGTHENING ALL THE DISCIPLES

NOW A JEW NAMED APOLLOS A NATIVE OF ALEXANDRIA CAME TO EPHESUS

HE WAS AN ELOQUENT MAN COMPETENT IN THE SCRIPTURES

HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE WAY OF THE LORD

AND BEING FERVENT IN SPIRIT HE SPOKE AND TAUGHT ACCURATELY THE THINGS CONCERNING JESUS THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY THE BAPTISM OF JOHN

HE BEGAN TO SPEAK BOLDLY IN THE SYNAGOGUE BUT WHEN PRISCILLA AND AQUILA HEARD HIM THEY TOOK HIM AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THE WAY OF GOD MORE ACCURATELY

AND WHEN HE WISHED TO CROSS TO ACHAIA THE BROTHERS ENCOURAGED HIM AND WROTE TO THE DISCIPLES TO WELCOME HIM

WHEN HE ARRIVED HE GREATLY HELPED THOSE WHO THROUGH GRACE HAD BELIEVED FOR HE POWERFULLY REFUTED THE JEWS IN PUBLIC SHOWING BY THE SCRIPTURES THAT THE CHRIST WAS JESUS

AND IT HAPPENED THAT WHILE APOLLOS WAS AT CORINTH PAUL PASSED THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY AND CAME TO EPHESUS

THERE HE FOUND SOME DISCIPLES

AND HE SAID TO THEM DID YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT WHEN YOU BELIEVED

 AND THEY SAID NO WE HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD THAT THERE IS A HOLY SPIRIT

 AND HE SAID INTO WHAT THEN WERE YOU BAPTIZED

 THEY SAID INTO JOHN'S BAPTISM

 AND PAUL SAID JOHN BAPTIZED WITH THE BAPTISM OF REPENTANCE TELLING THE PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN THE ONE WHO WAS TO COME AFTER HIM THAT IS JESUS

 ON HEARING THIS THEY WERE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS

AND WHEN PAUL HAD LAID HIS HANDS ON THEM THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME ON THEM AND THEY BEGAN SPEAKING IN TONGUES AND PROPHESYING

THERE WERE ABOUT TWELVE MEN IN ALL

AND HE ENTERED THE SYNAGOGUE AND FOR THREE MONTHS SPOKE BOLDLY REASONING AND PERSUADING THEM ABOUT THE KINGDOM OF GOD

BUT WHEN SOME BECAME STUBBORN AND CONTINUED IN UNBELIEF SPEAKING EVIL OF THE WAY BEFORE THE CONGREGATION HE WITHDREW FROM THEM AND TOOK THE DISCIPLES WITH HIM REASONING DAILY IN THE HALL OF TYRANNUS

THIS CONTINUED FOR TWO YEARS SO THAT ALL THE RESIDENTS OF ASIA HEARD THE WORD OF THE LORD BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS

AND GOD WAS DOING EXTRAORDINARY MIRACLES BY THE HANDS OF PAUL SO THAT EVEN HANDKERCHIEFS OR APRONS THAT HAD TOUCHED HIS SKIN WERE CARRIED AWAY TO THE SICK AND THEIR DISEASES LEFT THEM AND THE EVIL SPIRITS CAME OUT OF THEM

THEN SOME OF THE ITINERANT JEWISH EXORCISTS UNDERTOOK TO INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS OVER THOSE WHO HAD EVIL SPIRITS SAYING I ADJURE YOU BY THE JESUS WHOM PAUL PROCLAIMS

 SEVEN SONS OF A JEWISH HIGH PRIEST NAMED SCEVA WERE DOING THIS

BUT THE EVIL SPIRIT ANSWERED THEM JESUS I KNOW AND PAUL I RECOGNIZE BUT WHO ARE YOU

 AND THE MAN IN WHOM WAS THE EVIL SPIRIT LEAPED ON THEM MASTERED ALL OF THEM AND OVERPOWERED THEM SO THAT THEY FLED OUT OF THAT HOUSE NAKED AND WOUNDED

AND THIS BECAME KNOWN TO ALL THE RESIDENTS OF EPHESUS BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS

AND FEAR FELL UPON THEM ALL AND THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS WAS EXTOLLED

ALSO MANY OF THOSE WHO WERE NOW BELIEVERS CAME CONFESSING AND DIVULGING THEIR PRACTICES

AND A NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAD PRACTICED MAGIC ARTS BROUGHT THEIR BOOKS TOGETHER AND BURNED THEM IN THE SIGHT OF ALL

AND THEY COUNTED THE VALUE OF THEM AND FOUND IT CAME TO FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER

SO THE WORD OF THE LORD CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND PREVAIL MIGHTILY

NOW AFTER THESE EVENTS PAUL RESOLVED IN THE SPIRIT TO PASS THROUGH MACEDONIA AND ACHAIA AND GO TO JERUSALEM SAYING AFTER I HAVE BEEN THERE I MUST ALSO SEE ROME

 AND HAVING SENT INTO MACEDONIA TWO OF HIS HELPERS TIMOTHY AND ERASTUS HE HIMSELF STAYED IN ASIA FOR A WHILE

ABOUT THAT TIME THERE AROSE NO LITTLE DISTURBANCE CONCERNING THE WAY

FOR A MAN NAMED DEMETRIUS A SILVERSMITH WHO MADE SILVER SHRINES OF ARTEMIS BROUGHT NO LITTLE BUSINESS TO THE CRAFTSMEN

THESE HE GATHERED TOGETHER WITH THE WORKMEN IN SIMILAR TRADES AND SAID MEN YOU KNOW THAT FROM THIS BUSINESS WE HAVE OUR WEALTH

AND YOU SEE AND HEAR THAT NOT ONLY IN EPHESUS BUT IN ALMOST ALL OF ASIA THIS PAUL HAS PERSUADED AND TURNED AWAY A GREAT MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT GODS MADE WITH HANDS ARE NOT GODS

AND THERE IS DANGER NOT ONLY THAT THIS TRADE OF OURS MAY COME INTO DISREPUTE BUT ALSO THAT THE TEMPLE OF THE GREAT GODDESS ARTEMIS MAY BE COUNTED AS NOTHING AND THAT SHE MAY EVEN BE DEPOSED FROM HER MAGNIFICENCE SHE WHOM ALL ASIA AND THE WORLD WORSHIP

 WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THEY WERE ENRAGED AND WERE CRYING OUT GREAT IS ARTEMIS OF THE EPHESIANS

 SO THE CITY WAS FILLED WITH THE CONFUSION AND THEY RUSHED TOGETHER INTO THE THEATER DRAGGING WITH THEM GAIUS AND ARISTARCHUS MACEDONIANS WHO WERE PAUL'S COMPANIONS IN TRAVEL

BUT WHEN PAUL WISHED TO GO IN AMONG THE CROWD THE DISCIPLES WOULD NOT LET HIM

AND EVEN SOME OF THE ASIARCHS WHO WERE FRIENDS OF HIS SENT TO HIM AND WERE URGING HIM NOT TO VENTURE INTO THE THEATER

NOW SOME CRIED OUT ONE THING SOME ANOTHER FOR THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM DID NOT KNOW WHY THEY HAD COME TOGETHER

SOME OF THE CROWD PROMPTED ALEXANDER WHOM THE JEWS HAD PUT FORWARD

AND ALEXANDER MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND WANTED TO MAKE A DEFENSE TO THE CROWD

BUT WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED THAT HE WAS A JEW FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS THEY ALL CRIED OUT WITH ONE VOICE GREAT IS ARTEMIS OF THE EPHESIANS

 AND WHEN THE TOWN CLERK HAD QUIETED THE CROWD HE SAID MEN OF EPHESUS WHO IS THERE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE CITY OF THE EPHESIANS IS TEMPLE KEEPER OF THE GREAT ARTEMIS AND OF THE SACRED STONE THAT FELL FROM THE SKY

SEEING THEN THAT THESE THINGS CANNOT BE DENIED YOU OUGHT TO BE QUIET AND DO NOTHING RASH

FOR YOU HAVE BROUGHT THESE MEN HERE WHO ARE NEITHER SACRILEGIOUS NOR BLASPHEMERS OF OUR GODDESS

IF THEREFORE DEMETRIUS AND THE CRAFTSMEN WITH HIM HAVE A COMPLAINT AGAINST ANYONE THE COURTS ARE OPEN AND THERE ARE PROCONSULS

LET THEM BRING CHARGES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER

BUT IF YOU SEEK ANYTHING FURTHER IT SHALL BE SETTLED IN THE REGULAR ASSEMBLY

FOR WE REALLY ARE IN DANGER OF BEING CHARGED WITH RIOTING TODAY SINCE THERE IS NO CAUSE THAT WE CAN GIVE TO JUSTIFY THIS COMMOTION

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE DISMISSED THE ASSEMBLY

AFTER THE UPROAR CEASED PAUL SENT FOR THE DISCIPLES AND AFTER ENCOURAGING THEM HE SAID FAREWELL AND DEPARTED FOR MACEDONIA

WHEN HE HAD GONE THROUGH THOSE REGIONS AND HAD GIVEN THEM MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT HE CAME TO GREECE

THERE HE SPENT THREE MONTHS AND WHEN A PLOT WAS MADE AGAINST HIM BY THE JEWS AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SET SAIL FOR SYRIA HE DECIDED TO RETURN THROUGH MACEDONIA

SOPATER OF BEREA THE SON OF PYRRHUS FROM BEREA ACCOMPANIED HIM; AND OF THE THESSALONIANS ARISTARCHUS AND SECUNDUS; AND GAIUS OF DERBE AND TIMOTHY; AND THE ASIANS TYCHICUS AND TROPHIMUS

THESE WENT ON AHEAD AND WERE WAITING FOR US AT TROAS BUT WE SAILED AWAY FROM PHILIPPI AFTER THE DAYS OF UNLEAVENED BREAD AND IN FIVE DAYS WE CAME TO THEM AT TROAS WHERE WE STAYED FOR SEVEN DAYS

ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK WHEN WE WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO BREAK BREAD PAUL TALKED WITH THEM INTENDING TO DEPART ON THE NEXT DAY AND HE PROLONGED HIS SPEECH UNTIL MIDNIGHT

THERE WERE MANY LAMPS IN THE UPPER ROOM WHERE WE WERE GATHERED

AND A YOUNG MAN NAMED EUTYCHUS SITTING AT THE WINDOW SANK INTO A DEEP SLEEP AS PAUL TALKED STILL LONGER

AND BEING OVERCOME BY SLEEP HE FELL DOWN FROM THE THIRD STORY AND WAS TAKEN UP DEAD

BUT PAUL WENT DOWN AND BENT OVER HIM AND TAKING HIM IN HIS ARMS SAID DO NOT BE ALARMED FOR HIS LIFE IS IN HIM

 AND WHEN PAUL HAD GONE UP AND HAD BROKEN BREAD AND EATEN HE CONVERSED WITH THEM A LONG WHILE UNTIL DAYBREAK AND SO DEPARTED

AND THEY TOOK THE YOUTH AWAY ALIVE AND WERE NOT A LITTLE COMFORTED

BUT GOING AHEAD TO THE SHIP WE SET SAIL FOR ASSOS INTENDING TO TAKE PAUL ABOARD THERE FOR SO HE HAD ARRANGED INTENDING HIMSELF TO GO BY LAND

AND WHEN HE MET US AT ASSOS WE TOOK HIM ON BOARD AND WENT TO MITYLENE

AND SAILING FROM THERE WE CAME THE FOLLOWING DAY OPPOSITE CHIOS; THE NEXT DAY WE TOUCHED AT SAMOS; AND THE DAY AFTER THAT WE WENT TO MILETUS

FOR PAUL HAD DECIDED TO SAIL PAST EPHESUS SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO SPEND TIME IN ASIA FOR HE WAS HASTENING TO BE AT JERUSALEM IF POSSIBLE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST

NOW FROM MILETUS HE SENT TO EPHESUS AND CALLED THE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH TO COME TO HIM

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO HIM HE SAID TO THEMYOU YOURSELVES KNOW HOW I LIVED AMONG YOU THE WHOLE TIME FROM THE FIRST DAY THAT I SET FOOT IN ASIA SERVING THE LORD WITH ALL HUMILITY AND WITH TEARS AND WITH TRIALS THAT HAPPENED TO ME THROUGH THE PLOTS OF THE JEWS; HOW I DID NOT SHRINK FROM DECLARING TO YOU ANYTHING THAT WAS PROFITABLE AND TEACHING YOU IN PUBLIC AND FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TESTIFYING BOTH TO JEWS AND TO GREEKS OF REPENTANCE TOWARD GOD AND OF FAITH IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

AND NOW BEHOLD I AM GOING TO JERUSALEM CONSTRAINED BY THE SPIRIT NOT KNOWING WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME THERE EXCEPT THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT TESTIFIES TO ME IN EVERY CITY THAT IMPRISONMENT AND AFFLICTIONS AWAIT ME

BUT I DO NOT ACCOUNT MY LIFE OF ANY VALUE NOR AS PRECIOUS TO MYSELF IF ONLY I MAY FINISH MY COURSE AND THE MINISTRY THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE LORD JESUS TO TESTIFY TO THE GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD

AND NOW BEHOLD I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU AMONG WHOM I HAVE GONE ABOUT PROCLAIMING THE KINGDOM WILL SEE MY FACE AGAIN

THEREFORE I TESTIFY TO YOU THIS DAY THAT I AM INNOCENT OF THE BLOOD OF ALL OF YOU FOR I DID NOT SHRINK FROM DECLARING TO YOU THE WHOLE COUNSEL OF GOD

PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO YOURSELVES AND TO ALL THE FLOCK IN WHICH THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS MADE YOU OVERSEERS TO CARE FOR THE CHURCH OF GOD WHICH HE OBTAINED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD

I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEPARTURE FIERCE WOLVES WILL COME IN AMONG YOU NOT SPARING THE FLOCK; AND FROM AMONG YOUR OWN SELVES WILL ARISE MEN SPEAKING TWISTED THINGS TO DRAW AWAY THE DISCIPLES AFTER THEM

THEREFORE BE ALERT REMEMBERING THAT FOR THREE YEARS I DID NOT CEASE NIGHT OR DAY TO ADMONISH EVERYONE WITH TEARS

AND NOW I COMMEND YOU TO GOD AND TO THE WORD OF HIS GRACE WHICH IS ABLE TO BUILD YOU UP AND TO GIVE YOU THE INHERITANCE AMONG ALL THOSE WHO ARE SANCTIFIED

I COVETED NO ONE'S SILVER OR GOLD OR APPAREL

YOU YOURSELVES KNOW THAT THESE HANDS MINISTERED TO MY NECESSITIES AND TO THOSE WHO WERE WITH ME

IN ALL THINGS I HAVE SHOWN YOU THAT BY WORKING HARD IN THIS WAY WE MUST HELP THE WEAK AND REMEMBER THE WORDS OF THE LORD JESUS HOW HE HIMSELF SAID 'IT IS MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE

' AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED WITH THEM ALL

AND THERE WAS MUCH WEEPING ON THE PART OF ALL; THEY EMBRACED PAUL AND KISSED HIM BEING SORROWFUL MOST OF ALL BECAUSE OF THE WORD HE HAD SPOKEN THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE HIS FACE AGAIN

AND THEY ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE SHIP

AND WHEN WE HAD PARTED FROM THEM AND SET SAIL WE CAME BY A STRAIGHT COURSE TO COS AND THE NEXT DAY TO RHODES AND FROM THERE TO PATARA

AND HAVING FOUND A SHIP CROSSING TO PHOENICIA WE WENT ABOARD AND SET SAIL

WHEN WE HAD COME IN SIGHT OF CYPRUS LEAVING IT ON THE LEFT WE SAILED TO SYRIA AND LANDED AT TYRE FOR THERE THE SHIP WAS TO UNLOAD ITS CARGO

AND HAVING SOUGHT OUT THE DISCIPLES WE STAYED THERE FOR SEVEN DAYS

AND THROUGH THE SPIRIT THEY WERE TELLING PAUL NOT TO GO ON TO JERUSALEM

WHEN OUR DAYS THERE WERE ENDED WE DEPARTED AND WENT ON OUR JOURNEY AND THEY ALL WITH WIVES AND CHILDREN ACCOMPANIED US UNTIL WE WERE OUTSIDE THE CITY

AND KNEELING DOWN ON THE BEACH WE PRAYED AND SAID FAREWELL TO ONE ANOTHER

THEN WE WENT ON BOARD THE SHIP AND THEY RETURNED HOME

WHEN WE HAD FINISHED THE VOYAGE FROM TYRE WE ARRIVED AT PTOLEMAIS AND WE GREETED THE BROTHERS AND STAYED WITH THEM FOR ONE DAY

ON THE NEXT DAY WE DEPARTED AND CAME TO CAESAREA AND WE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF PHILIP THE EVANGELIST WHO WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN AND STAYED WITH HIM

HE HAD FOUR UNMARRIED DAUGHTERS WHO PROPHESIED

WHILE WE WERE STAYING FOR MANY DAYS A PROPHET NAMED AGABUS CAME DOWN FROM JUDEA

AND COMING TO US HE TOOK PAUL'S BELT AND BOUND HIS OWN FEET AND HANDS AND SAID THUS SAYS THE HOLY SPIRIT 'THIS IS HOW THE JEWS AT JERUSALEM WILL BIND THE MAN WHO OWNS THIS BELT AND DELIVER HIM INTO THE HANDS OF THE GENTILES

' WHEN WE HEARD THIS WE AND THE PEOPLE THERE URGED HIM NOT TO GO UP TO JERUSALEM

THEN PAUL ANSWERED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WEEPING AND BREAKING MY HEART

FOR I AM READY NOT ONLY TO BE IMPRISONED BUT EVEN TO DIE IN JERUSALEM FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS

 AND SINCE HE WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED WE CEASED AND SAID LET THE WILL OF THE LORD BE DONE

 AFTER THESE DAYS WE GOT READY AND WENT UP TO JERUSALEM

AND SOME OF THE DISCIPLES FROM CAESAREA WENT WITH US BRINGING US TO THE HOUSE OF MNASON OF CYPRUS AN EARLY DISCIPLE WITH WHOM WE SHOULD LODGE

WHEN WE HAD COME TO JERUSALEM THE BROTHERS RECEIVED US GLADLY

ON THE FOLLOWING DAY PAUL WENT IN WITH US TO JAMES AND ALL THE ELDERS WERE PRESENT

AFTER GREETING THEM HE RELATED ONE BY ONE THE THINGS THAT GOD HAD DONE AMONG THE GENTILES THROUGH HIS MINISTRY

AND WHEN THEY HEARD IT THEY GLORIFIED GOD

AND THEY SAID TO HIM YOU SEE BROTHER HOW MANY THOUSANDS THERE ARE AMONG THE JEWS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED

THEY ARE ALL ZEALOUS FOR THE LAW AND THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT YOU THAT YOU TEACH ALL THE JEWS WHO ARE AMONG THE GENTILES TO FORSAKE MOSES TELLING THEM NOT TO CIRCUMCISE THEIR CHILDREN OR WALK ACCORDING TO OUR CUSTOMS

WHAT THEN IS TO BE DONE

THEY WILL CERTAINLY HEAR THAT YOU HAVE COME

DO THEREFORE WHAT WE TELL YOU

WE HAVE FOUR MEN WHO ARE UNDER A VOW; TAKE THESE MEN AND PURIFY YOURSELF ALONG WITH THEM AND PAY THEIR EXPENSES SO THAT THEY MAY SHAVE THEIR HEADS

THUS ALL WILL KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT YOU BUT THAT YOU YOURSELF ALSO LIVE IN OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

BUT AS FOR THE GENTILES WHO HAVE BELIEVED WE HAVE SENT A LETTER WITH OUR JUDGMENT THAT THEY SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SACRIFICED TO IDOLS AND FROM BLOOD AND FROM WHAT HAS BEEN STRANGLED AND FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY

 THEN PAUL TOOK THE MEN AND THE NEXT DAY HE PURIFIED HIMSELF ALONG WITH THEM AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE GIVING NOTICE WHEN THE DAYS OF PURIFICATION WOULD BE FULFILLED AND THE OFFERING PRESENTED FOR EACH ONE OF THEM

WHEN THE SEVEN DAYS WERE ALMOST COMPLETED THE JEWS FROM ASIA SEEING HIM IN THE TEMPLE STIRRED UP THE WHOLE CROWD AND LAID HANDS ON HIM CRYING OUT MEN OF ISRAEL HELP

THIS IS THE MAN WHO IS TEACHING EVERYONE EVERYWHERE AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE LAW AND THIS PLACE

MOREOVER HE EVEN BROUGHT GREEKS INTO THE TEMPLE AND HAS DEFILED THIS HOLY PLACE

 FOR THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN TROPHIMUS THE EPHESIAN WITH HIM IN THE CITY AND THEY SUPPOSED THAT PAUL HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO THE TEMPLE

THEN ALL THE CITY WAS STIRRED UP AND THE PEOPLE RAN TOGETHER

THEY SEIZED PAUL AND DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND AT ONCE THE GATES WERE SHUT

AND AS THEY WERE SEEKING TO KILL HIM WORD CAME TO THE TRIBUNE OF THE COHORT THAT ALL JERUSALEM WAS IN CONFUSION

HE AT ONCE TOOK SOLDIERS AND CENTURIONS AND RAN DOWN TO THEM

AND WHEN THEY SAW THE TRIBUNE AND THE SOLDIERS THEY STOPPED BEATING PAUL

THEN THE TRIBUNE CAME UP AND ARRESTED HIM AND ORDERED HIM TO BE BOUND WITH TWO CHAINS

HE INQUIRED WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE HAD DONE

SOME IN THE CROWD WERE SHOUTING ONE THING SOME ANOTHER

AND AS HE COULD NOT LEARN THE FACTS BECAUSE OF THE UPROAR HE ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE BARRACKS

AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE STEPS HE WAS ACTUALLY CARRIED BY THE SOLDIERS BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE OF THE CROWD FOR THE MOB OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED CRYING OUT AWAY WITH HIM

 AS PAUL WAS ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE BARRACKS HE SAID TO THE TRIBUNE MAY I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU

 AND HE SAID DO YOU KNOW GREEK

ARE YOU NOT THE EGYPTIAN THEN WHO RECENTLY STIRRED UP A REVOLT AND LED THE FOUR THOUSAND MEN OF THE ASSASSINS OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS

 PAUL REPLIED I AM A JEW FROM TARSUS IN CILICIA A CITIZEN OF NO OBSCURE CITY

I BEG YOU PERMIT ME TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE

 AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN HIM PERMISSION PAUL STANDING ON THE STEPS MOTIONED WITH HIS HAND TO THE PEOPLE

AND WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT HUSH HE ADDRESSED THEM IN THE HEBREW LANGUAGE SAYINGBROTHERS AND FATHERS HEAR THE DEFENSE THAT I NOW MAKE BEFORE YOU

 AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING THEM IN THE HEBREW LANGUAGE THEY BECAME EVEN MORE QUIET

AND HE SAID I AM A JEW BORN IN TARSUS IN CILICIA BUT BROUGHT UP IN THIS CITY EDUCATED AT THE FEET OF GAMALIEL ACCORDING TO THE STRICT MANNER OF THE LAW OF OUR FATHERS BEING ZEALOUS FOR GOD AS ALL OF YOU ARE THIS DAY

I PERSECUTED THIS WAY TO THE DEATH BINDING AND DELIVERING TO PRISON BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AS THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE WHOLE COUNCIL OF ELDERS CAN BEAR ME WITNESS

FROM THEM I RECEIVED LETTERS TO THE BROTHERS AND I JOURNEYED TOWARD DAMASCUS TO TAKE THOSE ALSO WHO WERE THERE AND BRING THEM IN BONDS TO JERUSALEM TO BE PUNISHED

AS I WAS ON MY WAY AND DREW NEAR TO DAMASCUS ABOUT NOON A GREAT LIGHT FROM HEAVEN SUDDENLY SHONE AROUND ME

AND I FELL TO THE GROUND AND HEARD A VOICE SAYING TO ME 'SAUL SAUL WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING ME

' AND I ANSWERED 'WHO ARE YOU LORD

' AND HE SAID TO ME 'I AM JESUS OF NAZARETH WHOM YOU ARE PERSECUTING

' NOW THOSE WHO WERE WITH ME SAW THE LIGHT BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE VOICE OF THE ONE WHO WAS SPEAKING TO ME

AND I SAID 'WHAT SHALL I DO LORD

' AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'RISE AND GO INTO DAMASCUS AND THERE YOU WILL BE TOLD ALL THAT IS APPOINTED FOR YOU TO DO

' AND SINCE I COULD NOT SEE BECAUSE OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT LIGHT I WAS LED BY THE HAND BY THOSE WHO WERE WITH ME AND CAME INTO DAMASCUS

AND ONE ANANIAS A DEVOUT MAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW WELL SPOKEN OF BY ALL THE JEWS WHO LIVED THERE CAME TO ME AND STANDING BY ME SAID TO ME 'BROTHER SAUL RECEIVE YOUR SIGHT

' AND AT THAT VERY HOUR I RECEIVED MY SIGHT AND SAW HIM

AND HE SAID 'THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS APPOINTED YOU TO KNOW HIS WILL TO SEE THE RIGHTEOUS ONE AND TO HEAR A VOICE FROM HIS MOUTH; FOR YOU WILL BE A WITNESS FOR HIM TO EVERYONE OF WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD

AND NOW WHY DO YOU WAIT

RISE AND BE BAPTIZED AND WASH AWAY YOUR SINS CALLING ON HIS NAME

' WHEN I HAD RETURNED TO JERUSALEM AND WAS PRAYING IN THE TEMPLE I FELL INTO A TRANCE AND SAW HIM SAYING TO ME 'MAKE HASTE AND GET OUT OF JERUSALEM QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT ME

' AND I SAID 'LORD THEY THEMSELVES KNOW THAT IN ONE SYNAGOGUE AFTER ANOTHER I IMPRISONED AND BEAT THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN YOU

AND WHEN THE BLOOD OF STEPHEN YOUR WITNESS WAS BEING SHED I MYSELF WAS STANDING BY AND APPROVING AND WATCHING OVER THE GARMENTS OF THOSE WHO KILLED HIM

' AND HE SAID TO ME 'GO FOR I WILL SEND YOU FAR AWAY TO THE GENTILES

' UP TO THIS WORD THEY LISTENED TO HIM

THEN THEY RAISED THEIR VOICES AND SAID AWAY WITH SUCH A FELLOW FROM THE EARTH

FOR HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIVE

 AND AS THEY WERE SHOUTING AND THROWING OFF THEIR CLOAKS AND FLINGING DUST INTO THE AIR THE TRIBUNE ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE BARRACKS SAYING THAT HE SHOULD BE EXAMINED BY FLOGGING TO FIND OUT WHY THEY WERE SHOUTING AGAINST HIM LIKE THIS

BUT WHEN THEY HAD STRETCHED HIM OUT FOR THE WHIPS PAUL SAID TO THE CENTURION WHO WAS STANDING BY IS IT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO FLOG A MAN WHO IS A ROMAN CITIZEN AND UNCONDEMNED

 WHEN THE CENTURION HEARD THIS HE WENT TO THE TRIBUNE AND SAID TO HIM WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT TO DO

FOR THIS MAN IS A ROMAN CITIZEN

 SO THE TRIBUNE CAME AND SAID TO HIM TELL ME ARE YOU A ROMAN CITIZEN

 AND HE SAID YES

 THE TRIBUNE ANSWERED I BOUGHT THIS CITIZENSHIP FOR A LARGE SUM

 PAUL SAID BUT I AM A CITIZEN BY BIRTH

 SO THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO EXAMINE HIM WITHDREW FROM HIM IMMEDIATELY AND THE TRIBUNE ALSO WAS AFRAID FOR HE REALIZED THAT PAUL WAS A ROMAN CITIZEN AND THAT HE HAD BOUND HIM

BUT ON THE NEXT DAY DESIRING TO KNOW THE REAL REASON WHY HE WAS BEING ACCUSED BY THE JEWS HE UNBOUND HIM AND COMMANDED THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ALL THE COUNCIL TO MEET AND HE BROUGHT PAUL DOWN AND SET HIM BEFORE THEM

AND LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE COUNCIL PAUL SAID BROTHERS I HAVE LIVED MY LIFE BEFORE GOD IN ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE UP TO THIS DAY

 AND THE HIGH PRIEST ANANIAS COMMANDED THOSE WHO STOOD BY HIM TO STRIKE HIM ON THE MOUTH

THEN PAUL SAID TO HIM GOD IS GOING TO STRIKE YOU YOU WHITEWASHED WALL

ARE YOU SITTING TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND YET CONTRARY TO THE LAW YOU ORDER ME TO BE STRUCK

 THOSE WHO STOOD BY SAID WOULD YOU REVILE GOD'S HIGH PRIEST

 AND PAUL SAID I DID NOT KNOW BROTHERS THAT HE WAS THE HIGH PRIEST FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE

' NOW WHEN PAUL PERCEIVED THAT ONE PART WERE SADDUCEES AND THE OTHER PHARISEES HE CRIED OUT IN THE COUNCIL BROTHERS I AM A PHARISEE A SON OF PHARISEES

IT IS WITH RESPECT TO THE HOPE AND THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD THAT I AM ON TRIAL

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS A DISSENSION AROSE BETWEEN THE PHARISEES AND THE SADDUCEES AND THE ASSEMBLY WAS DIVIDED

FOR THE SADDUCEES SAY THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION NOR ANGEL NOR SPIRIT BUT THE PHARISEES ACKNOWLEDGE THEM ALL

THEN A GREAT CLAMOR AROSE AND SOME OF THE SCRIBES OF THE PHARISEES' PARTY STOOD UP AND CONTENDED SHARPLY WE FIND NOTHING WRONG IN THIS MAN

WHAT IF A SPIRIT OR AN ANGEL SPOKE TO HIM

 AND WHEN THE DISSENSION BECAME VIOLENT THE TRIBUNE AFRAID THAT PAUL WOULD BE TORN TO PIECES BY THEM COMMANDED THE SOLDIERS TO GO DOWN AND TAKE HIM AWAY FROM AMONG THEM BY FORCE AND BRING HIM INTO THE BARRACKS

THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE LORD STOOD BY HIM AND SAID TAKE COURAGE FOR AS YOU HAVE TESTIFIED TO THE FACTS ABOUT ME IN JERUSALEM SO YOU MUST TESTIFY ALSO IN ROME

 WHEN IT WAS DAY THE JEWS MADE A PLOT AND BOUND THEMSELVES BY AN OATH NEITHER TO EAT NOR DRINK TILL THEY HAD KILLED PAUL

THERE WERE MORE THAN FORTY WHO MADE THIS CONSPIRACY

THEY WENT TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS AND SAID WE HAVE STRICTLY BOUND OURSELVES BY AN OATH TO TASTE NO FOOD TILL WE HAVE KILLED PAUL

NOW THEREFORE YOU ALONG WITH THE COUNCIL GIVE NOTICE TO THE TRIBUNE TO BRING HIM DOWN TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO DETERMINE HIS CASE MORE EXACTLY

AND WE ARE READY TO KILL HIM BEFORE HE COMES NEAR

 NOW THE SON OF PAUL'S SISTER HEARD OF THEIR AMBUSH SO HE WENT AND ENTERED THE BARRACKS AND TOLD PAUL

PAUL CALLED ONE OF THE CENTURIONS AND SAID TAKE THIS YOUNG MAN TO THE TRIBUNE FOR HE HAS SOMETHING TO TELL HIM

 SO HE TOOK HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE TRIBUNE AND SAID PAUL THE PRISONER CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO BRING THIS YOUNG MAN TO YOU AS HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU

 THE TRIBUNE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND GOING ASIDE ASKED HIM PRIVATELY WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME

 AND HE SAID THE JEWS HAVE AGREED TO ASK YOU TO BRING PAUL DOWN TO THE COUNCIL TOMORROW AS THOUGH THEY WERE GOING TO INQUIRE SOMEWHAT MORE CLOSELY ABOUT HIM

BUT DO NOT BE PERSUADED BY THEM FOR MORE THAN FORTY OF THEIR MEN ARE LYING IN AMBUSH FOR HIM WHO HAVE BOUND THEMSELVES BY AN OATH NEITHER TO EAT NOR DRINK TILL THEY HAVE KILLED HIM

AND NOW THEY ARE READY WAITING FOR YOUR CONSENT

 SO THE TRIBUNE DISMISSED THE YOUNG MAN CHARGING HIM TELL NO ONE THAT YOU HAVE INFORMED ME OF THESE THINGS

 THEN HE CALLED TWO OF THE CENTURIONS AND SAID GET READY TWO HUNDRED SOLDIERS WITH SEVENTY HORSEMEN AND TWO HUNDRED SPEARMEN TO GO AS FAR AS CAESAREA AT THE THIRD HOUR OF THE NIGHT

ALSO PROVIDE MOUNTS FOR PAUL TO RIDE AND BRING HIM SAFELY TO FELIX THE GOVERNOR

 AND HE WROTE A LETTER TO THIS EFFECT CLAUDIUS LYSIAS TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR FELIX GREETINGS

THIS MAN WAS SEIZED BY THE JEWS AND WAS ABOUT TO BE KILLED BY THEM WHEN I CAME UPON THEM WITH THE SOLDIERS AND RESCUED HIM HAVING LEARNED THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CITIZEN

AND DESIRING TO KNOW THE CHARGE FOR WHICH THEY WERE ACCUSING HIM I BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO THEIR COUNCIL

I FOUND THAT HE WAS BEING ACCUSED ABOUT QUESTIONS OF THEIR LAW BUT CHARGED WITH NOTHING DESERVING DEATH OR IMPRISONMENT

AND WHEN IT WAS DISCLOSED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD BE A PLOT AGAINST THE MAN I SENT HIM TO YOU AT ONCE ORDERING HIS ACCUSERS ALSO TO STATE BEFORE YOU WHAT THEY HAVE AGAINST HIM

 SO THE SOLDIERS ACCORDING TO THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TOOK PAUL AND BROUGHT HIM BY NIGHT TO ANTIPATRIS

AND ON THE NEXT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THE BARRACKS LETTING THE HORSEMEN GO ON WITH HIM

WHEN THEY HAD COME TO CAESAREA AND DELIVERED THE LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR THEY PRESENTED PAUL ALSO BEFORE HIM

ON READING THE LETTER HE ASKED WHAT PROVINCE HE WAS FROM

AND WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE WAS FROM CILICIA HE SAID I WILL GIVE YOU A HEARING WHEN YOUR ACCUSERS ARRIVE

 AND HE COMMANDED HIM TO BE GUARDED IN HEROD'S PRAETORIUM

AND AFTER FIVE DAYS THE HIGH PRIEST ANANIAS CAME DOWN WITH SOME ELDERS AND A SPOKESMAN ONE TERTULLUS

THEY LAID BEFORE THE GOVERNOR THEIR CASE AGAINST PAUL

AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TERTULLUS BEGAN TO ACCUSE HIM SAYINGSINCE THROUGH YOU WE ENJOY MUCH PEACE AND SINCE BY YOUR FORESIGHT MOST EXCELLENT FELIX REFORMS ARE BEING MADE FOR THIS NATION IN EVERY WAY AND EVERYWHERE WE ACCEPT THIS WITH ALL GRATITUDE

BUT TO DETAIN YOU NO FURTHER I BEG YOU IN YOUR KINDNESS TO HEAR US BRIEFLY

FOR WE HAVE FOUND THIS MAN A PLAGUE ONE WHO STIRS UP RIOTS AMONG ALL THE JEWS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IS A RINGLEADER OF THE SECT OF THE NAZARENES

HE EVEN TRIED TO PROFANE THE TEMPLE BUT WE SEIZED HIM

SEE FOOTNOTE BY EXAMINING HIM YOURSELF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT FROM HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING OF WHICH WE ACCUSE HIM

 THE JEWS ALSO JOINED IN THE CHARGE AFFIRMING THAT ALL THESE THINGS WERE SO

AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD NODDED TO HIM TO SPEAK PAUL REPLIEDKNOWING THAT FOR MANY YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN A JUDGE OVER THIS NATION I CHEERFULLY MAKE MY DEFENSE

YOU CAN VERIFY THAT IT IS NOT MORE THAN TWELVE DAYS SINCE I WENT UP TO WORSHIP IN JERUSALEM AND THEY DID NOT FIND ME DISPUTING WITH ANYONE OR STIRRING UP A CROWD EITHER IN THE TEMPLE OR IN THE SYNAGOGUES OR IN THE CITY

NEITHER CAN THEY PROVE TO YOU WHAT THEY NOW BRING UP AGAINST ME

BUT THIS I CONFESS TO YOU THAT ACCORDING TO THE WAY WHICH THEY CALL A SECT I WORSHIP THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS BELIEVING EVERYTHING LAID DOWN BY THE LAW AND WRITTEN IN THE PROPHETS HAVING A HOPE IN GOD WHICH THESE MEN THEMSELVES ACCEPT THAT THERE WILL BE A RESURRECTION OF BOTH THE JUST AND THE UNJUST

SO I ALWAYS TAKE PAINS TO HAVE A CLEAR CONSCIENCE TOWARD BOTH GOD AND MAN

NOW AFTER SEVERAL YEARS I CAME TO BRING ALMS TO MY NATION AND TO PRESENT OFFERINGS

WHILE I WAS DOING THIS THEY FOUND ME PURIFIED IN THE TEMPLE WITHOUT ANY CROWD OR TUMULT

BUT SOME JEWS FROM ASIA THEY OUGHT TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU AND TO MAKE AN ACCUSATION SHOULD THEY HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST ME

OR ELSE LET THESE MEN THEMSELVES SAY WHAT WRONGDOING THEY FOUND WHEN I STOOD BEFORE THE COUNCIL OTHER THAN THIS ONE THING THAT I CRIED OUT WHILE STANDING AMONG THEM 'IT IS WITH RESPECT TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD THAT I AM ON TRIAL BEFORE YOU THIS DAY

' BUT FELIX HAVING A RATHER ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAY PUT THEM OFF SAYING WHEN LYSIAS THE TRIBUNE COMES DOWN I WILL DECIDE YOUR CASE

 THEN HE GAVE ORDERS TO THE CENTURION THAT HE SHOULD BE KEPT IN CUSTODY BUT HAVE SOME LIBERTY AND THAT NONE OF HIS FRIENDS SHOULD BE PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING TO HIS NEEDS

AFTER SOME DAYS FELIX CAME WITH HIS WIFE DRUSILLA WHO WAS JEWISH AND HE SENT FOR PAUL AND HEARD HIM SPEAK ABOUT FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS

AND AS HE REASONED ABOUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SELFCONTROL AND THE COMING JUDGMENT FELIX WAS ALARMED AND SAID GO AWAY FOR THE PRESENT

WHEN I GET AN OPPORTUNITY I WILL SUMMON YOU

 AT THE SAME TIME HE HOPED THAT MONEY WOULD BE GIVEN HIM BY PAUL

SO HE SENT FOR HIM OFTEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM

WHEN TWO YEARS HAD ELAPSED FELIX WAS SUCCEEDED BY PORCIUS FESTUS

AND DESIRING TO DO THE JEWS A FAVOR FELIX LEFT PAUL IN PRISON

NOW THREE DAYS AFTER FESTUS HAD ARRIVED IN THE PROVINCE HE WENT UP TO JERUSALEM FROM CAESAREA

AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE JEWS LAID OUT THEIR CASE AGAINST PAUL AND THEY URGED HIM ASKING AS A FAVOR AGAINST PAUL THAT HE SUMMON HIM TO JERUSALEMBECAUSE THEY WERE PLANNING AN AMBUSH TO KILL HIM ON THE WAY

FESTUS REPLIED THAT PAUL WAS BEING KEPT AT CAESAREA AND THAT HE HIMSELF INTENDED TO GO THERE SHORTLY

SO SAID HE LET THE MEN OF AUTHORITY AMONG YOU GO DOWN WITH ME AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG ABOUT THE MAN LET THEM BRING CHARGES AGAINST HIM

 AFTER HE STAYED AMONG THEM NOT MORE THAN EIGHT OR TEN DAYS HE WENT DOWN TO CAESAREA

AND THE NEXT DAY HE TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE TRIBUNAL AND ORDERED PAUL TO BE BROUGHT

WHEN HE HAD ARRIVED THE JEWS WHO HAD COME DOWN FROM JERUSALEM STOOD AROUND HIM BRINGING MANY AND SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST HIM THAT THEY COULD NOT PROVE

PAUL ARGUED IN HIS DEFENSE NEITHER AGAINST THE LAW OF THE JEWS NOR AGAINST THE TEMPLE NOR AGAINST CAESAR HAVE I COMMITTED ANY OFFENSE

 BUT FESTUS WISHING TO DO THE JEWS A FAVOR SAID TO PAUL DO YOU WISH TO GO UP TO JERUSALEM AND THERE BE TRIED ON THESE CHARGES BEFORE ME

 BUT PAUL SAID I AM STANDING BEFORE CAESAR'S TRIBUNAL WHERE I OUGHT TO BE TRIED

TO THE JEWS I HAVE DONE NO WRONG AS YOU YOURSELVES KNOW VERY WELL

IF THEN I AM A WRONGDOER AND HAVE COMMITTED ANYTHING FOR WHICH I DESERVE TO DIE I DO NOT SEEK TO ESCAPE DEATH

BUT IF THERE IS NOTHING TO THEIR CHARGES AGAINST ME NO ONE CAN GIVE ME UP TO THEM

I APPEAL TO CAESAR

 THEN FESTUS WHEN HE HAD CONFERRED WITH HIS COUNCIL ANSWERED TO CAESAR YOU HAVE APPEALED; TO CAESAR YOU SHALL GO

 NOW WHEN SOME DAYS HAD PASSED AGRIPPA THE KING AND BERNICE ARRIVED AT CAESAREA AND GREETED FESTUS

AND AS THEY STAYED THERE MANY DAYS FESTUS LAID PAUL'S CASE BEFORE THE KING SAYING THERE IS A MAN LEFT PRISONER BY FELIX AND WHEN I WAS AT JERUSALEM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE JEWS LAID OUT THEIR CASE AGAINST HIM ASKING FOR A SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION AGAINST HIM

I ANSWERED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE CUSTOM OF THE ROMANS TO GIVE UP ANYONE BEFORE THE ACCUSED MET THE ACCUSERS FACE TO FACE AND HAD OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HIS DEFENSE CONCERNING THE CHARGE LAID AGAINST HIM

SO WHEN THEY CAME TOGETHER HERE I MADE NO DELAY BUT ON THE NEXT DAY TOOK MY SEAT ON THE TRIBUNAL AND ORDERED THE MAN TO BE BROUGHT

WHEN THE ACCUSERS STOOD UP THEY BROUGHT NO CHARGE IN HIS CASE OF SUCH EVILS AS I SUPPOSED

RATHER THEY HAD CERTAIN POINTS OF DISPUTE WITH HIM ABOUT THEIR OWN RELIGION AND ABOUT A CERTAIN JESUS WHO WAS DEAD BUT WHOM PAUL ASSERTED TO BE ALIVE

BEING AT A LOSS HOW TO INVESTIGATE THESE QUESTIONS I ASKED WHETHER HE WANTED TO GO TO JERUSALEM AND BE TRIED THERE REGARDING THEM

BUT WHEN PAUL HAD APPEALED TO BE KEPT IN CUSTODY FOR THE DECISION OF THE EMPEROR I ORDERED HIM TO BE HELD UNTIL I COULD SEND HIM TO CAESAR

 THEN AGRIPPA SAID TO FESTUS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE MAN MYSELF

TOMORROW SAID HE YOU WILL HEAR HIM

 SO ON THE NEXT DAY AGRIPPA AND BERNICE CAME WITH GREAT POMP AND THEY ENTERED THE AUDIENCE HALL WITH THE MILITARY TRIBUNES AND THE PROMINENT MEN OF THE CITY

THEN AT THE COMMAND OF FESTUS PAUL WAS BROUGHT IN

AND FESTUS SAID KING AGRIPPA AND ALL WHO ARE PRESENT WITH US YOU SEE THIS MAN ABOUT WHOM THE WHOLE JEWISH PEOPLE PETITIONED ME BOTH IN JERUSALEM AND HERE SHOUTING THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO LIVE ANY LONGER

BUT I FOUND THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING DESERVING DEATH

AND AS HE HIMSELF APPEALED TO THE EMPEROR I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND SEND HIM

BUT I HAVE NOTHING DEFINITE TO WRITE TO MY LORD ABOUT HIM

THEREFORE I HAVE BROUGHT HIM BEFORE YOU ALL AND ESPECIALLY BEFORE YOU KING AGRIPPA SO THAT AFTER WE HAVE EXAMINED HIM I MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO WRITE

FOR IT SEEMS TO ME UNREASONABLE IN SENDING A PRISONER NOT TO INDICATE THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM

SO AGRIPPA SAID TO PAUL YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO SPEAK FOR YOURSELF

 THEN PAUL STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND MADE HIS DEFENSE I CONSIDER MYSELF FORTUNATE THAT IT IS BEFORE YOU KING AGRIPPA I AM GOING TO MAKE MY DEFENSE TODAY AGAINST ALL THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE JEWS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE CUSTOMS AND CONTROVERSIES OF THE JEWS

THEREFORE I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO ME PATIENTLY

MY MANNER OF LIFE FROM MY YOUTH SPENT FROM THE BEGINNING AMONG MY OWN NATION AND IN JERUSALEM IS KNOWN BY ALL THE JEWS

THEY HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME IF THEY ARE WILLING TO TESTIFY THAT ACCORDING TO THE STRICTEST PARTY OF OUR RELIGION I HAVE LIVED AS A PHARISEE

AND NOW I STAND HERE ON TRIAL BECAUSE OF MY HOPE IN THE PROMISE MADE BY GOD TO OUR FATHERS TO WHICH OUR TWELVE TRIBES HOPE TO ATTAIN AS THEY EARNESTLY WORSHIP NIGHT AND DAY

AND FOR THIS HOPE I AM ACCUSED BY JEWS O KING

WHY IS IT THOUGHT INCREDIBLE BY ANY OF YOU THAT GOD RAISES THE DEAD

I MYSELF WAS CONVINCED THAT I OUGHT TO DO MANY THINGS IN OPPOSING THE NAME OF JESUS OF NAZARETH

AND I DID SO IN JERUSALEM

I NOT ONLY LOCKED UP MANY OF THE SAINTS IN PRISON AFTER RECEIVING AUTHORITY FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS BUT WHEN THEY WERE PUT TO DEATH I CAST MY VOTE AGAINST THEM

AND I PUNISHED THEM OFTEN IN ALL THE SYNAGOGUES AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM BLASPHEME AND IN RAGING FURY AGAINST THEM I PERSECUTED THEM EVEN TO FOREIGN CITIES

IN THIS CONNECTION I JOURNEYED TO DAMASCUS WITH THE AUTHORITY AND COMMISSION OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS

AT MIDDAY O KING I SAW ON THE WAY A LIGHT FROM HEAVEN BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN THAT SHONE AROUND ME AND THOSE WHO JOURNEYED WITH ME

AND WHEN WE HAD ALL FALLEN TO THE GROUND I HEARD A VOICE SAYING TO ME IN THE HEBREW LANGUAGE 'SAUL SAUL WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING ME

IT IS HARD FOR YOU TO KICK AGAINST THE GOADS

' AND I SAID 'WHO ARE YOU LORD

' AND THE LORD SAID 'I AM JESUS WHOM YOU ARE PERSECUTING

BUT RISE AND STAND UPON YOUR FEET FOR I HAVE APPEARED TO YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE TO APPOINT YOU AS A SERVANT AND WITNESS TO THE THINGS IN WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN ME AND TO THOSE IN WHICH I WILL APPEAR TO YOU DELIVERING YOU FROM YOUR PEOPLE AND FROM THE GENTILESTO WHOM I AM SENDING YOU TO OPEN THEIR EYES SO THAT THEY MAY TURN FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT AND FROM THE POWER OF SATAN TO GOD THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND A PLACE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE SANCTIFIED BY FAITH IN ME

' THEREFORE O KING AGRIPPA I WAS NOT DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION BUT DECLARED FIRST TO THOSE IN DAMASCUS THEN IN JERUSALEM AND THROUGHOUT ALL THE REGION OF JUDEA AND ALSO TO THE GENTILES THAT THEY SHOULD REPENT AND TURN TO GOD PERFORMING DEEDS IN KEEPING WITH THEIR REPENTANCE

FOR THIS REASON THE JEWS SEIZED ME IN THE TEMPLE AND TRIED TO KILL ME

TO THIS DAY I HAVE HAD THE HELP THAT COMES FROM GOD AND SO I STAND HERE TESTIFYING BOTH TO SMALL AND GREAT SAYING NOTHING BUT WHAT THE PROPHETS AND MOSES SAID WOULD COME TO PASS THAT THE CHRIST MUST SUFFER AND THAT BY BEING THE FIRST TO RISE FROM THE DEAD HE WOULD PROCLAIM LIGHT BOTH TO OUR PEOPLE AND TO THE GENTILES

 AND AS HE WAS SAYING THESE THINGS IN HIS DEFENSE FESTUS SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE PAUL YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND; YOUR GREAT LEARNING IS DRIVING YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND

 BUT PAUL SAID I AM NOT OUT OF MY MIND MOST EXCELLENT FESTUS BUT I AM SPEAKING TRUE AND RATIONAL WORDS

FOR THE KING KNOWS ABOUT THESE THINGS AND TO HIM I SPEAK BOLDLY

FOR I AM PERSUADED THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS HAS ESCAPED HIS NOTICE FOR THIS HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN A CORNER

KING AGRIPPA DO YOU BELIEVE THE PROPHETS

I KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE

 AND AGRIPPA SAID TO PAUL IN A SHORT TIME WOULD YOU PERSUADE ME TO BE A CHRISTIAN

 AND PAUL SAID WHETHER SHORT OR LONG I WOULD TO GOD THAT NOT ONLY YOU BUT ALSO ALL WHO HEAR ME THIS DAY MIGHT BECOME SUCH AS I AMEXCEPT FOR THESE CHAINS

 THEN THE KING ROSE AND THE GOVERNOR AND BERNICE AND THOSE WHO WERE SITTING WITH THEM

AND WHEN THEY HAD WITHDRAWN THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THIS MAN IS DOING NOTHING TO DESERVE DEATH OR IMPRISONMENT

 AND AGRIPPA SAID TO FESTUS THIS MAN COULD HAVE BEEN SET FREE IF HE HAD NOT APPEALED TO CAESAR

AND WHEN IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE SHOULD SAIL FOR ITALY THEY DELIVERED PAUL AND SOME OTHER PRISONERS TO A CENTURION OF THE AUGUSTAN COHORT NAMED JULIUS

AND EMBARKING IN A SHIP OF ADRAMYTTIUM WHICH WAS ABOUT TO SAIL TO THE PORTS ALONG THE COAST OF ASIA WE PUT TO SEA ACCOMPANIED BY ARISTARCHUS A MACEDONIAN FROM THESSALONICA

THE NEXT DAY WE PUT IN AT SIDON

AND JULIUS TREATED PAUL KINDLY AND GAVE HIM LEAVE TO GO TO HIS FRIENDS AND BE CARED FOR

AND PUTTING OUT TO SEA FROM THERE WE SAILED UNDER THE LEE OF CYPRUS BECAUSE THE WINDS WERE AGAINST US

AND WHEN WE HAD SAILED ACROSS THE OPEN SEA ALONG THE COAST OF CILICIA AND PAMPHYLIA WE CAME TO MYRA IN LYCIA

THERE THE CENTURION FOUND A SHIP OF ALEXANDRIA SAILING FOR ITALY AND PUT US ON BOARD

WE SAILED SLOWLY FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS AND ARRIVED WITH DIFFICULTY OFF CNIDUS AND AS THE WIND DID NOT ALLOW US TO GO FARTHER WE SAILED UNDER THE LEE OF CRETE OFF SALMONE

COASTING ALONG IT WITH DIFFICULTY WE CAME TO A PLACE CALLED FAIR HAVENS NEAR WHICH WAS THE CITY OF LASEA

SINCE MUCH TIME HAD PASSED AND THE VOYAGE WAS NOW DANGEROUS BECAUSE EVEN THE FAST WAS ALREADY OVER PAUL ADVISED THEM SAYING SIRS I PERCEIVE THAT THE VOYAGE WILL BE WITH INJURY AND MUCH LOSS NOT ONLY OF THE CARGO AND THE SHIP BUT ALSO OF OUR LIVES

 BUT THE CENTURION PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE PILOT AND TO THE OWNER OF THE SHIP THAN TO WHAT PAUL SAID

AND BECAUSE THE HARBOR WAS NOT SUITABLE TO SPEND THE WINTER IN THE MAJORITY DECIDED TO PUT OUT TO SEA FROM THERE ON THE CHANCE THAT SOMEHOW THEY COULD REACH PHOENIX A HARBOR OF CRETE FACING BOTH SOUTHWEST AND NORTHWEST AND SPEND THE WINTER THERE

NOW WHEN THE SOUTH WIND BLEW GENTLY SUPPOSING THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED THEIR PURPOSE THEY WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SAILED ALONG CRETE CLOSE TO THE SHORE

BUT SOON A TEMPESTUOUS WIND CALLED THE NORTHEASTER STRUCK DOWN FROM THE LAND

AND WHEN THE SHIP WAS CAUGHT AND COULD NOT FACE THE WIND WE GAVE WAY TO IT AND WERE DRIVEN ALONG

RUNNING UNDER THE LEE OF A SMALL ISLAND CALLED CAUDA WE MANAGED WITH DIFFICULTY TO SECURE THE SHIP'S BOAT

AFTER HOISTING IT UP THEY USED SUPPORTS TO UNDERGIRD THE SHIP

THEN FEARING THAT THEY WOULD RUN AGROUND ON THE SYRTIS THEY LOWERED THE GEAR AND THUS THEY WERE DRIVEN ALONG

SINCE WE WERE VIOLENTLY STORMTOSSED THEY BEGAN THE NEXT DAY TO JETTISON THE CARGO

AND ON THE THIRD DAY THEY THREW THE SHIP'S TACKLE OVERBOARD WITH THEIR OWN HANDS

WHEN NEITHER SUN NOR STARS APPEARED FOR MANY DAYS AND NO SMALL TEMPEST LAY ON US ALL HOPE OF OUR BEING SAVED WAS AT LAST ABANDONED

SINCE THEY HAD BEEN WITHOUT FOOD FOR A LONG TIME PAUL STOOD UP AMONG THEM AND SAID MEN YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME AND NOT HAVE SET SAIL FROM CRETE AND INCURRED THIS INJURY AND LOSS

YET NOW I URGE YOU TO TAKE HEART FOR THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF LIFE AMONG YOU BUT ONLY OF THE SHIP

FOR THIS VERY NIGHT THERE STOOD BEFORE ME AN ANGEL OF THE GOD TO WHOM I BELONG AND WHOM I WORSHIP AND HE SAID 'DO NOT BE AFRAID PAUL; YOU MUST STAND BEFORE CAESAR

AND BEHOLD GOD HAS GRANTED YOU ALL THOSE WHO SAIL WITH YOU

' SO TAKE HEART MEN FOR I HAVE FAITH IN GOD THAT IT WILL BE EXACTLY AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD

BUT WE MUST RUN AGROUND ON SOME ISLAND

 WHEN THE FOURTEENTH NIGHT HAD COME AS WE WERE BEING DRIVEN ACROSS THE ADRIATIC SEA ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE SAILORS SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE NEARING LAND

SO THEY TOOK A SOUNDING AND FOUND TWENTY FATHOMS

A LITTLE FARTHER ON THEY TOOK A SOUNDING AGAIN AND FOUND FIFTEEN FATHOMS

AND FEARING THAT WE MIGHT RUN ON THE ROCKS THEY LET DOWN FOUR ANCHORS FROM THE STERN AND PRAYED FOR DAY TO COME

AND AS THE SAILORS WERE SEEKING TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP AND HAD LOWERED THE SHIP'S BOAT INTO THE SEA UNDER PRETENSE OF LAYING OUT ANCHORS FROM THE BOW PAUL SAID TO THE CENTURION AND THE SOLDIERS UNLESS THESE MEN STAY IN THE SHIP YOU CANNOT BE SAVED

 THEN THE SOLDIERS CUT AWAY THE ROPES OF THE SHIP'S BOAT AND LET IT GO

AS DAY WAS ABOUT TO DAWN PAUL URGED THEM ALL TO TAKE SOME FOOD SAYING TODAY IS THE FOURTEENTH DAY THAT YOU HAVE CONTINUED IN SUSPENSE AND WITHOUT FOOD HAVING TAKEN NOTHING

THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO TAKE SOME FOOD

IT WILL GIVE YOU STRENGTH FOR NOT A HAIR IS TO PERISH FROM THE HEAD OF ANY OF YOU

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE TOOK BREAD AND GIVING THANKS TO GOD IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HE BROKE IT AND BEGAN TO EAT

THEN THEY ALL WERE ENCOURAGED AND ATE SOME FOOD THEMSELVES

WE WERE IN ALL  PERSONS IN THE SHIP

 AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN ENOUGH THEY LIGHTENED THE SHIP THROWING OUT THE WHEAT INTO THE SEA

NOW WHEN IT WAS DAY THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE LAND BUT THEY NOTICED A BAY WITH A BEACH ON WHICH THEY PLANNED IF POSSIBLE TO RUN THE SHIP ASHORE

SO THEY CAST OFF THE ANCHORS AND LEFT THEM IN THE SEA AT THE SAME TIME LOOSENING THE ROPES THAT TIED THE RUDDERS

THEN HOISTING THE FORESAIL TO THE WIND THEY MADE FOR THE BEACH

BUT STRIKING A REEF THEY RAN THE VESSEL AGROUND

THE BOW STUCK AND REMAINED IMMOVABLE AND THE STERN WAS BEING BROKEN UP BY THE SURF

THE SOLDIERS' PLAN WAS TO KILL THE PRISONERS LEST ANY SHOULD SWIM AWAY AND ESCAPE

BUT THE CENTURION WISHING TO SAVE PAUL KEPT THEM FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR PLAN

HE ORDERED THOSE WHO COULD SWIM TO JUMP OVERBOARD FIRST AND MAKE FOR THE LAND AND THE REST ON PLANKS OR ON PIECES OF THE SHIP

AND SO IT WAS THAT ALL WERE BROUGHT SAFELY TO LAND

AFTER WE WERE BROUGHT SAFELY THROUGH WE THEN LEARNED THAT THE ISLAND WAS CALLED MALTA

THE NATIVE PEOPLE SHOWED US UNUSUAL KINDNESS FOR THEY KINDLED A FIRE AND WELCOMED US ALL BECAUSE IT HAD BEGUN TO RAIN AND WAS COLD

WHEN PAUL HAD GATHERED A BUNDLE OF STICKS AND PUT THEM ON THE FIRE A VIPER CAME OUT BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND FASTENED ON HIS HAND

WHEN THE NATIVE PEOPLE SAW THE CREATURE HANGING FROM HIS HAND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER NO DOUBT THIS MAN IS A MURDERER

THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED FROM THE SEA JUSTICE HAS NOT ALLOWED HIM TO LIVE

 HE HOWEVER SHOOK OFF THE CREATURE INTO THE FIRE AND SUFFERED NO HARM

THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIM TO SWELL UP OR SUDDENLY FALL DOWN DEAD

BUT WHEN THEY HAD WAITED A LONG TIME AND SAW NO MISFORTUNE COME TO HIM THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND SAID THAT HE WAS A GOD

NOW IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT PLACE WERE LANDS BELONGING TO THE CHIEF MAN OF THE ISLAND NAMED PUBLIUS WHO RECEIVED US AND ENTERTAINED US HOSPITABLY FOR THREE DAYS

IT HAPPENED THAT THE FATHER OF PUBLIUS LAY SICK WITH FEVER AND DYSENTERY

AND PAUL VISITED HIM AND PRAYED AND PUTTING HIS HANDS ON HIM HEALED HIM

AND WHEN THIS HAD TAKEN PLACE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND WHO HAD DISEASES ALSO CAME AND WERE CURED

THEY ALSO HONORED US GREATLY AND WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TO SAIL THEY PUT ON BOARD WHATEVER WE NEEDED

AFTER THREE MONTHS WE SET SAIL IN A SHIP THAT HAD WINTERED IN THE ISLAND A SHIP OF ALEXANDRIA WITH THE TWIN GODS AS A FIGUREHEAD

PUTTING IN AT SYRACUSE WE STAYED THERE FOR THREE DAYS

AND FROM THERE WE MADE A CIRCUIT AND ARRIVED AT RHEGIUM

AND AFTER ONE DAY A SOUTH WIND SPRANG UP AND ON THE SECOND DAY WE CAME TO PUTEOLI

THERE WE FOUND BROTHERS AND WERE INVITED TO STAY WITH THEM FOR SEVEN DAYS

AND SO WE CAME TO ROME

AND THE BROTHERS THERE WHEN THEY HEARD ABOUT US CAME AS FAR AS THE FORUM OF APPIUS AND THREE TAVERNS TO MEET US

ON SEEING THEM PAUL THANKED GOD AND TOOK COURAGE

AND WHEN WE CAME INTO ROME PAUL WAS ALLOWED TO STAY BY HIMSELF WITH THE SOLDIER THAT GUARDED HIM

AFTER THREE DAYS HE CALLED TOGETHER THE LOCAL LEADERS OF THE JEWS AND WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED HE SAID TO THEM BROTHERS THOUGH I HAD DONE NOTHING AGAINST OUR PEOPLE OR THE CUSTOMS OF OUR FATHERS YET I WAS DELIVERED AS A PRISONER FROM JERUSALEM INTO THE HANDS OF THE ROMANS

WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED ME THEY WISHED TO SET ME AT LIBERTY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IN MY CASE

BUT BECAUSE THE JEWS OBJECTED I WAS COMPELLED TO APPEAL TO CAESARTHOUGH I HAD NO CHARGE TO BRING AGAINST MY NATION

FOR THIS REASON THEREFORE I HAVE ASKED TO SEE YOU AND SPEAK WITH YOU SINCE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE HOPE OF ISRAEL THAT I AM WEARING THIS CHAIN

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM WE HAVE RECEIVED NO LETTERS FROM JUDEA ABOUT YOU AND NONE OF THE BROTHERS COMING HERE HAS REPORTED OR SPOKEN ANY EVIL ABOUT YOU

BUT WE DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOUR VIEWS ARE FOR WITH REGARD TO THIS SECT WE KNOW THAT EVERYWHERE IT IS SPOKEN AGAINST

 WHEN THEY HAD APPOINTED A DAY FOR HIM THEY CAME TO HIM AT HIS LODGING IN GREATER NUMBERS

FROM MORNING TILL EVENING HE EXPOUNDED TO THEM TESTIFYING TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT JESUS BOTH FROM THE LAW OF MOSES AND FROM THE PROPHETS

AND SOME WERE CONVINCED BY WHAT HE SAID BUT OTHERS DISBELIEVED

AND DISAGREEING AMONG THEMSELVES THEY DEPARTED AFTER PAUL HAD MADE ONE STATEMENT THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS RIGHT IN SAYING TO YOUR FATHERS THROUGH ISAIAH THE PROPHET 'GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY YOU WILL INDEED HEAR BUT NEVER UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL INDEED SEE BUT NEVER PERCEIVE

FOR THIS PEOPLE'S HEART HAS GROWN DULL AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY CAN BARELY HEAR AND THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED; LEST THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND TURN AND I WOULD HEAL THEM

' THEREFORE LET IT BE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THIS SALVATION OF GOD HAS BEEN SENT TO THE GENTILES; THEY WILL LISTEN

 SEE FOOTNOTE HE LIVED THERE TWO WHOLE YEARS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE AND WELCOMED ALL WHO CAME TO HIM PROCLAIMING THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND TEACHING ABOUT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL BOLDNESS AND WITHOUT HINDRANCE

JOBTHERE WAS A MAN IN THE LAND OF UZ WHOSE NAME WAS JOB AND THAT MAN WAS BLAMELESS AND UPRIGHT ONE WHO FEARED GOD AND TURNED AWAY FROM EVIL

THERE WERE BORN TO HIM SEVEN SONS AND THREE DAUGHTERS

HE POSSESSED  SHEEP  CAMELS  YOKE OF OXEN AND  FEMALE DONKEYS AND VERY MANY SERVANTS SO THAT THIS MAN WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST

HIS SONS USED TO GO AND HOLD A FEAST IN THE HOUSE OF EACH ONE ON HIS DAY AND THEY WOULD SEND AND INVITE THEIR THREE SISTERS TO EAT AND DRINK WITH THEM

AND WHEN THE DAYS OF THE FEAST HAD RUN THEIR COURSE JOB WOULD SEND AND CONSECRATE THEM AND HE WOULD RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THEM ALL

FOR JOB SAID IT MAY BE THAT MY CHILDREN HAVE SINNED AND CURSED GOD IN THEIR HEARTS

 THUS JOB DID CONTINUALLY

NOW THERE WAS A DAY WHEN THE SONS OF GOD CAME TO PRESENT THEMSELVES BEFORE THE LORD AND SATAN ALSO CAME AMONG THEM

THE LORD SAID TO SATAN FROM WHERE HAVE YOU COME

 SATAN ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID FROM GOING TO AND FRO ON THE EARTH AND FROM WALKING UP AND DOWN ON IT

 AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM ON THE EARTH A BLAMELESS AND UPRIGHT MAN WHO FEARS GOD AND TURNS AWAY FROM EVIL

 THEN SATAN ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID DOES JOB FEAR GOD FOR NO REASON

HAVE YOU NOT PUT A HEDGE AROUND HIM AND HIS HOUSE AND ALL THAT HE HAS ON EVERY SIDE

YOU HAVE BLESSED THE WORK OF HIS HANDS AND HIS POSSESSIONS HAVE INCREASED IN THE LAND

BUT STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND AND TOUCH ALL THAT HE HAS AND HE WILL CURSE YOU TO YOUR FACE

 AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN BEHOLD ALL THAT HE HAS IS IN YOUR HAND

ONLY AGAINST HIM DO NOT STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND

 SO SATAN WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD

NOW THERE WAS A DAY WHEN HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS WERE EATING AND DRINKING WINE IN THEIR OLDEST BROTHER'S HOUSE AND THERE CAME A MESSENGER TO JOB AND SAID THE OXEN WERE PLOWING AND THE DONKEYS FEEDING BESIDE THEM AND THE SABEANS FELL UPON THEM AND TOOK THEM AND STRUCK DOWN THE SERVANTS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND I ALONE HAVE ESCAPED TO TELL YOU

 WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING THERE CAME ANOTHER AND SAID THE FIRE OF GOD FELL FROM HEAVEN AND BURNED UP THE SHEEP AND THE SERVANTS AND CONSUMED THEM AND I ALONE HAVE ESCAPED TO TELL YOU

 WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING THERE CAME ANOTHER AND SAID THE CHALDEANS FORMED THREE GROUPS AND MADE A RAID ON THE CAMELS AND TOOK THEM AND STRUCK DOWN THE SERVANTS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND I ALONE HAVE ESCAPED TO TELL YOU

 WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING THERE CAME ANOTHER AND SAID YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WERE EATING AND DRINKING WINE IN THEIR OLDEST BROTHER'S HOUSE AND BEHOLD A GREAT WIND CAME ACROSS THE WILDERNESS AND STRUCK THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE HOUSE AND IT FELL UPON THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE DEAD AND I ALONE HAVE ESCAPED TO TELL YOU

 THEN JOB AROSE AND TORE HIS ROBE AND SHAVED HIS HEAD AND FELL ON THE GROUND AND WORSHIPED

AND HE SAID NAKED I CAME FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB AND NAKED SHALL I RETURN

THE LORD GAVE AND THE LORD HAS TAKEN AWAY; BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD

 IN ALL THIS JOB DID NOT SIN OR CHARGE GOD WITH WRONG

AGAIN THERE WAS A DAY WHEN THE SONS OF GOD CAME TO PRESENT THEMSELVES BEFORE THE LORD AND SATAN ALSO CAME AMONG THEM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN FROM WHERE HAVE YOU COME

 SATAN ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID FROM GOING TO AND FRO ON THE EARTH AND FROM WALKING UP AND DOWN ON IT

 AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM ON THE EARTH A BLAMELESS AND UPRIGHT MAN WHO FEARS GOD AND TURNS AWAY FROM EVIL

HE STILL HOLDS FAST HIS INTEGRITY ALTHOUGH YOU INCITED ME AGAINST HIM TO DESTROY HIM WITHOUT REASON

 THEN SATAN ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID SKIN FOR SKIN

ALL THAT A MAN HAS HE WILL GIVE FOR HIS LIFE

BUT STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND AND TOUCH HIS BONE AND HIS FLESH AND HE WILL CURSE YOU TO YOUR FACE

 AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN BEHOLD HE IS IN YOUR HAND; ONLY SPARE HIS LIFE

 SO SATAN WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND STRUCK JOB WITH LOATHSOME SORES FROM THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD

AND HE TOOK A PIECE OF BROKEN POTTERY WITH WHICH TO SCRAPE HIMSELF WHILE HE SAT IN THE ASHES

THEN HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM DO YOU STILL HOLD FAST YOUR INTEGRITY

CURSE GOD AND DIE

 BUT HE SAID TO HER YOU SPEAK AS ONE OF THE FOOLISH WOMEN WOULD SPEAK

SHALL WE RECEIVE GOOD FROM GOD AND SHALL WE NOT RECEIVE EVIL

 IN ALL THIS JOB DID NOT SIN WITH HIS LIPS

NOW WHEN JOB'S THREE FRIENDS HEARD OF ALL THIS EVIL THAT HAD COME UPON HIM THEY CAME EACH FROM HIS OWN PLACE ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE BILDAD THE SHUHITE AND ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE

THEY MADE AN APPOINTMENT TOGETHER TO COME TO SHOW HIM SYMPATHY AND COMFORT HIM

AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM FROM A DISTANCE THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM

AND THEY RAISED THEIR VOICES AND WEPT AND THEY TORE THEIR ROBES AND SPRINKLED DUST ON THEIR HEADS TOWARD HEAVEN

AND THEY SAT WITH HIM ON THE GROUND SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS AND NO ONE SPOKE A WORD TO HIM FOR THEY SAW THAT HIS SUFFERING WAS VERY GREAT

AFTER THIS JOB OPENED HIS MOUTH AND CURSED THE DAY OF HIS BIRTH

AND JOB SAID LET THE DAY PERISH ON WHICH I WAS BORN AND THE NIGHT THAT SAID 'A MAN IS CONCEIVED

' LET THAT DAY BE DARKNESS

MAY GOD ABOVE NOT SEEK IT NOR LIGHT SHINE UPON IT

LET GLOOM AND DEEP DARKNESS CLAIM IT

LET CLOUDS DWELL UPON IT; LET THE BLACKNESS OF THE DAY TERRIFY IT

THAT NIGHTLET THICK DARKNESS SEIZE IT

LET IT NOT REJOICE AMONG THE DAYS OF THE YEAR; LET IT NOT COME INTO THE NUMBER OF THE MONTHS

BEHOLD LET THAT NIGHT BE BARREN; LET NO JOYFUL CRY ENTER IT

LET THOSE CURSE IT WHO CURSE THE DAY WHO ARE READY TO ROUSE UP LEVIATHAN

LET THE STARS OF ITS DAWN BE DARK; LET IT HOPE FOR LIGHT BUT HAVE NONE NOR SEE THE EYELIDS OF THE MORNING BECAUSE IT DID NOT SHUT THE DOORS OF MY MOTHER'S WOMB NOR HIDE TROUBLE FROM MY EYES

WHY DID I NOT DIE AT BIRTH COME OUT FROM THE WOMB AND EXPIRE

WHY DID THE KNEES RECEIVE ME

OR WHY THE BREASTS THAT I SHOULD NURSE

FOR THEN I WOULD HAVE LAIN DOWN AND BEEN QUIET; I WOULD HAVE SLEPT; THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN AT REST WITH KINGS AND COUNSELORS OF THE EARTH WHO REBUILT RUINS FOR THEMSELVES OR WITH PRINCES WHO HAD GOLD WHO FILLED THEIR HOUSES WITH SILVER

OR WHY WAS I NOT AS A HIDDEN STILLBORN CHILD AS INFANTS WHO NEVER SEE THE LIGHT

THERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING AND THERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST

THERE THE PRISONERS ARE AT EASE TOGETHER; THEY HEAR NOT THE VOICE OF THE TASKMASTER

THE SMALL AND THE GREAT ARE THERE AND THE SLAVE IS FREE FROM HIS MASTER

WHY IS LIGHT GIVEN TO HIM WHO IS IN MISERY AND LIFE TO THE BITTER IN SOUL WHO LONG FOR DEATH BUT IT COMES NOT AND DIG FOR IT MORE THAN FOR HIDDEN TREASURES WHO REJOICE EXCEEDINGLY AND ARE GLAD WHEN THEY FIND THE GRAVE

WHY IS LIGHT GIVEN TO A MAN WHOSE WAY IS HIDDEN WHOM GOD HAS HEDGED IN

FOR MY SIGHING COMES INSTEAD OF MY BREAD AND MY GROANINGS ARE POURED OUT LIKE WATER

FOR THE THING THAT I FEAR COMES UPON ME AND WHAT I DREAD BEFALLS ME

I AM NOT AT EASE NOR AM I QUIET; I HAVE NO REST BUT TROUBLE COMES

THEN ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE ANSWERED AND SAID IF ONE VENTURES A WORD WITH YOU WILL YOU BE IMPATIENT

YET WHO CAN KEEP FROM SPEAKING

BEHOLD YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED MANY AND YOU HAVE STRENGTHENED THE WEAK HANDS

YOUR WORDS HAVE UPHELD HIM WHO WAS STUMBLING AND YOU HAVE MADE FIRM THE FEEBLE KNEES

BUT NOW IT HAS COME TO YOU AND YOU ARE IMPATIENT; IT TOUCHES YOU AND YOU ARE DISMAYED

IS NOT YOUR FEAR OF GOD YOUR CONFIDENCE AND THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR WAYS YOUR HOPE

REMEMBER WHO THAT WAS INNOCENT EVER PERISHED

OR WHERE WERE THE UPRIGHT CUT OFF

AS I HAVE SEEN THOSE WHO PLOW INIQUITY AND SOW TROUBLE REAP THE SAME

BY THE BREATH OF GOD THEY PERISH AND BY THE BLAST OF HIS ANGER THEY ARE CONSUMED

THE ROAR OF THE LION THE VOICE OF THE FIERCE LION THE TEETH OF THE YOUNG LIONS ARE BROKEN

THE STRONG LION PERISHES FOR LACK OF PREY AND THE CUBS OF THE LIONESS ARE SCATTERED

NOW A WORD WAS BROUGHT TO ME STEALTHILY; MY EAR RECEIVED THE WHISPER OF IT

AMID THOUGHTS FROM VISIONS OF THE NIGHT WHEN DEEP SLEEP FALLS ON MEN DREAD CAME UPON ME AND TREMBLING WHICH MADE ALL MY BONES SHAKE

A SPIRIT GLIDED PAST MY FACE; THE HAIR OF MY FLESH STOOD UP

IT STOOD STILL BUT I COULD NOT DISCERN ITS APPEARANCE

A FORM WAS BEFORE MY EYES; THERE WAS SILENCE THEN I HEARD A VOICE 'CAN MORTAL MAN BE IN THE RIGHT BEFORE GOD

CAN A MAN BE PURE BEFORE HIS MAKER

EVEN IN HIS SERVANTS HE PUTS NO TRUST AND HIS ANGELS HE CHARGES WITH ERROR; HOW MUCH MORE THOSE WHO DWELL IN HOUSES OF CLAY WHOSE FOUNDATION IS IN THE DUST WHO ARE CRUSHED LIKE THE MOTH

BETWEEN MORNING AND EVENING THEY ARE BEATEN TO PIECES; THEY PERISH FOREVER WITHOUT ANYONE REGARDING IT

IS NOT THEIR TENTCORD PLUCKED UP WITHIN THEM DO THEY NOT DIE AND THAT WITHOUT WISDOM

'CALL NOW; IS THERE ANYONE WHO WILL ANSWER YOU

TO WHICH OF THE HOLY ONES WILL YOU TURN

SURELY VEXATION KILLS THE FOOL AND JEALOUSY SLAYS THE SIMPLE

I HAVE SEEN THE FOOL TAKING ROOT BUT SUDDENLY I CURSED HIS DWELLING

HIS CHILDREN ARE FAR FROM SAFETY; THEY ARE CRUSHED IN THE GATE AND THERE IS NO ONE TO DELIVER THEM

THE HUNGRY EAT HIS HARVEST AND HE TAKES IT EVEN OUT OF THORNS AND THE THIRSTY PANT AFTER HIS WEALTH

FOR AFFLICTION DOES NOT COME FROM THE DUST NOR DOES TROUBLE SPROUT FROM THE GROUND BUT MAN IS BORN TO TROUBLE AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD

AS FOR ME I WOULD SEEK GOD AND TO GOD WOULD I COMMIT MY CAUSE WHO DOES GREAT THINGS AND UNSEARCHABLE MARVELOUS THINGS WITHOUT NUMBER HE GIVES RAIN ON THE EARTH AND SENDS WATERS ON THE FIELDS; HE SETS ON HIGH THOSE WHO ARE LOWLY AND THOSE WHO MOURN ARE LIFTED TO SAFETY

HE FRUSTRATES THE DEVICES OF THE CRAFTY SO THAT THEIR HANDS ACHIEVE NO SUCCESS

HE CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR OWN CRAFTINESS AND THE SCHEMES OF THE WILY ARE BROUGHT TO A QUICK END

THEY MEET WITH DARKNESS IN THE DAYTIME AND GROPE AT NOONDAY AS IN THE NIGHT

BUT HE SAVES THE NEEDY FROM THE SWORD OF THEIR MOUTH AND FROM THE HAND OF THE MIGHTY

SO THE POOR HAVE HOPE AND INJUSTICE SHUTS HER MOUTH

BEHOLD BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOM GOD REPROVES; THEREFORE DESPISE NOT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE ALMIGHTY

FOR HE WOUNDS BUT HE BINDS UP; HE SHATTERS BUT HIS HANDS HEAL

HE WILL DELIVER YOU FROM SIX TROUBLES; IN SEVEN NO EVIL SHALL TOUCH YOU

IN FAMINE HE WILL REDEEM YOU FROM DEATH AND IN WAR FROM THE POWER OF THE SWORD

YOU SHALL BE HIDDEN FROM THE LASH OF THE TONGUE AND SHALL NOT FEAR DESTRUCTION WHEN IT COMES

AT DESTRUCTION AND FAMINE YOU SHALL LAUGH AND SHALL NOT FEAR THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

FOR YOU SHALL BE IN LEAGUE WITH THE STONES OF THE FIELD AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD SHALL BE AT PEACE WITH YOU

YOU SHALL KNOW THAT YOUR TENT IS AT PEACE AND YOU SHALL INSPECT YOUR FOLD AND MISS NOTHING

YOU SHALL KNOW ALSO THAT YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL BE MANY AND YOUR DESCENDANTS AS THE GRASS OF THE EARTH

YOU SHALL COME TO YOUR GRAVE IN RIPE OLD AGE LIKE A SHEAF GATHERED UP IN ITS SEASON

BEHOLD THIS WE HAVE SEARCHED OUT; IT IS TRUE

HEAR AND KNOW IT FOR YOUR GOOD

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID OH THAT MY VEXATION WERE WEIGHED AND ALL MY CALAMITY LAID IN THE BALANCES

FOR THEN IT WOULD BE HEAVIER THAN THE SAND OF THE SEA; THEREFORE MY WORDS HAVE BEEN RASH

FOR THE ARROWS OF THE ALMIGHTY ARE IN ME; MY SPIRIT DRINKS THEIR POISON; THE TERRORS OF GOD ARE ARRAYED AGAINST ME

DOES THE WILD DONKEY BRAY WHEN HE HAS GRASS OR THE OX LOW OVER HIS FODDER

CAN THAT WHICH IS TASTELESS BE EATEN WITHOUT SALT OR IS THERE ANY TASTE IN THE JUICE OF THE MALLOW

MY APPETITE REFUSES TO TOUCH THEM; THEY ARE AS FOOD THAT IS LOATHSOME TO ME

OH THAT I MIGHT HAVE MY REQUEST AND THAT GOD WOULD FULFILL MY HOPE THAT IT WOULD PLEASE GOD TO CRUSH ME THAT HE WOULD LET LOOSE HIS HAND AND CUT ME OFF

THIS WOULD BE MY COMFORT; I WOULD EVEN EXULT IN PAIN UNSPARING FOR I HAVE NOT DENIED THE WORDS OF THE HOLY ONE

WHAT IS MY STRENGTH THAT I SHOULD WAIT

AND WHAT IS MY END THAT I SHOULD BE PATIENT

IS MY STRENGTH THE STRENGTH OF STONES OR IS MY FLESH BRONZE

HAVE I ANY HELP IN ME WHEN RESOURCE IS DRIVEN FROM ME

HE WHO WITHHOLDS KINDNESS FROM A FRIEND FORSAKES THE FEAR OF THE ALMIGHTY

MY BROTHERS ARE TREACHEROUS AS A TORRENTBED AS TORRENTIAL STREAMS THAT PASS AWAY WHICH ARE DARK WITH ICE AND WHERE THE SNOW HIDES ITSELF

WHEN THEY MELT THEY DISAPPEAR; WHEN IT IS HOT THEY VANISH FROM THEIR PLACE

THE CARAVANS TURN ASIDE FROM THEIR COURSE; THEY GO UP INTO THE WASTE AND PERISH

THE CARAVANS OF TEMA LOOK THE TRAVELERS OF SHEBA HOPE

THEY ARE ASHAMED BECAUSE THEY WERE CONFIDENT; THEY COME THERE AND ARE DISAPPOINTED

FOR YOU HAVE NOW BECOME NOTHING; YOU SEE MY CALAMITY AND ARE AFRAID

HAVE I SAID 'MAKE ME A GIFT'

OR 'FROM YOUR WEALTH OFFER A BRIBE FOR ME'

OR 'DELIVER ME FROM THE ADVERSARY'S HAND'

OR 'REDEEM ME FROM THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS'

TEACH ME AND I WILL BE SILENT; MAKE ME UNDERSTAND HOW I HAVE GONE ASTRAY

HOW FORCEFUL ARE UPRIGHT WORDS

BUT WHAT DOES REPROOF FROM YOU REPROVE

DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN REPROVE WORDS WHEN THE SPEECH OF A DESPAIRING MAN IS WIND

YOU WOULD EVEN CAST LOTS OVER THE FATHERLESS AND BARGAIN OVER YOUR FRIEND

BUT NOW BE PLEASED TO LOOK AT ME FOR I WILL NOT LIE TO YOUR FACE

PLEASE TURN; LET NO INJUSTICE BE DONE

TURN NOW; MY VINDICATION IS AT STAKE

IS THERE ANY INJUSTICE ON MY TONGUE

CANNOT MY PALATE DISCERN THE CAUSE OF CALAMITY

HAS NOT MAN A HARD SERVICE ON EARTH AND ARE NOT HIS DAYS LIKE THE DAYS OF A HIRED HAND

LIKE A SLAVE WHO LONGS FOR THE SHADOW AND LIKE A HIRED HAND WHO LOOKS FOR HIS WAGES SO I AM ALLOTTED MONTHS OF EMPTINESS AND NIGHTS OF MISERY ARE APPORTIONED TO ME

WHEN I LIE DOWN I SAY 'WHEN SHALL I ARISE

' BUT THE NIGHT IS LONG AND I AM FULL OF TOSSING TILL THE DAWN

MY FLESH IS CLOTHED WITH WORMS AND DIRT; MY SKIN HARDENS THEN BREAKS OUT AFRESH

MY DAYS ARE SWIFTER THAN A WEAVER'S SHUTTLE AND COME TO THEIR END WITHOUT HOPE

REMEMBER THAT MY LIFE IS A BREATH; MY EYE WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE GOOD

THE EYE OF HIM WHO SEES ME WILL BEHOLD ME NO MORE; WHILE YOUR EYES ARE ON ME I SHALL BE GONE

AS THE CLOUD FADES AND VANISHES SO HE WHO GOES DOWN TO SHEOL DOES NOT COME UP; HE RETURNS NO MORE TO HIS HOUSE NOR DOES HIS PLACE KNOW HIM ANYMORE

THEREFORE I WILL NOT RESTRAIN MY MOUTH; I WILL SPEAK IN THE ANGUISH OF MY SPIRIT; I WILL COMPLAIN IN THE BITTERNESS OF MY SOUL

AM I THE SEA OR A SEA MONSTER THAT YOU SET A GUARD OVER ME

WHEN I SAY 'MY BED WILL COMFORT ME MY COUCH WILL EASE MY COMPLAINT' THEN YOU SCARE ME WITH DREAMS AND TERRIFY ME WITH VISIONS SO THAT I WOULD CHOOSE STRANGLING AND DEATH RATHER THAN MY BONES

I LOATHE MY LIFE; I WOULD NOT LIVE FOREVER

LEAVE ME ALONE FOR MY DAYS ARE A BREATH

WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU MAKE SO MUCH OF HIM AND THAT YOU SET YOUR HEART ON HIM VISIT HIM EVERY MORNING AND TEST HIM EVERY MOMENT

HOW LONG WILL YOU NOT LOOK AWAY FROM ME NOR LEAVE ME ALONE TILL I SWALLOW MY SPIT

IF I SIN WHAT DO I DO TO YOU YOU WATCHER OF MANKIND

WHY HAVE YOU MADE ME YOUR MARK

WHY HAVE I BECOME A BURDEN TO YOU

WHY DO YOU NOT PARDON MY TRANSGRESSION AND TAKE AWAY MY INIQUITY

FOR NOW I SHALL LIE IN THE EARTH; YOU WILL SEEK ME BUT I SHALL NOT BE

THEN BILDAD THE SHUHITE ANSWERED AND SAID HOW LONG WILL YOU SAY THESE THINGS AND THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH BE A GREAT WIND

DOES GOD PERVERT JUSTICE

OR DOES THE ALMIGHTY PERVERT THE RIGHT

IF YOUR CHILDREN HAVE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE HAS DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR TRANSGRESSION

IF YOU WILL SEEK GOD AND PLEAD WITH THE ALMIGHTY FOR MERCY IF YOU ARE PURE AND UPRIGHT SURELY THEN HE WILL ROUSE HIMSELF FOR YOU AND RESTORE YOUR RIGHTFUL HABITATION

AND THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS SMALL YOUR LATTER DAYS WILL BE VERY GREAT

FOR INQUIRE PLEASE OF BYGONE AGES AND CONSIDER WHAT THE FATHERS HAVE SEARCHED OUT

FOR WE ARE BUT OF YESTERDAY AND KNOW NOTHING FOR OUR DAYS ON EARTH ARE A SHADOW

WILL THEY NOT TEACH YOU AND TELL YOU AND UTTER WORDS OUT OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING

CAN PAPYRUS GROW WHERE THERE IS NO MARSH

CAN REEDS FLOURISH WHERE THERE IS NO WATER

WHILE YET IN FLOWER AND NOT CUT DOWN THEY WITHER BEFORE ANY OTHER PLANT

SUCH ARE THE PATHS OF ALL WHO FORGET GOD; THE HOPE OF THE GODLESS SHALL PERISH

HIS CONFIDENCE IS SEVERED AND HIS TRUST IS A SPIDER'S WEB

HE LEANS AGAINST HIS HOUSE BUT IT DOES NOT STAND; HE LAYS HOLD OF IT BUT IT DOES NOT ENDURE

HE IS A LUSH PLANT BEFORE THE SUN AND HIS SHOOTS SPREAD OVER HIS GARDEN

HIS ROOTS ENTWINE THE STONE HEAP; HE LOOKS UPON A HOUSE OF STONES

IF HE IS DESTROYED FROM HIS PLACE THEN IT WILL DENY HIM SAYING 'I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU

' BEHOLD THIS IS THE JOY OF HIS WAY AND OUT OF THE SOIL OTHERS WILL SPRING

BEHOLD GOD WILL NOT REJECT A BLAMELESS MAN NOR TAKE THE HAND OF EVILDOERS

HE WILL YET FILL YOUR MOUTH WITH LAUGHTER AND YOUR LIPS WITH SHOUTING

THOSE WHO HATE YOU WILL BE CLOTHED WITH SHAME AND THE TENT OF THE WICKED WILL BE NO MORE

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID TRULY I KNOW THAT IT IS SO BUT HOW CAN A MAN BE IN THE RIGHT BEFORE GOD

IF ONE WISHED TO CONTEND WITH HIM ONE COULD NOT ANSWER HIM ONCE IN A THOUSAND TIMES

HE IS WISE IN HEART AND MIGHTY IN STRENGTHWHO HAS HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST HIM AND SUCCEEDED

 HE WHO REMOVES MOUNTAINS AND THEY KNOW IT NOT WHEN HE OVERTURNS THEM IN HIS ANGER WHO SHAKES THE EARTH OUT OF ITS PLACE AND ITS PILLARS TREMBLE; WHO COMMANDS THE SUN AND IT DOES NOT RISE; WHO SEALS UP THE STARS; WHO ALONE STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS AND TRAMPLED THE WAVES OF THE SEA; WHO MADE THE BEAR AND ORION THE PLEIADES AND THE CHAMBERS OF THE SOUTH; WHO DOES GREAT THINGS BEYOND SEARCHING OUT AND MARVELOUS THINGS BEYOND NUMBER

BEHOLD HE PASSES BY ME AND I SEE HIM NOT; HE MOVES ON BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE HIM

BEHOLD HE SNATCHES AWAY; WHO CAN TURN HIM BACK

WHO WILL SAY TO HIM 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING

' GOD WILL NOT TURN BACK HIS ANGER; BENEATH HIM BOWED THE HELPERS OF RAHAB

HOW THEN CAN I ANSWER HIM CHOOSING MY WORDS WITH HIM

THOUGH I AM IN THE RIGHT I CANNOT ANSWER HIM; I MUST APPEAL FOR MERCY TO MY ACCUSER

IF I SUMMONED HIM AND HE ANSWERED ME I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS LISTENING TO MY VOICE

FOR HE CRUSHES ME WITH A TEMPEST AND MULTIPLIES MY WOUNDS WITHOUT CAUSE; HE WILL NOT LET ME GET MY BREATH BUT FILLS ME WITH BITTERNESS

IF IT IS A CONTEST OF STRENGTH BEHOLD HE IS MIGHTY

IF IT IS A MATTER OF JUSTICE WHO CAN SUMMON HIM

THOUGH I AM IN THE RIGHT MY OWN MOUTH WOULD CONDEMN ME; THOUGH I AM BLAMELESS HE WOULD PROVE ME PERVERSE

I AM BLAMELESS; I REGARD NOT MYSELF; I LOATHE MY LIFE

IT IS ALL ONE; THEREFORE I SAY HE DESTROYS BOTH THE BLAMELESS AND THE WICKED

WHEN DISASTER BRINGS SUDDEN DEATH HE MOCKS AT THE CALAMITY OF THE INNOCENT

THE EARTH IS GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE WICKED; HE COVERS THE FACES OF ITS JUDGESIF IT IS NOT HE WHO THEN IS IT

MY DAYS ARE SWIFTER THAN A RUNNER; THEY FLEE AWAY; THEY SEE NO GOOD

THEY GO BY LIKE SKIFFS OF REED LIKE AN EAGLE SWOOPING ON THE PREY

IF I SAY 'I WILL FORGET MY COMPLAINT I WILL PUT OFF MY SAD FACE AND BE OF GOOD CHEER' I BECOME AFRAID OF ALL MY SUFFERING FOR I KNOW YOU WILL NOT HOLD ME INNOCENT

I SHALL BE CONDEMNED; WHY THEN DO I LABOR IN VAIN

IF I WASH MYSELF WITH SNOW AND CLEANSE MY HANDS WITH LYE YET YOU WILL PLUNGE ME INTO A PIT AND MY OWN CLOTHES WILL ABHOR ME

FOR HE IS NOT A MAN AS I AM THAT I MIGHT ANSWER HIM THAT WE SHOULD COME TO TRIAL TOGETHER

THERE IS NO ARBITER BETWEEN US WHO MIGHT LAY HIS HAND ON US BOTH

LET HIM TAKE HIS ROD AWAY FROM ME AND LET NOT DREAD OF HIM TERRIFY ME

THEN I WOULD SPEAK WITHOUT FEAR OF HIM FOR I AM NOT SO IN MYSELF

I LOATHE MY LIFE; I WILL GIVE FREE UTTERANCE TO MY COMPLAINT; I WILL SPEAK IN THE BITTERNESS OF MY SOUL

I WILL SAY TO GOD DO NOT CONDEMN ME; LET ME KNOW WHY YOU CONTEND AGAINST ME

DOES IT SEEM GOOD TO YOU TO OPPRESS TO DESPISE THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS AND FAVOR THE DESIGNS OF THE WICKED

HAVE YOU EYES OF FLESH

DO YOU SEE AS MAN SEES

ARE YOUR DAYS AS THE DAYS OF MAN OR YOUR YEARS AS A MAN'S YEARS THAT YOU SEEK OUT MY INIQUITY AND SEARCH FOR MY SIN ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THAT I AM NOT GUILTY AND THERE IS NONE TO DELIVER OUT OF YOUR HAND

YOUR HANDS FASHIONED AND MADE ME AND NOW YOU HAVE DESTROYED ME ALTOGETHER

REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE MADE ME LIKE CLAY; AND WILL YOU RETURN ME TO THE DUST

DID YOU NOT POUR ME OUT LIKE MILK AND CURDLE ME LIKE CHEESE

YOU CLOTHED ME WITH SKIN AND FLESH AND KNIT ME TOGETHER WITH BONES AND SINEWS

YOU HAVE GRANTED ME LIFE AND STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR CARE HAS PRESERVED MY SPIRIT

YET THESE THINGS YOU HID IN YOUR HEART; I KNOW THAT THIS WAS YOUR PURPOSE

IF I SIN YOU WATCH ME AND DO NOT ACQUIT ME OF MY INIQUITY

IF I AM GUILTY WOE TO ME

IF I AM IN THE RIGHT I CANNOT LIFT UP MY HEAD FOR I AM FILLED WITH DISGRACE AND LOOK ON MY AFFLICTION

AND WERE MY HEAD LIFTED UP YOU WOULD HUNT ME LIKE A LION AND AGAIN WORK WONDERS AGAINST ME

YOU RENEW YOUR WITNESSES AGAINST ME AND INCREASE YOUR VEXATION TOWARD ME; YOU BRING FRESH TROOPS AGAINST ME

WHY DID YOU BRING ME OUT FROM THE WOMB

WOULD THAT I HAD DIED BEFORE ANY EYE HAD SEEN ME AND WERE AS THOUGH I HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED FROM THE WOMB TO THE GRAVE

ARE NOT MY DAYS FEW

THEN CEASE AND LEAVE ME ALONE THAT I MAY FIND A LITTLE CHEER BEFORE I GOAND I SHALL NOT RETURNTO THE LAND OF DARKNESS AND DEEP SHADOW THE LAND OF GLOOM LIKE THICK DARKNESS LIKE DEEP SHADOW WITHOUT ANY ORDER WHERE LIGHT IS AS THICK DARKNESS

THEN ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE ANSWERED AND SAID SHOULD A MULTITUDE OF WORDS GO UNANSWERED AND A MAN FULL OF TALK BE JUDGED RIGHT

SHOULD YOUR BABBLE SILENCE MEN AND WHEN YOU MOCK SHALL NO ONE SHAME YOU

FOR YOU SAY 'MY DOCTRINE IS PURE AND I AM CLEAN IN GOD'S EYES

' BUT OH THAT GOD WOULD SPEAK AND OPEN HIS LIPS TO YOU AND THAT HE WOULD TELL YOU THE SECRETS OF WISDOM

FOR HE IS MANIFOLD IN UNDERSTANDING

KNOW THEN THAT GOD EXACTS OF YOU LESS THAN YOUR GUILT DESERVES

CAN YOU FIND OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD

CAN YOU FIND OUT THE LIMIT OF THE ALMIGHTY

IT IS HIGHER THAN HEAVENWHAT CAN YOU DO

DEEPER THAN SHEOLWHAT CAN YOU KNOW

ITS MEASURE IS LONGER THAN THE EARTH AND BROADER THAN THE SEA

IF HE PASSES THROUGH AND IMPRISONS AND SUMMONS THE COURT WHO CAN TURN HIM BACK

FOR HE KNOWS WORTHLESS MEN; WHEN HE SEES INIQUITY WILL HE NOT CONSIDER IT

BUT A STUPID MAN WILL GET UNDERSTANDING WHEN A WILD DONKEY'S COLT IS BORN A MAN

IF YOU PREPARE YOUR HEART YOU WILL STRETCH OUT YOUR HANDS TOWARD HIM

IF INIQUITY IS IN YOUR HAND PUT IT FAR AWAY AND LET NOT INJUSTICE DWELL IN YOUR TENTS

SURELY THEN YOU WILL LIFT UP YOUR FACE WITHOUT BLEMISH; YOU WILL BE SECURE AND WILL NOT FEAR

YOU WILL FORGET YOUR MISERY; YOU WILL REMEMBER IT AS WATERS THAT HAVE PASSED AWAY

AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE BRIGHTER THAN THE NOONDAY; ITS DARKNESS WILL BE LIKE THE MORNING

AND YOU WILL FEEL SECURE BECAUSE THERE IS HOPE; YOU WILL LOOK AROUND AND TAKE YOUR REST IN SECURITY

YOU WILL LIE DOWN AND NONE WILL MAKE YOU AFRAID; MANY WILL COURT YOUR FAVOR

BUT THE EYES OF THE WICKED WILL FAIL; ALL WAY OF ESCAPE WILL BE LOST TO THEM AND THEIR HOPE IS TO BREATHE THEIR LAST

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID NO DOUBT YOU ARE THE PEOPLE AND WISDOM WILL DIE WITH YOU

BUT I HAVE UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS YOU; I AM NOT INFERIOR TO YOU

WHO DOES NOT KNOW SUCH THINGS AS THESE

I AM A LAUGHINGSTOCK TO MY FRIENDS; I WHO CALLED TO GOD AND HE ANSWERED ME A JUST AND BLAMELESS MAN AM A LAUGHINGSTOCK

IN THE THOUGHT OF ONE WHO IS AT EASE THERE IS CONTEMPT FOR MISFORTUNE; IT IS READY FOR THOSE WHOSE FEET SLIP

THE TENTS OF ROBBERS ARE AT PEACE AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD ARE SECURE WHO BRING THEIR GOD IN THEIR HAND

BUT ASK THE BEASTS AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU; THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND THEY WILL TELL YOU; OR THE BUSHES OF THE EARTH AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU; AND THE FISH OF THE SEA WILL DECLARE TO YOU

WHO AMONG ALL THESE DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE HAND OF THE LORD HAS DONE THIS

IN HIS HAND IS THE LIFE OF EVERY LIVING THING AND THE BREATH OF ALL MANKIND

DOES NOT THE EAR TEST WORDS AS THE PALATE TASTES FOOD

WISDOM IS WITH THE AGED AND UNDERSTANDING IN LENGTH OF DAYS

WITH GOD ARE WISDOM AND MIGHT; HE HAS COUNSEL AND UNDERSTANDING

IF HE TEARS DOWN NONE CAN REBUILD; IF HE SHUTS A MAN IN NONE CAN OPEN

IF HE WITHHOLDS THE WATERS THEY DRY UP; IF HE SENDS THEM OUT THEY OVERWHELM THE LAND

WITH HIM ARE STRENGTH AND SOUND WISDOM; THE DECEIVED AND THE DECEIVER ARE HIS

HE LEADS COUNSELORS AWAY STRIPPED AND JUDGES HE MAKES FOOLS

HE LOOSES THE BONDS OF KINGS AND BINDS A WAISTCLOTH ON THEIR HIPS

HE LEADS PRIESTS AWAY STRIPPED AND OVERTHROWS THE MIGHTY

HE DEPRIVES OF SPEECH THOSE WHO ARE TRUSTED AND TAKES AWAY THE DISCERNMENT OF THE ELDERS

HE POURS CONTEMPT ON PRINCES AND LOOSENS THE BELT OF THE STRONG

HE UNCOVERS THE DEEPS OUT OF DARKNESS AND BRINGS DEEP DARKNESS TO LIGHT

HE MAKES NATIONS GREAT AND HE DESTROYS THEM; HE ENLARGES NATIONS AND LEADS THEM AWAY

HE TAKES AWAY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE CHIEFS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH AND MAKES THEM WANDER IN A PATHLESS WASTE

THEY GROPE IN THE DARK WITHOUT LIGHT AND HE MAKES THEM STAGGER LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN

BEHOLD MY EYE HAS SEEN ALL THIS MY EAR HAS HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD IT

WHAT YOU KNOW I ALSO KNOW; I AM NOT INFERIOR TO YOU

BUT I WOULD SPEAK TO THE ALMIGHTY AND I DESIRE TO ARGUE MY CASE WITH GOD

AS FOR YOU YOU WHITEWASH WITH LIES; WORTHLESS PHYSICIANS ARE YOU ALL

OH THAT YOU WOULD KEEP SILENT AND IT WOULD BE YOUR WISDOM

HEAR NOW MY ARGUMENT AND LISTEN TO THE PLEADINGS OF MY LIPS

WILL YOU SPEAK FALSELY FOR GOD AND SPEAK DECEITFULLY FOR HIM

WILL YOU SHOW PARTIALITY TOWARD HIM

WILL YOU PLEAD THE CASE FOR GOD

WILL IT BE WELL WITH YOU WHEN HE SEARCHES YOU OUT

OR CAN YOU DECEIVE HIM AS ONE DECEIVES A MAN

HE WILL SURELY REBUKE YOU IF IN SECRET YOU SHOW PARTIALITY

WILL NOT HIS MAJESTY TERRIFY YOU AND THE DREAD OF HIM FALL UPON YOU

YOUR MAXIMS ARE PROVERBS OF ASHES; YOUR DEFENSES ARE DEFENSES OF CLAY

LET ME HAVE SILENCE AND I WILL SPEAK AND LET COME ON ME WHAT MAY

WHY SHOULD I TAKE MY FLESH IN MY TEETH AND PUT MY LIFE IN MY HAND

THOUGH HE SLAY ME I WILL HOPE IN HIM; YET I WILL ARGUE MY WAYS TO HIS FACE

THIS WILL BE MY SALVATION THAT THE GODLESS SHALL NOT COME BEFORE HIM

KEEP LISTENING TO MY WORDS AND LET MY DECLARATION BE IN YOUR EARS

BEHOLD I HAVE PREPARED MY CASE; I KNOW THAT I SHALL BE IN THE RIGHT

WHO IS THERE WHO WILL CONTEND WITH ME

FOR THEN I WOULD BE SILENT AND DIE

ONLY GRANT ME TWO THINGS THEN I WILL NOT HIDE MYSELF FROM YOUR FACE WITHDRAW YOUR HAND FAR FROM ME AND LET NOT DREAD OF YOU TERRIFY ME

THEN CALL AND I WILL ANSWER; OR LET ME SPEAK AND YOU REPLY TO ME

HOW MANY ARE MY INIQUITIES AND MY SINS

MAKE ME KNOW MY TRANSGRESSION AND MY SIN

WHY DO YOU HIDE YOUR FACE AND COUNT ME AS YOUR ENEMY

WILL YOU FRIGHTEN A DRIVEN LEAF AND PURSUE DRY CHAFF

FOR YOU WRITE BITTER THINGS AGAINST ME AND MAKE ME INHERIT THE INIQUITIES OF MY YOUTH

YOU PUT MY FEET IN THE STOCKS AND WATCH ALL MY PATHS; YOU SET A LIMIT FOR THE SOLES OF MY FEET

MAN WASTES AWAY LIKE A ROTTEN THING LIKE A GARMENT THAT IS MOTHEATEN

MAN WHO IS BORN OF A WOMAN IS FEW OF DAYS AND FULL OF TROUBLE

HE COMES OUT LIKE A FLOWER AND WITHERS; HE FLEES LIKE A SHADOW AND CONTINUES NOT

AND DO YOU OPEN YOUR EYES ON SUCH A ONE AND BRING ME INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOU

WHO CAN BRING A CLEAN THING OUT OF AN UNCLEAN

THERE IS NOT ONE

SINCE HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED AND THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS IS WITH YOU AND YOU HAVE APPOINTED HIS LIMITS THAT HE CANNOT PASS LOOK AWAY FROM HIM AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THAT HE MAY ENJOY LIKE A HIRED HAND HIS DAY

FOR THERE IS HOPE FOR A TREE IF IT BE CUT DOWN THAT IT WILL SPROUT AGAIN AND THAT ITS SHOOTS WILL NOT CEASE

THOUGH ITS ROOT GROW OLD IN THE EARTH AND ITS STUMP DIE IN THE SOIL YET AT THE SCENT OF WATER IT WILL BUD AND PUT OUT BRANCHES LIKE A YOUNG PLANT

BUT A MAN DIES AND IS LAID LOW; MAN BREATHES HIS LAST AND WHERE IS HE

AS WATERS FAIL FROM A LAKE AND A RIVER WASTES AWAY AND DRIES UP SO A MAN LIES DOWN AND RISES NOT AGAIN; TILL THE HEAVENS ARE NO MORE HE WILL NOT AWAKE OR BE ROUSED OUT OF HIS SLEEP

OH THAT YOU WOULD HIDE ME IN SHEOL THAT YOU WOULD CONCEAL ME UNTIL YOUR WRATH BE PAST THAT YOU WOULD APPOINT ME A SET TIME AND REMEMBER ME

IF A MAN DIES SHALL HE LIVE AGAIN

ALL THE DAYS OF MY SERVICE I WOULD WAIT TILL MY RENEWAL SHOULD COME

YOU WOULD CALL AND I WOULD ANSWER YOU; YOU WOULD LONG FOR THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

FOR THEN YOU WOULD NUMBER MY STEPS; YOU WOULD NOT KEEP WATCH OVER MY SIN; MY TRANSGRESSION WOULD BE SEALED UP IN A BAG AND YOU WOULD COVER OVER MY INIQUITY

BUT THE MOUNTAIN FALLS AND CRUMBLES AWAY AND THE ROCK IS REMOVED FROM ITS PLACE; THE WATERS WEAR AWAY THE STONES; THE TORRENTS WASH AWAY THE SOIL OF THE EARTH; SO YOU DESTROY THE HOPE OF MAN

YOU PREVAIL FOREVER AGAINST HIM AND HE PASSES; YOU CHANGE HIS COUNTENANCE AND SEND HIM AWAY

HIS SONS COME TO HONOR AND HE DOES NOT KNOW IT; THEY ARE BROUGHT LOW AND HE PERCEIVES IT NOT

HE FEELS ONLY THE PAIN OF HIS OWN BODY AND HE MOURNS ONLY FOR HIMSELF

THEN ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE ANSWERED AND SAID SHOULD A WISE MAN ANSWER WITH WINDY KNOWLEDGE AND FILL HIS BELLY WITH THE EAST WIND

SHOULD HE ARGUE IN UNPROFITABLE TALK OR IN WORDS WITH WHICH HE CAN DO NO GOOD

BUT YOU ARE DOING AWAY WITH THE FEAR OF GOD AND HINDERING MEDITATION BEFORE GOD

FOR YOUR INIQUITY TEACHES YOUR MOUTH AND YOU CHOOSE THE TONGUE OF THE CRAFTY

YOUR OWN MOUTH CONDEMNS YOU AND NOT I; YOUR OWN LIPS TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

ARE YOU THE FIRST MAN WHO WAS BORN

OR WERE YOU BROUGHT FORTH BEFORE THE HILLS

HAVE YOU LISTENED IN THE COUNCIL OF GOD

AND DO YOU LIMIT WISDOM TO YOURSELF

WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT WE DO NOT KNOW

WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT CLEAR TO US

BOTH THE GRAYHAIRED AND THE AGED ARE AMONG US OLDER THAN YOUR FATHER

ARE THE COMFORTS OF GOD TOO SMALL FOR YOU OR THE WORD THAT DEALS GENTLY WITH YOU

WHY DOES YOUR HEART CARRY YOU AWAY AND WHY DO YOUR EYES FLASH THAT YOU TURN YOUR SPIRIT AGAINST GOD AND BRING SUCH WORDS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

WHAT IS MAN THAT HE CAN BE PURE

OR HE WHO IS BORN OF A WOMAN THAT HE CAN BE RIGHTEOUS

BEHOLD GOD PUTS NO TRUST IN HIS HOLY ONES AND THE HEAVENS ARE NOT PURE IN HIS SIGHT; HOW MUCH LESS ONE WHO IS ABOMINABLE AND CORRUPT A MAN WHO DRINKS INJUSTICE LIKE WATER

I WILL SHOW YOU; HEAR ME AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN I WILL DECLARE WHAT WISE MEN HAVE TOLD WITHOUT HIDING IT FROM THEIR FATHERS TO WHOM ALONE THE LAND WAS GIVEN AND NO STRANGER PASSED AMONG THEM

THE WICKED MAN WRITHES IN PAIN ALL HIS DAYS THROUGH ALL THE YEARS THAT ARE LAID UP FOR THE RUTHLESS

DREADFUL SOUNDS ARE IN HIS EARS; IN PROSPERITY THE DESTROYER WILL COME UPON HIM

HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WILL RETURN OUT OF DARKNESS AND HE IS MARKED FOR THE SWORD

HE WANDERS ABROAD FOR BREAD SAYING 'WHERE IS IT

' HE KNOWS THAT A DAY OF DARKNESS IS READY AT HIS HAND; DISTRESS AND ANGUISH TERRIFY HIM; THEY PREVAIL AGAINST HIM LIKE A KING READY FOR BATTLE

BECAUSE HE HAS STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AGAINST GOD AND DEFIES THE ALMIGHTY RUNNING STUBBORNLY AGAINST HIM WITH A THICKLY BOSSED SHIELD; BECAUSE HE HAS COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS FAT AND GATHERED FAT UPON HIS WAIST AND HAS LIVED IN DESOLATE CITIES IN HOUSES THAT NONE SHOULD INHABIT WHICH WERE READY TO BECOME HEAPS OF RUINS; HE WILL NOT BE RICH AND HIS WEALTH WILL NOT ENDURE NOR WILL HIS POSSESSIONS SPREAD OVER THE EARTH; HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM DARKNESS; THE FLAME WILL DRY UP HIS SHOOTS AND BY THE BREATH OF HIS MOUTH HE WILL DEPART

LET HIM NOT TRUST IN EMPTINESS DECEIVING HIMSELF FOR EMPTINESS WILL BE HIS PAYMENT

IT WILL BE PAID IN FULL BEFORE HIS TIME AND HIS BRANCH WILL NOT BE GREEN

HE WILL SHAKE OFF HIS UNRIPE GRAPE LIKE THE VINE AND CAST OFF HIS BLOSSOM LIKE THE OLIVE TREE

FOR THE COMPANY OF THE GODLESS IS BARREN AND FIRE CONSUMES THE TENTS OF BRIBERY

THEY CONCEIVE TROUBLE AND GIVE BIRTH TO EVIL AND THEIR WOMB PREPARES DECEIT

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID I HAVE HEARD MANY SUCH THINGS; MISERABLE COMFORTERS ARE YOU ALL

SHALL WINDY WORDS HAVE AN END

OR WHAT PROVOKES YOU THAT YOU ANSWER

I ALSO COULD SPEAK AS YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE; I COULD JOIN WORDS TOGETHER AGAINST YOU AND SHAKE MY HEAD AT YOU

I COULD STRENGTHEN YOU WITH MY MOUTH AND THE SOLACE OF MY LIPS WOULD ASSUAGE YOUR PAIN

IF I SPEAK MY PAIN IS NOT ASSUAGED AND IF I FORBEAR HOW MUCH OF IT LEAVES ME

SURELY NOW GOD HAS WORN ME OUT; HE HAS MADE DESOLATE ALL MY COMPANY

AND HE HAS SHRIVELED ME UP WHICH IS A WITNESS AGAINST ME AND MY LEANNESS HAS RISEN UP AGAINST ME; IT TESTIFIES TO MY FACE

HE HAS TORN ME IN HIS WRATH AND HATED ME; HE HAS GNASHED HIS TEETH AT ME; MY ADVERSARY SHARPENS HIS EYES AGAINST ME

MEN HAVE GAPED AT ME WITH THEIR MOUTH; THEY HAVE STRUCK ME INSOLENTLY ON THE CHEEK; THEY MASS THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST ME

GOD GIVES ME UP TO THE UNGODLY AND CASTS ME INTO THE HANDS OF THE WICKED

I WAS AT EASE AND HE BROKE ME APART; HE SEIZED ME BY THE NECK AND DASHED ME TO PIECES; HE SET ME UP AS HIS TARGET; HIS ARCHERS SURROUND ME

HE SLASHES OPEN MY KIDNEYS AND DOES NOT SPARE; HE POURS OUT MY GALL ON THE GROUND

HE BREAKS ME WITH BREACH UPON BREACH; HE RUNS UPON ME LIKE A WARRIOR

I HAVE SEWED SACKCLOTH UPON MY SKIN AND HAVE LAID MY STRENGTH IN THE DUST

MY FACE IS RED WITH WEEPING AND ON MY EYELIDS IS DEEP DARKNESS ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO VIOLENCE IN MY HANDS AND MY PRAYER IS PURE

O EARTH COVER NOT MY BLOOD AND LET MY CRY FIND NO RESTING PLACE

EVEN NOW BEHOLD MY WITNESS IS IN HEAVEN AND HE WHO TESTIFIES FOR ME IS ON HIGH

MY FRIENDS SCORN ME; MY EYE POURS OUT TEARS TO GOD THAT HE WOULD ARGUE THE CASE OF A MAN WITH GOD AS A SON OF MAN DOES WITH HIS NEIGHBOR

FOR WHEN A FEW YEARS HAVE COME I SHALL GO THE WAY FROM WHICH I SHALL NOT RETURN

MY SPIRIT IS BROKEN; MY DAYS ARE EXTINCT; THE GRAVEYARD IS READY FOR ME

SURELY THERE ARE MOCKERS ABOUT ME AND MY EYE DWELLS ON THEIR PROVOCATION

LAY DOWN A PLEDGE FOR ME WITH YOURSELF; WHO IS THERE WHO WILL PUT UP SECURITY FOR ME

SINCE YOU HAVE CLOSED THEIR HEARTS TO UNDERSTANDING THEREFORE YOU WILL NOT LET THEM TRIUMPH

HE WHO INFORMS AGAINST HIS FRIENDS TO GET A SHARE OF THEIR PROPERTYTHE EYES OF HIS CHILDREN WILL FAIL

HE HAS MADE ME A BYWORD OF THE PEOPLES AND I AM ONE BEFORE WHOM MEN SPIT

MY EYE HAS GROWN DIM FROM VEXATION AND ALL MY MEMBERS ARE LIKE A SHADOW

THE UPRIGHT ARE APPALLED AT THIS AND THE INNOCENT STIRS HIMSELF UP AGAINST THE GODLESS

YET THE RIGHTEOUS HOLDS TO HIS WAY AND HE WHO HAS CLEAN HANDS GROWS STRONGER AND STRONGER

BUT YOU COME ON AGAIN ALL OF YOU AND I SHALL NOT FIND A WISE MAN AMONG YOU

MY DAYS ARE PAST; MY PLANS ARE BROKEN OFF THE DESIRES OF MY HEART

THEY MAKE NIGHT INTO DAY; 'THE LIGHT' THEY SAY 'IS NEAR TO THE DARKNESS

' IF I HOPE FOR SHEOL AS MY HOUSE IF I MAKE MY BED IN DARKNESS IF I SAY TO THE PIT 'YOU ARE MY FATHER' AND TO THE WORM 'MY MOTHER' OR 'MY SISTER' WHERE THEN IS MY HOPE

WHO WILL SEE MY HOPE

WILL IT GO DOWN TO THE BARS OF SHEOL

SHALL WE DESCEND TOGETHER INTO THE DUST

THEN BILDAD THE SHUHITE ANSWERED AND SAID HOW LONG WILL YOU HUNT FOR WORDS

CONSIDER AND THEN WE WILL SPEAK

WHY ARE WE COUNTED AS CATTLE

WHY ARE WE STUPID IN YOUR SIGHT

YOU WHO TEAR YOURSELF IN YOUR ANGER SHALL THE EARTH BE FORSAKEN FOR YOU OR THE ROCK BE REMOVED OUT OF ITS PLACE

INDEED THE LIGHT OF THE WICKED IS PUT OUT AND THE FLAME OF HIS FIRE DOES NOT SHINE

THE LIGHT IS DARK IN HIS TENT AND HIS LAMP ABOVE HIM IS PUT OUT

HIS STRONG STEPS ARE SHORTENED AND HIS OWN SCHEMES THROW HIM DOWN

FOR HE IS CAST INTO A NET BY HIS OWN FEET AND HE WALKS ON ITS MESH

A TRAP SEIZES HIM BY THE HEEL; A SNARE LAYS HOLD OF HIM

A ROPE IS HIDDEN FOR HIM IN THE GROUND A TRAP FOR HIM IN THE PATH

TERRORS FRIGHTEN HIM ON EVERY SIDE AND CHASE HIM AT HIS HEELS

HIS STRENGTH IS FAMISHED AND CALAMITY IS READY FOR HIS STUMBLING

IT CONSUMES THE PARTS OF HIS SKIN; THE FIRSTBORN OF DEATH CONSUMES HIS LIMBS

HE IS TORN FROM THE TENT IN WHICH HE TRUSTED AND IS BROUGHT TO THE KING OF TERRORS

IN HIS TENT DWELLS THAT WHICH IS NONE OF HIS; SULFUR IS SCATTERED OVER HIS HABITATION

HIS ROOTS DRY UP BENEATH AND HIS BRANCHES WITHER ABOVE

HIS MEMORY PERISHES FROM THE EARTH AND HE HAS NO NAME IN THE STREET

HE IS THRUST FROM LIGHT INTO DARKNESS AND DRIVEN OUT OF THE WORLD

HE HAS NO POSTERITY OR PROGENY AMONG HIS PEOPLE AND NO SURVIVOR WHERE HE USED TO LIVE

THEY OF THE WEST ARE APPALLED AT HIS DAY AND HORROR SEIZES THEM OF THE EAST

SURELY SUCH ARE THE DWELLINGS OF THE UNRIGHTEOUS SUCH IS THE PLACE OF HIM WHO KNOWS NOT GOD

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID HOW LONG WILL YOU TORMENT ME AND BREAK ME IN PIECES WITH WORDS

THESE TEN TIMES YOU HAVE CAST REPROACH UPON ME; ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO WRONG ME

AND EVEN IF IT BE TRUE THAT I HAVE ERRED MY ERROR REMAINS WITH MYSELF

IF INDEED YOU MAGNIFY YOURSELVES AGAINST ME AND MAKE MY DISGRACE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ME KNOW THEN THAT GOD HAS PUT ME IN THE WRONG AND CLOSED HIS NET ABOUT ME

BEHOLD I CRY OUT 'VIOLENCE

' BUT I AM NOT ANSWERED; I CALL FOR HELP BUT THERE IS NO JUSTICE

HE HAS WALLED UP MY WAY SO THAT I CANNOT PASS AND HE HAS SET DARKNESS UPON MY PATHS

HE HAS STRIPPED FROM ME MY GLORY AND TAKEN THE CROWN FROM MY HEAD

HE BREAKS ME DOWN ON EVERY SIDE AND I AM GONE AND MY HOPE HAS HE PULLED UP LIKE A TREE

HE HAS KINDLED HIS WRATH AGAINST ME AND COUNTS ME AS HIS ADVERSARY

HIS TROOPS COME ON TOGETHER; THEY HAVE CAST UP THEIR SIEGE RAMP AGAINST ME AND ENCAMP AROUND MY TENT

HE HAS PUT MY BROTHERS FAR FROM ME AND THOSE WHO KNEW ME ARE WHOLLY ESTRANGED FROM ME

MY RELATIVES HAVE FAILED ME MY CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE FORGOTTEN ME

THE GUESTS IN MY HOUSE AND MY MAIDSERVANTS COUNT ME AS A STRANGER; I HAVE BECOME A FOREIGNER IN THEIR EYES

I CALL TO MY SERVANT BUT HE GIVES ME NO ANSWER; I MUST PLEAD WITH HIM WITH MY MOUTH FOR MERCY

MY BREATH IS STRANGE TO MY WIFE AND I AM A STENCH TO THE CHILDREN OF MY OWN MOTHER

EVEN YOUNG CHILDREN DESPISE ME; WHEN I RISE THEY TALK AGAINST ME

ALL MY INTIMATE FRIENDS ABHOR ME AND THOSE WHOM I LOVED HAVE TURNED AGAINST ME

MY BONES STICK TO MY SKIN AND TO MY FLESH AND I HAVE ESCAPED BY THE SKIN OF MY TEETH

HAVE MERCY ON ME HAVE MERCY ON ME O YOU MY FRIENDS FOR THE HAND OF GOD HAS TOUCHED ME

WHY DO YOU LIKE GOD PURSUE ME

WHY ARE YOU NOT SATISFIED WITH MY FLESH

OH THAT MY WORDS WERE WRITTEN

OH THAT THEY WERE INSCRIBED IN A BOOK

OH THAT WITH AN IRON PEN AND LEAD THEY WERE ENGRAVED IN THE ROCK FOREVER

FOR I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES AND AT THE LAST HE WILL STAND UPON THE EARTH

AND AFTER MY SKIN HAS BEEN THUS DESTROYED YET IN MY FLESH I SHALL SEE GOD WHOM I SHALL SEE FOR MYSELF AND MY EYES SHALL BEHOLD AND NOT ANOTHER

MY HEART FAINTS WITHIN ME

IF YOU SAY 'HOW WE WILL PURSUE HIM

' AND 'THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IS FOUND IN HIM' BE AFRAID OF THE SWORD FOR WRATH BRINGS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE SWORD THAT YOU MAY KNOW THERE IS A JUDGMENT

THEN ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE ANSWERED AND SAID THEREFORE MY THOUGHTS ANSWER ME BECAUSE OF MY HASTE WITHIN ME

I HEAR CENSURE THAT INSULTS ME AND OUT OF MY UNDERSTANDING A SPIRIT ANSWERS ME

DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS FROM OF OLD SINCE MAN WAS PLACED ON EARTH THAT THE EXULTING OF THE WICKED IS SHORT AND THE JOY OF THE GODLESS BUT FOR A MOMENT

THOUGH HIS HEIGHT MOUNT UP TO THE HEAVENS AND HIS HEAD REACH TO THE CLOUDS HE WILL PERISH FOREVER LIKE HIS OWN DUNG; THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN HIM WILL SAY 'WHERE IS HE

' HE WILL FLY AWAY LIKE A DREAM AND NOT BE FOUND; HE WILL BE CHASED AWAY LIKE A VISION OF THE NIGHT

THE EYE THAT SAW HIM WILL SEE HIM NO MORE NOR WILL HIS PLACE ANY MORE BEHOLD HIM

HIS CHILDREN WILL SEEK THE FAVOR OF THE POOR AND HIS HANDS WILL GIVE BACK HIS WEALTH

HIS BONES ARE FULL OF HIS YOUTHFUL VIGOR BUT IT WILL LIE DOWN WITH HIM IN THE DUST

THOUGH EVIL IS SWEET IN HIS MOUTH THOUGH HE HIDES IT UNDER HIS TONGUE THOUGH HE IS LOATH TO LET IT GO AND HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH YET HIS FOOD IS TURNED IN HIS STOMACH; IT IS THE VENOM OF COBRAS WITHIN HIM

HE SWALLOWS DOWN RICHES AND VOMITS THEM UP AGAIN; GOD CASTS THEM OUT OF HIS BELLY

HE WILL SUCK THE POISON OF COBRAS; THE TONGUE OF A VIPER WILL KILL HIM

HE WILL NOT LOOK UPON THE RIVERS THE STREAMS FLOWING WITH HONEY AND CURDS

HE WILL GIVE BACK THE FRUIT OF HIS TOIL AND WILL NOT SWALLOW IT DOWN; FROM THE PROFIT OF HIS TRADING HE WILL GET NO ENJOYMENT

FOR HE HAS CRUSHED AND ABANDONED THE POOR; HE HAS SEIZED A HOUSE THAT HE DID NOT BUILD

BECAUSE HE KNEW NO CONTENTMENT IN HIS BELLY HE WILL NOT LET ANYTHING IN WHICH HE DELIGHTS ESCAPE HIM

THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT AFTER HE HAD EATEN; THEREFORE HIS PROSPERITY WILL NOT ENDURE

IN THE FULLNESS OF HIS SUFFICIENCY HE WILL BE IN DISTRESS; THE HAND OF EVERYONE IN MISERY WILL COME AGAINST HIM

TO FILL HIS BELLY TO THE FULL GOD WILL SEND HIS BURNING ANGER AGAINST HIM AND RAIN IT UPON HIM INTO HIS BODY

HE WILL FLEE FROM AN IRON WEAPON; A BRONZE ARROW WILL STRIKE HIM THROUGH

IT IS DRAWN FORTH AND COMES OUT OF HIS BODY; THE GLITTERING POINT COMES OUT OF HIS GALLBLADDER; TERRORS COME UPON HIM

UTTER DARKNESS IS LAID UP FOR HIS TREASURES; A FIRE NOT FANNED WILL DEVOUR HIM; WHAT IS LEFT IN HIS TENT WILL BE CONSUMED

THE HEAVENS WILL REVEAL HIS INIQUITY AND THE EARTH WILL RISE UP AGAINST HIM

THE POSSESSIONS OF HIS HOUSE WILL BE CARRIED AWAY DRAGGED OFF IN THE DAY OF GOD'S WRATH

THIS IS THE WICKED MAN'S PORTION FROM GOD THE HERITAGE DECREED FOR HIM BY GOD

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID KEEP LISTENING TO MY WORDS AND LET THIS BE YOUR COMFORT

BEAR WITH ME AND I WILL SPEAK AND AFTER I HAVE SPOKEN MOCK ON

AS FOR ME IS MY COMPLAINT AGAINST MAN

WHY SHOULD I NOT BE IMPATIENT

LOOK AT ME AND BE APPALLED AND LAY YOUR HAND OVER YOUR MOUTH

WHEN I REMEMBER I AM DISMAYED AND SHUDDERING SEIZES MY FLESH

WHY DO THE WICKED LIVE REACH OLD AGE AND GROW MIGHTY IN POWER

THEIR OFFSPRING ARE ESTABLISHED IN THEIR PRESENCE AND THEIR DESCENDANTS BEFORE THEIR EYES

THEIR HOUSES ARE SAFE FROM FEAR AND NO ROD OF GOD IS UPON THEM

THEIR BULL BREEDS WITHOUT FAIL; THEIR COW CALVES AND DOES NOT MISCARRY

THEY SEND OUT THEIR LITTLE BOYS LIKE A FLOCK AND THEIR CHILDREN DANCE

THEY SING TO THE TAMBOURINE AND THE LYRE AND REJOICE TO THE SOUND OF THE PIPE

THEY SPEND THEIR DAYS IN PROSPERITY AND IN PEACE THEY GO DOWN TO SHEOL

THEY SAY TO GOD 'DEPART FROM US

WE DO NOT DESIRE THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR WAYS

WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM

AND WHAT PROFIT DO WE GET IF WE PRAY TO HIM

' BEHOLD IS NOT THEIR PROSPERITY IN THEIR HAND

THE COUNSEL OF THE WICKED IS FAR FROM ME

HOW OFTEN IS IT THAT THE LAMP OF THE WICKED IS PUT OUT

THAT THEIR CALAMITY COMES UPON THEM

THAT GOD DISTRIBUTES PAINS IN HIS ANGER

THAT THEY ARE LIKE STRAW BEFORE THE WIND AND LIKE CHAFF THAT THE STORM CARRIES AWAY

YOU SAY 'GOD STORES UP THEIR INIQUITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN

' LET HIM PAY IT OUT TO THEM THAT THEY MAY KNOW IT

LET THEIR OWN EYES SEE THEIR DESTRUCTION AND LET THEM DRINK OF THE WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY

FOR WHAT DO THEY CARE FOR THEIR HOUSES AFTER THEM WHEN THE NUMBER OF THEIR MONTHS IS CUT OFF

WILL ANY TEACH GOD KNOWLEDGE SEEING THAT HE JUDGES THOSE WHO ARE ON HIGH

ONE DIES IN HIS FULL VIGOR BEING WHOLLY AT EASE AND SECURE HIS PAILS FULL OF MILK AND THE MARROW OF HIS BONES MOIST

ANOTHER DIES IN BITTERNESS OF SOUL NEVER HAVING TASTED OF PROSPERITY

THEY LIE DOWN ALIKE IN THE DUST AND THE WORMS COVER THEM

BEHOLD I KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS AND YOUR SCHEMES TO WRONG ME

FOR YOU SAY 'WHERE IS THE HOUSE OF THE PRINCE

WHERE IS THE TENT IN WHICH THE WICKED LIVED

' HAVE YOU NOT ASKED THOSE WHO TRAVEL THE ROADS AND DO YOU NOT ACCEPT THEIR TESTIMONY THAT THE EVIL MAN IS SPARED IN THE DAY OF CALAMITY THAT HE IS RESCUED IN THE DAY OF WRATH

WHO DECLARES HIS WAY TO HIS FACE AND WHO REPAYS HIM FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE

WHEN HE IS CARRIED TO THE GRAVE WATCH IS KEPT OVER HIS TOMB

THE CLODS OF THE VALLEY ARE SWEET TO HIM; ALL MANKIND FOLLOWS AFTER HIM AND THOSE WHO GO BEFORE HIM ARE INNUMERABLE

HOW THEN WILL YOU COMFORT ME WITH EMPTY NOTHINGS

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF YOUR ANSWERS BUT FALSEHOOD

THEN ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE ANSWERED AND SAID CAN A MAN BE PROFITABLE TO GOD

SURELY HE WHO IS WISE IS PROFITABLE TO HIMSELF

IS IT ANY PLEASURE TO THE ALMIGHTY IF YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT OR IS IT GAIN TO HIM IF YOU MAKE YOUR WAYS BLAMELESS

IS IT FOR YOUR FEAR OF HIM THAT HE REPROVES YOU AND ENTERS INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOU

IS NOT YOUR EVIL ABUNDANT

THERE IS NO END TO YOUR INIQUITIES

FOR YOU HAVE EXACTED PLEDGES OF YOUR BROTHERS FOR NOTHING AND STRIPPED THE NAKED OF THEIR CLOTHING

YOU HAVE GIVEN NO WATER TO THE WEARY TO DRINK AND YOU HAVE WITHHELD BREAD FROM THE HUNGRY

THE MAN WITH POWER POSSESSED THE LAND AND THE FAVORED MAN LIVED IN IT

YOU HAVE SENT WIDOWS AWAY EMPTY AND THE ARMS OF THE FATHERLESS WERE CRUSHED

THEREFORE SNARES ARE ALL AROUND YOU AND SUDDEN TERROR OVERWHELMS YOU OR DARKNESS SO THAT YOU CANNOT SEE AND A FLOOD OF WATER COVERS YOU

IS NOT GOD HIGH IN THE HEAVENS

SEE THE HIGHEST STARS HOW LOFTY THEY ARE

BUT YOU SAY 'WHAT DOES GOD KNOW

CAN HE JUDGE THROUGH THE DEEP DARKNESS

THICK CLOUDS VEIL HIM SO THAT HE DOES NOT SEE AND HE WALKS ON THE VAULT OF HEAVEN

' WILL YOU KEEP TO THE OLD WAY THAT WICKED MEN HAVE TROD

THEY WERE SNATCHED AWAY BEFORE THEIR TIME; THEIR FOUNDATION WAS WASHED AWAY

THEY SAID TO GOD 'DEPART FROM US' AND 'WHAT CAN THE ALMIGHTY DO TO US

' YET HE FILLED THEIR HOUSES WITH GOOD THINGSBUT THE COUNSEL OF THE WICKED IS FAR FROM ME

THE RIGHTEOUS SEE IT AND ARE GLAD; THE INNOCENT ONE MOCKS AT THEM SAYING 'SURELY OUR ADVERSARIES ARE CUT OFF AND WHAT THEY LEFT THE FIRE HAS CONSUMED

' AGREE WITH GOD AND BE AT PEACE; THEREBY GOOD WILL COME TO YOU

RECEIVE INSTRUCTION FROM HIS MOUTH AND LAY UP HIS WORDS IN YOUR HEART

IF YOU RETURN TO THE ALMIGHTY YOU WILL BE BUILT UP; IF YOU REMOVE INJUSTICE FAR FROM YOUR TENTS IF YOU LAY GOLD IN THE DUST AND GOLD OF OPHIR AMONG THE STONES OF THE TORRENT BED THEN THE ALMIGHTY WILL BE YOUR GOLD AND YOUR PRECIOUS SILVER

FOR THEN YOU WILL DELIGHT YOURSELF IN THE ALMIGHTY AND LIFT UP YOUR FACE TO GOD

YOU WILL MAKE YOUR PRAYER TO HIM AND HE WILL HEAR YOU AND YOU WILL PAY YOUR VOWS

YOU WILL DECIDE ON A MATTER AND IT WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR YOU AND LIGHT WILL SHINE ON YOUR WAYS

FOR WHEN THEY ARE HUMBLED YOU SAY 'IT IS BECAUSE OF PRIDE'; BUT HE SAVES THE LOWLY

HE DELIVERS EVEN THE ONE WHO IS NOT INNOCENT WHO WILL BE DELIVERED THROUGH THE CLEANNESS OF YOUR HANDS

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID TODAY ALSO MY COMPLAINT IS BITTER; MY HAND IS HEAVY ON ACCOUNT OF MY GROANING

OH THAT I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM THAT I MIGHT COME EVEN TO HIS SEAT

I WOULD LAY MY CASE BEFORE HIM AND FILL MY MOUTH WITH ARGUMENTS

I WOULD KNOW WHAT HE WOULD ANSWER ME AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO ME

WOULD HE CONTEND WITH ME IN THE GREATNESS OF HIS POWER

NO; HE WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO ME

THERE AN UPRIGHT MAN COULD ARGUE WITH HIM AND I WOULD BE ACQUITTED FOREVER BY MY JUDGE

BEHOLD I GO FORWARD BUT HE IS NOT THERE AND BACKWARD BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE HIM; ON THE LEFT HAND WHEN HE IS WORKING I DO NOT BEHOLD HIM; HE TURNS TO THE RIGHT HAND BUT I DO NOT SEE HIM

BUT HE KNOWS THE WAY THAT I TAKE; WHEN HE HAS TRIED ME I SHALL COME OUT AS GOLD

MY FOOT HAS HELD FAST TO HIS STEPS; I HAVE KEPT HIS WAY AND HAVE NOT TURNED ASIDE

I HAVE NOT DEPARTED FROM THE COMMANDMENT OF HIS LIPS; I HAVE TREASURED THE WORDS OF HIS MOUTH MORE THAN MY PORTION OF FOOD

BUT HE IS UNCHANGEABLE AND WHO CAN TURN HIM BACK

WHAT HE DESIRES THAT HE DOES

FOR HE WILL COMPLETE WHAT HE APPOINTS FOR ME AND MANY SUCH THINGS ARE IN HIS MIND

THEREFORE I AM TERRIFIED AT HIS PRESENCE; WHEN I CONSIDER I AM IN DREAD OF HIM

GOD HAS MADE MY HEART FAINT; THE ALMIGHTY HAS TERRIFIED ME; YET I AM NOT SILENCED BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS NOR BECAUSE THICK DARKNESS COVERS MY FACE

WHY ARE NOT TIMES OF JUDGMENT KEPT BY THE ALMIGHTY AND WHY DO THOSE WHO KNOW HIM NEVER SEE HIS DAYS

SOME MOVE LANDMARKS; THEY SEIZE FLOCKS AND PASTURE THEM

THEY DRIVE AWAY THE DONKEY OF THE FATHERLESS; THEY TAKE THE WIDOW'S OX FOR A PLEDGE

THEY THRUST THE POOR OFF THE ROAD; THE POOR OF THE EARTH ALL HIDE THEMSELVES

BEHOLD LIKE WILD DONKEYS IN THE DESERT THE POOR GO OUT TO THEIR TOIL SEEKING GAME; THE WASTELAND YIELDS FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN

THEY GATHER THEIR FODDER IN THE FIELD AND THEY GLEAN THE VINEYARD OF THE WICKED MAN

THEY LIE ALL NIGHT NAKED WITHOUT CLOTHING AND HAVE NO COVERING IN THE COLD

THEY ARE WET WITH THE RAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS AND CLING TO THE ROCK FOR LACK OF SHELTER

THERE ARE THOSE WHO SNATCH THE FATHERLESS CHILD FROM THE BREAST AND THEY TAKE A PLEDGE AGAINST THE POOR

 THEY GO ABOUT NAKED WITHOUT CLOTHING; HUNGRY THEY CARRY THE SHEAVES; AMONG THE OLIVE ROWS OF THE WICKED THEY MAKE OIL; THEY TREAD THE WINEPRESSES BUT SUFFER THIRST

FROM OUT OF THE CITY THE DYING GROAN AND THE SOUL OF THE WOUNDED CRIES FOR HELP; YET GOD CHARGES NO ONE WITH WRONG

THERE ARE THOSE WHO REBEL AGAINST THE LIGHT WHO ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ITS WAYS AND DO NOT STAY IN ITS PATHS

THE MURDERER RISES BEFORE IT IS LIGHT THAT HE MAY KILL THE POOR AND NEEDY AND IN THE NIGHT HE IS LIKE A THIEF

THE EYE OF THE ADULTERER ALSO WAITS FOR THE TWILIGHT SAYING 'NO EYE WILL SEE ME'; AND HE VEILS HIS FACE

IN THE DARK THEY DIG THROUGH HOUSES; BY DAY THEY SHUT THEMSELVES UP; THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LIGHT

FOR DEEP DARKNESS IS MORNING TO ALL OF THEM; FOR THEY ARE FRIENDS WITH THE TERRORS OF DEEP DARKNESS

YOU SAY 'SWIFT ARE THEY ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS; THEIR PORTION IS CURSED IN THE LAND; NO TREADER TURNS TOWARD THEIR VINEYARDS

DROUGHT AND HEAT SNATCH AWAY THE SNOW WATERS; SO DOES SHEOL THOSE WHO HAVE SINNED

THE WOMB FORGETS THEM; THE WORM FINDS THEM SWEET; THEY ARE NO LONGER REMEMBERED SO WICKEDNESS IS BROKEN LIKE A TREE

' THEY WRONG THE BARREN CHILDLESS WOMAN AND DO NO GOOD TO THE WIDOW

YET GOD PROLONGS THE LIFE OF THE MIGHTY BY HIS POWER; THEY RISE UP WHEN THEY DESPAIR OF LIFE

HE GIVES THEM SECURITY AND THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND HIS EYES ARE UPON THEIR WAYS

THEY ARE EXALTED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN ARE GONE; THEY ARE BROUGHT LOW AND GATHERED UP LIKE ALL OTHERS; THEY ARE CUT OFF LIKE THE HEADS OF GRAIN

IF IT IS NOT SO WHO WILL PROVE ME A LIAR AND SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN WHAT I SAY

THEN BILDAD THE SHUHITE ANSWERED AND SAID DOMINION AND FEAR ARE WITH GOD; HE MAKES PEACE IN HIS HIGH HEAVEN

IS THERE ANY NUMBER TO HIS ARMIES

UPON WHOM DOES HIS LIGHT NOT ARISE

HOW THEN CAN MAN BE IN THE RIGHT BEFORE GOD

HOW CAN HE WHO IS BORN OF WOMAN BE PURE

BEHOLD EVEN THE MOON IS NOT BRIGHT AND THE STARS ARE NOT PURE IN HIS EYES; HOW MUCH LESS MAN WHO IS A MAGGOT AND THE SON OF MAN WHO IS A WORM

THEN JOB ANSWERED AND SAID HOW YOU HAVE HELPED HIM WHO HAS NO POWER

HOW YOU HAVE SAVED THE ARM THAT HAS NO STRENGTH

HOW YOU HAVE COUNSELED HIM WHO HAS NO WISDOM AND PLENTIFULLY DECLARED SOUND KNOWLEDGE

WITH WHOSE HELP HAVE YOU UTTERED WORDS AND WHOSE BREATH HAS COME OUT FROM YOU

THE DEAD TREMBLE UNDER THE WATERS AND THEIR INHABITANTS

SHEOL IS NAKED BEFORE GOD AND ABADDON HAS NO COVERING

HE STRETCHES OUT THE NORTH OVER THE VOID AND HANGS THE EARTH ON NOTHING

HE BINDS UP THE WATERS IN HIS THICK CLOUDS AND THE CLOUD IS NOT SPLIT OPEN UNDER THEM

HE COVERS THE FACE OF THE FULL MOON AND SPREADS OVER IT HIS CLOUD

HE HAS INSCRIBED A CIRCLE ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS

THE PILLARS OF HEAVEN TREMBLE AND ARE ASTOUNDED AT HIS REBUKE

BY HIS POWER HE STILLED THE SEA; BY HIS UNDERSTANDING HE SHATTERED RAHAB

BY HIS WIND THE HEAVENS WERE MADE FAIR; HIS HAND PIERCED THE FLEEING SERPENT

BEHOLD THESE ARE BUT THE OUTSKIRTS OF HIS WAYS AND HOW SMALL A WHISPER DO WE HEAR OF HIM

BUT THE THUNDER OF HIS POWER WHO CAN UNDERSTAND

AND JOB AGAIN TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID AS GOD LIVES WHO HAS TAKEN AWAY MY RIGHT AND THE ALMIGHTY WHO HAS MADE MY SOUL BITTER AS LONG AS MY BREATH IS IN ME AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS IN MY NOSTRILS MY LIPS WILL NOT SPEAK FALSEHOOD AND MY TONGUE WILL NOT UTTER DECEIT

FAR BE IT FROM ME TO SAY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT; TILL I DIE I WILL NOT PUT AWAY MY INTEGRITY FROM ME

I HOLD FAST MY RIGHTEOUSNESS AND WILL NOT LET IT GO; MY HEART DOES NOT REPROACH ME FOR ANY OF MY DAYS

LET MY ENEMY BE AS THE WICKED AND LET HIM WHO RISES UP AGAINST ME BE AS THE UNRIGHTEOUS

FOR WHAT IS THE HOPE OF THE GODLESS WHEN GOD CUTS HIM OFF WHEN GOD TAKES AWAY HIS LIFE

WILL GOD HEAR HIS CRY WHEN DISTRESS COMES UPON HIM

WILL HE TAKE DELIGHT IN THE ALMIGHTY

WILL HE CALL UPON GOD AT ALL TIMES

I WILL TEACH YOU CONCERNING THE HAND OF GOD; WHAT IS WITH THE ALMIGHTY I WILL NOT CONCEAL

BEHOLD ALL OF YOU HAVE SEEN IT YOURSELVES; WHY THEN HAVE YOU BECOME ALTOGETHER VAIN

THIS IS THE PORTION OF A WICKED MAN WITH GOD AND THE HERITAGE THAT OPPRESSORS RECEIVE FROM THE ALMIGHTY IF HIS CHILDREN ARE MULTIPLIED IT IS FOR THE SWORD AND HIS DESCENDANTS HAVE NOT ENOUGH BREAD

THOSE WHO SURVIVE HIM THE PESTILENCE BURIES AND HIS WIDOWS DO NOT WEEP

THOUGH HE HEAP UP SILVER LIKE DUST AND PILE UP CLOTHING LIKE CLAY HE MAY PILE IT UP BUT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL WEAR IT AND THE INNOCENT WILL DIVIDE THE SILVER

HE BUILDS HIS HOUSE LIKE A MOTH'S LIKE A BOOTH THAT A WATCHMAN MAKES

HE GOES TO BED RICH BUT WILL DO SO NO MORE; HE OPENS HIS EYES AND HIS WEALTH IS GONE

TERRORS OVERTAKE HIM LIKE A FLOOD; IN THE NIGHT A WHIRLWIND CARRIES HIM OFF

THE EAST WIND LIFTS HIM UP AND HE IS GONE; IT SWEEPS HIM OUT OF HIS PLACE

IT HURLS AT HIM WITHOUT PITY; HE FLEES FROM ITS POWER IN HEADLONG FLIGHT

IT CLAPS ITS HANDS AT HIM AND HISSES AT HIM FROM ITS PLACE

SURELY THERE IS A MINE FOR SILVER AND A PLACE FOR GOLD THAT THEY REFINE

IRON IS TAKEN OUT OF THE EARTH AND COPPER IS SMELTED FROM THE ORE

MAN PUTS AN END TO DARKNESS AND SEARCHES OUT TO THE FARTHEST LIMIT THE ORE IN GLOOM AND DEEP DARKNESS

HE OPENS SHAFTS IN A VALLEY AWAY FROM WHERE ANYONE LIVES; THEY ARE FORGOTTEN BY TRAVELERS; THEY HANG IN THE AIR FAR AWAY FROM MANKIND; THEY SWING TO AND FRO

AS FOR THE EARTH OUT OF IT COMES BREAD BUT UNDERNEATH IT IS TURNED UP AS BY FIRE

ITS STONES ARE THE PLACE OF SAPPHIRES AND IT HAS DUST OF GOLD

THAT PATH NO BIRD OF PREY KNOWS AND THE FALCON'S EYE HAS NOT SEEN IT

THE PROUD BEASTS HAVE NOT TRODDEN IT; THE LION HAS NOT PASSED OVER IT

MAN PUTS HIS HAND TO THE FLINTY ROCK AND OVERTURNS MOUNTAINS BY THE ROOTS

HE CUTS OUT CHANNELS IN THE ROCKS AND HIS EYE SEES EVERY PRECIOUS THING

HE DAMS UP THE STREAMS SO THAT THEY DO NOT TRICKLE AND THE THING THAT IS HIDDEN HE BRINGS OUT TO LIGHT

BUT WHERE SHALL WISDOM BE FOUND

AND WHERE IS THE PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING

MAN DOES NOT KNOW ITS WORTH AND IT IS NOT FOUND IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING

THE DEEP SAYS 'IT IS NOT IN ME' AND THE SEA SAYS 'IT IS NOT WITH ME

' IT CANNOT BE BOUGHT FOR GOLD AND SILVER CANNOT BE WEIGHED AS ITS PRICE

IT CANNOT BE VALUED IN THE GOLD OF OPHIR IN PRECIOUS ONYX OR SAPPHIRE

GOLD AND GLASS CANNOT EQUAL IT NOR CAN IT BE EXCHANGED FOR JEWELS OF FINE GOLD

NO MENTION SHALL BE MADE OF CORAL OR OF CRYSTAL; THE PRICE OF WISDOM IS ABOVE PEARLS

THE TOPAZ OF ETHIOPIA CANNOT EQUAL IT NOR CAN IT BE VALUED IN PURE GOLD

FROM WHERE THEN DOES WISDOM COME

AND WHERE IS THE PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING

IT IS HIDDEN FROM THE EYES OF ALL LIVING AND CONCEALED FROM THE BIRDS OF THE AIR

ABADDON AND DEATH SAY 'WE HAVE HEARD A RUMOR OF IT WITH OUR EARS

' GOD UNDERSTANDS THE WAY TO IT AND HE KNOWS ITS PLACE

FOR HE LOOKS TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND SEES EVERYTHING UNDER THE HEAVENS

WHEN HE GAVE TO THE WIND ITS WEIGHT AND APPORTIONED THE WATERS BY MEASURE WHEN HE MADE A DECREE FOR THE RAIN AND A WAY FOR THE LIGHTNING OF THE THUNDER THEN HE SAW IT AND DECLARED IT; HE ESTABLISHED IT AND SEARCHED IT OUT

AND HE SAID TO MAN 'BEHOLD THE FEAR OF THE LORD THAT IS WISDOM AND TO TURN AWAY FROM EVIL IS UNDERSTANDING

'AND JOB AGAIN TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID OH THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME WHEN HIS LAMP SHONE UPON MY HEAD AND BY HIS LIGHT I WALKED THROUGH DARKNESS AS I WAS IN MY PRIME WHEN THE FRIENDSHIP OF GOD WAS UPON MY TENT WHEN THE ALMIGHTY WAS YET WITH ME WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE ALL AROUND ME WHEN MY STEPS WERE WASHED WITH BUTTER AND THE ROCK POURED OUT FOR ME STREAMS OF OIL

WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE GATE OF THE CITY WHEN I PREPARED MY SEAT IN THE SQUARE THE YOUNG MEN SAW ME AND WITHDREW AND THE AGED ROSE AND STOOD; THE PRINCES REFRAINED FROM TALKING AND LAID THEIR HAND ON THEIR MOUTH; THE VOICE OF THE NOBLES WAS HUSHED AND THEIR TONGUE STUCK TO THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTH

WHEN THE EAR HEARD IT CALLED ME BLESSED AND WHEN THE EYE SAW IT APPROVED BECAUSE I DELIVERED THE POOR WHO CRIED FOR HELP AND THE FATHERLESS WHO HAD NONE TO HELP HIM

THE BLESSING OF HIM WHO WAS ABOUT TO PERISH CAME UPON ME AND I CAUSED THE WIDOW'S HEART TO SING FOR JOY

I PUT ON RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IT CLOTHED ME; MY JUSTICE WAS LIKE A ROBE AND A TURBAN

I WAS EYES TO THE BLIND AND FEET TO THE LAME

I WAS A FATHER TO THE NEEDY AND I SEARCHED OUT THE CAUSE OF HIM WHOM I DID NOT KNOW

I BROKE THE FANGS OF THE UNRIGHTEOUS AND MADE HIM DROP HIS PREY FROM HIS TEETH

THEN I THOUGHT 'I SHALL DIE IN MY NEST AND I SHALL MULTIPLY MY DAYS AS THE SAND MY ROOTS SPREAD OUT TO THE WATERS WITH THE DEW ALL NIGHT ON MY BRANCHES MY GLORY FRESH WITH ME AND MY BOW EVER NEW IN MY HAND

' MEN LISTENED TO ME AND WAITED AND KEPT SILENCE FOR MY COUNSEL

AFTER I SPOKE THEY DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN AND MY WORD DROPPED UPON THEM

THEY WAITED FOR ME AS FOR THE RAIN AND THEY OPENED THEIR MOUTHS AS FOR THE SPRING RAIN

I SMILED ON THEM WHEN THEY HAD NO CONFIDENCE AND THE LIGHT OF MY FACE THEY DID NOT CAST DOWN

I CHOSE THEIR WAY AND SAT AS CHIEF AND I LIVED LIKE A KING AMONG HIS TROOPS LIKE ONE WHO COMFORTS MOURNERS

BUT NOW THEY LAUGH AT ME MEN WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN I WHOSE FATHERS I WOULD HAVE DISDAINED TO SET WITH THE DOGS OF MY FLOCK

WHAT COULD I GAIN FROM THE STRENGTH OF THEIR HANDS MEN WHOSE VIGOR IS GONE

THROUGH WANT AND HARD HUNGER THEY GNAW THE DRY GROUND BY NIGHT IN WASTE AND DESOLATION; THEY PICK SALTWORT AND THE LEAVES OF BUSHES AND THE ROOTS OF THE BROOM TREE FOR THEIR FOOD

THEY ARE DRIVEN OUT FROM HUMAN COMPANY; THEY SHOUT AFTER THEM AS AFTER A THIEF

IN THE GULLIES OF THE TORRENTS THEY MUST DWELL IN HOLES OF THE EARTH AND OF THE ROCKS

AMONG THE BUSHES THEY BRAY; UNDER THE NETTLES THEY HUDDLE TOGETHER

A SENSELESS A NAMELESS BROOD THEY HAVE BEEN WHIPPED OUT OF THE LAND

AND NOW I HAVE BECOME THEIR SONG; I AM A BYWORD TO THEM

THEY ABHOR ME; THEY KEEP ALOOF FROM ME; THEY DO NOT HESITATE TO SPIT AT THE SIGHT OF ME

BECAUSE GOD HAS LOOSED MY CORD AND HUMBLED ME THEY HAVE CAST OFF RESTRAINT IN MY PRESENCE

ON MY RIGHT HAND THE RABBLE RISE; THEY PUSH AWAY MY FEET; THEY CAST UP AGAINST ME THEIR WAYS OF DESTRUCTION

THEY BREAK UP MY PATH; THEY PROMOTE MY CALAMITY; THEY NEED NO ONE TO HELP THEM

AS THROUGH A WIDE BREACH THEY COME; AMID THE CRASH THEY ROLL ON

TERRORS ARE TURNED UPON ME; MY HONOR IS PURSUED AS BY THE WIND AND MY PROSPERITY HAS PASSED AWAY LIKE A CLOUD

AND NOW MY SOUL IS POURED OUT WITHIN ME; DAYS OF AFFLICTION HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF ME

THE NIGHT RACKS MY BONES AND THE PAIN THAT GNAWS ME TAKES NO REST

WITH GREAT FORCE MY GARMENT IS DISFIGURED; IT BINDS ME ABOUT LIKE THE COLLAR OF MY TUNIC

GOD HAS CAST ME INTO THE MIRE AND I HAVE BECOME LIKE DUST AND ASHES

I CRY TO YOU FOR HELP AND YOU DO NOT ANSWER ME; I STAND AND YOU ONLY LOOK AT ME

YOU HAVE TURNED CRUEL TO ME; WITH THE MIGHT OF YOUR HAND YOU PERSECUTE ME

YOU LIFT ME UP ON THE WIND; YOU MAKE ME RIDE ON IT AND YOU TOSS ME ABOUT IN THE ROAR OF THE STORM

FOR I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BRING ME TO DEATH AND TO THE HOUSE APPOINTED FOR ALL LIVING

YET DOES NOT ONE IN A HEAP OF RUINS STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AND IN HIS DISASTER CRY FOR HELP

DID NOT I WEEP FOR HIM WHOSE DAY WAS HARD

WAS NOT MY SOUL GRIEVED FOR THE NEEDY

BUT WHEN I HOPED FOR GOOD EVIL CAME AND WHEN I WAITED FOR LIGHT DARKNESS CAME

MY INWARD PARTS ARE IN TURMOIL AND NEVER STILL; DAYS OF AFFLICTION COME TO MEET ME

I GO ABOUT DARKENED BUT NOT BY THE SUN; I STAND UP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND CRY FOR HELP

I AM A BROTHER OF JACKALS AND A COMPANION OF OSTRICHES

MY SKIN TURNS BLACK AND FALLS FROM ME AND MY BONES BURN WITH HEAT

MY LYRE IS TURNED TO MOURNING AND MY PIPE TO THE VOICE OF THOSE WHO WEEP

I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH MY EYES; HOW THEN COULD I GAZE AT A VIRGIN

WHAT WOULD BE MY PORTION FROM GOD ABOVE AND MY HERITAGE FROM THE ALMIGHTY ON HIGH

IS NOT CALAMITY FOR THE UNRIGHTEOUS AND DISASTER FOR THE WORKERS OF INIQUITY

DOES NOT HE SEE MY WAYS AND NUMBER ALL MY STEPS

IF I HAVE WALKED WITH FALSEHOOD AND MY FOOT HAS HASTENED TO DECEIT; LET ME BE WEIGHED IN A JUST BALANCE AND LET GOD KNOW MY INTEGRITY

 IF MY STEP HAS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE WAY AND MY HEART HAS GONE AFTER MY EYES AND IF ANY SPOT HAS STUCK TO MY HANDS THEN LET ME SOW AND ANOTHER EAT AND LET WHAT GROWS FOR ME BE ROOTED OUT

IF MY HEART HAS BEEN ENTICED TOWARD A WOMAN AND I HAVE LAIN IN WAIT AT MY NEIGHBOR'S DOOR THEN LET MY WIFE GRIND FOR ANOTHER AND LET OTHERS BOW DOWN ON HER

FOR THAT WOULD BE A HEINOUS CRIME; THAT WOULD BE AN INIQUITY TO BE PUNISHED BY THE JUDGES; FOR THAT WOULD BE A FIRE THAT CONSUMES AS FAR AS ABADDON AND IT WOULD BURN TO THE ROOT ALL MY INCREASE

IF I HAVE REJECTED THE CAUSE OF MY MANSERVANT OR MY MAIDSERVANT WHEN THEY BROUGHT A COMPLAINT AGAINST ME WHAT THEN SHALL I DO WHEN GOD RISES UP

WHEN HE MAKES INQUIRY WHAT SHALL I ANSWER HIM

DID NOT HE WHO MADE ME IN THE WOMB MAKE HIM

AND DID NOT ONE FASHION US IN THE WOMB

IF I HAVE WITHHELD ANYTHING THAT THE POOR DESIRED OR HAVE CAUSED THE EYES OF THE WIDOW TO FAIL OR HAVE EATEN MY MORSEL ALONE AND THE FATHERLESS HAS NOT EATEN OF IT FOR FROM MY YOUTH THE FATHERLESS GREW UP WITH ME AS WITH A FATHER AND FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB I GUIDED THE WIDOW  IF I HAVE SEEN ANYONE PERISH FOR LACK OF CLOTHING OR THE NEEDY WITHOUT COVERING IF HIS BODY HAS NOT BLESSED ME AND IF HE WAS NOT WARMED WITH THE FLEECE OF MY SHEEP IF I HAVE RAISED MY HAND AGAINST THE FATHERLESS BECAUSE I SAW MY HELP IN THE GATE THEN LET MY SHOULDER BLADE FALL FROM MY SHOULDER AND LET MY ARM BE BROKEN FROM ITS SOCKET

FOR I WAS IN TERROR OF CALAMITY FROM GOD AND I COULD NOT HAVE FACED HIS MAJESTY

IF I HAVE MADE GOLD MY TRUST OR CALLED FINE GOLD MY CONFIDENCE IF I HAVE REJOICED BECAUSE MY WEALTH WAS ABUNDANT OR BECAUSE MY HAND HAD FOUND MUCH IF I HAVE LOOKED AT THE SUN WHEN IT SHONE OR THE MOON MOVING IN SPLENDOR AND MY HEART HAS BEEN SECRETLY ENTICED AND MY MOUTH HAS KISSED MY HAND THIS ALSO WOULD BE AN INIQUITY TO BE PUNISHED BY THE JUDGES FOR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FALSE TO GOD ABOVE

IF I HAVE REJOICED AT THE RUIN OF HIM WHO HATED ME OR EXULTED WHEN EVIL OVERTOOK HIM I HAVE NOT LET MY MOUTH SIN BY ASKING FOR HIS LIFE WITH A CURSE IF THE MEN OF MY TENT HAVE NOT SAID 'WHO IS THERE THAT HAS NOT BEEN FILLED WITH HIS MEAT

' THE SOJOURNER HAS NOT LODGED IN THE STREET; I HAVE OPENED MY DOORS TO THE TRAVELER IF I HAVE CONCEALED MY TRANSGRESSIONS AS OTHERS DO BY HIDING MY INIQUITY IN MY BOSOM BECAUSE I STOOD IN GREAT FEAR OF THE MULTITUDE AND THE CONTEMPT OF FAMILIES TERRIFIED ME SO THAT I KEPT SILENCE AND DID NOT GO OUT OF DOORS OH THAT I HAD ONE TO HEAR ME

HERE IS MY SIGNATURE

LET THE ALMIGHTY ANSWER ME

 OH THAT I HAD THE INDICTMENT WRITTEN BY MY ADVERSARY

SURELY I WOULD CARRY IT ON MY SHOULDER; I WOULD BIND IT ON ME AS A CROWN; I WOULD GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ALL MY STEPS; LIKE A PRINCE I WOULD APPROACH HIM

IF MY LAND HAS CRIED OUT AGAINST ME AND ITS FURROWS HAVE WEPT TOGETHER IF I HAVE EATEN ITS YIELD WITHOUT PAYMENT AND MADE ITS OWNERS BREATHE THEIR LAST LET THORNS GROW INSTEAD OF WHEAT AND FOUL WEEDS INSTEAD OF BARLEY

THE WORDS OF JOB ARE ENDED

SO THESE THREE MEN CEASED TO ANSWER JOB BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHTEOUS IN HIS OWN EYES

THEN ELIHU THE SON OF BARACHEL THE BUZITE OF THE FAMILY OF RAM BURNED WITH ANGER

HE BURNED WITH ANGER AT JOB BECAUSE HE JUSTIFIED HIMSELF RATHER THAN GOD

HE BURNED WITH ANGER ALSO AT JOB'S THREE FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUND NO ANSWER ALTHOUGH THEY HAD DECLARED JOB TO BE IN THE WRONG

NOW ELIHU HAD WAITED TO SPEAK TO JOB BECAUSE THEY WERE OLDER THAN HE

AND WHEN ELIHU SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ANSWER IN THE MOUTH OF THESE THREE MEN HE BURNED WITH ANGER

AND ELIHU THE SON OF BARACHEL THE BUZITE ANSWERED AND SAID I AM YOUNG IN YEARS AND YOU ARE AGED; THEREFORE I WAS TIMID AND AFRAID TO DECLARE MY OPINION TO YOU

I SAID 'LET DAYS SPEAK AND MANY YEARS TEACH WISDOM

' BUT IT IS THE SPIRIT IN MAN THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY THAT MAKES HIM UNDERSTAND

IT IS NOT THE OLD WHO ARE WISE NOR THE AGED WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS RIGHT

THEREFORE I SAY 'LISTEN TO ME; LET ME ALSO DECLARE MY OPINION

' BEHOLD I WAITED FOR YOUR WORDS I LISTENED FOR YOUR WISE SAYINGS WHILE YOU SEARCHED OUT WHAT TO SAY

I GAVE YOU MY ATTENTION AND BEHOLD THERE WAS NONE AMONG YOU WHO REFUTED JOB OR WHO ANSWERED HIS WORDS

BEWARE LEST YOU SAY 'WE HAVE FOUND WISDOM; GOD MAY VANQUISH HIM NOT A MAN

' HE HAS NOT DIRECTED HIS WORDS AGAINST ME AND I WILL NOT ANSWER HIM WITH YOUR SPEECHES

THEY ARE DISMAYED; THEY ANSWER NO MORE; THEY HAVE NOT A WORD TO SAY

AND SHALL I WAIT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SPEAK BECAUSE THEY STAND THERE AND ANSWER NO MORE

I ALSO WILL ANSWER WITH MY SHARE; I ALSO WILL DECLARE MY OPINION

FOR I AM FULL OF WORDS; THE SPIRIT WITHIN ME CONSTRAINS ME

BEHOLD MY BELLY IS LIKE WINE THAT HAS NO VENT; LIKE NEW WINESKINS READY TO BURST

I MUST SPEAK THAT I MAY FIND RELIEF; I MUST OPEN MY LIPS AND ANSWER

I WILL NOT SHOW PARTIALITY TO ANY MAN OR USE FLATTERY TOWARD ANY PERSON

FOR I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FLATTER ELSE MY MAKER WOULD SOON TAKE ME AWAY

BUT NOW HEAR MY SPEECH O JOB AND LISTEN TO ALL MY WORDS

BEHOLD I OPEN MY MOUTH; THE TONGUE IN MY MOUTH SPEAKS

MY WORDS DECLARE THE UPRIGHTNESS OF MY HEART AND WHAT MY LIPS KNOW THEY SPEAK SINCERELY

THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS MADE ME AND THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY GIVES ME LIFE

ANSWER ME IF YOU CAN; SET YOUR WORDS IN ORDER BEFORE ME; TAKE YOUR STAND

BEHOLD I AM TOWARD GOD AS YOU ARE; I TOO WAS PINCHED OFF FROM A PIECE OF CLAY

BEHOLD NO FEAR OF ME NEED TERRIFY YOU; MY PRESSURE WILL NOT BE HEAVY UPON YOU

SURELY YOU HAVE SPOKEN IN MY EARS AND I HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF YOUR WORDS

YOU SAY 'I AM PURE WITHOUT TRANSGRESSION; I AM CLEAN AND THERE IS NO INIQUITY IN ME

BEHOLD HE FINDS OCCASIONS AGAINST ME HE COUNTS ME AS HIS ENEMY HE PUTS MY FEET IN THE STOCKS AND WATCHES ALL MY PATHS

' BEHOLD IN THIS YOU ARE NOT RIGHT

I WILL ANSWER YOU FOR GOD IS GREATER THAN MAN

WHY DO YOU CONTEND AGAINST HIM SAYING 'HE WILL ANSWER NONE OF MAN'S WORDS'

FOR GOD SPEAKS IN ONE WAY AND IN TWO THOUGH MAN DOES NOT PERCEIVE IT

IN A DREAM IN A VISION OF THE NIGHT WHEN DEEP SLEEP FALLS ON MEN WHILE THEY SLUMBER ON THEIR BEDS THEN HE OPENS THE EARS OF MEN AND TERRIFIES THEM WITH WARNINGS THAT HE MAY TURN MAN ASIDE FROM HIS DEED AND CONCEAL PRIDE FROM A MAN; HE KEEPS BACK HIS SOUL FROM THE PIT HIS LIFE FROM PERISHING BY THE SWORD

MAN IS ALSO REBUKED WITH PAIN ON HIS BED AND WITH CONTINUAL STRIFE IN HIS BONES SO THAT HIS LIFE LOATHES BREAD AND HIS APPETITE THE CHOICEST FOOD

HIS FLESH IS SO WASTED AWAY THAT IT CANNOT BE SEEN AND HIS BONES THAT WERE NOT SEEN STICK OUT

HIS SOUL DRAWS NEAR THE PIT AND HIS LIFE TO THOSE WHO BRING DEATH

IF THERE BE FOR HIM AN ANGEL A MEDIATOR ONE OF THE THOUSAND TO DECLARE TO MAN WHAT IS RIGHT FOR HIM AND HE IS MERCIFUL TO HIM AND SAYS 'DELIVER HIM FROM GOING DOWN INTO THE PIT; I HAVE FOUND A RANSOM; LET HIS FLESH BECOME FRESH WITH YOUTH; LET HIM RETURN TO THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTHFUL VIGOR'; THEN MAN PRAYS TO GOD AND HE ACCEPTS HIM; HE SEES HIS FACE WITH A SHOUT OF JOY AND HE RESTORES TO MAN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS

HE SINGS BEFORE MEN AND SAYS 'I SINNED AND PERVERTED WHAT WAS RIGHT AND IT WAS NOT REPAID TO ME

HE HAS REDEEMED MY SOUL FROM GOING DOWN INTO THE PIT AND MY LIFE SHALL LOOK UPON THE LIGHT

' BEHOLD GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS TWICE THREE TIMES WITH A MAN TO BRING BACK HIS SOUL FROM THE PIT THAT HE MAY BE LIGHTED WITH THE LIGHT OF LIFE

PAY ATTENTION O JOB LISTEN TO ME; BE SILENT AND I WILL SPEAK

IF YOU HAVE ANY WORDS ANSWER ME; SPEAK FOR I DESIRE TO JUSTIFY YOU

IF NOT LISTEN TO ME; BE SILENT AND I WILL TEACH YOU WISDOM

THEN ELIHU ANSWERED AND SAID HEAR MY WORDS YOU WISE MEN AND GIVE EAR TO ME YOU WHO KNOW; FOR THE EAR TESTS WORDS AS THE PALATE TASTES FOOD

LET US CHOOSE WHAT IS RIGHT; LET US KNOW AMONG OURSELVES WHAT IS GOOD

FOR JOB HAS SAID 'I AM IN THE RIGHT AND GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY RIGHT; IN SPITE OF MY RIGHT I AM COUNTED A LIAR; MY WOUND IS INCURABLE THOUGH I AM WITHOUT TRANSGRESSION

' WHAT MAN IS LIKE JOB WHO DRINKS UP SCOFFING LIKE WATER WHO TRAVELS IN COMPANY WITH EVILDOERS AND WALKS WITH WICKED MEN

FOR HE HAS SAID 'IT PROFITS A MAN NOTHING THAT HE SHOULD TAKE DELIGHT IN GOD

' THEREFORE HEAR ME YOU MEN OF UNDERSTANDING FAR BE IT FROM GOD THAT HE SHOULD DO WICKEDNESS AND FROM THE ALMIGHTY THAT HE SHOULD DO WRONG

FOR ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF A MAN HE WILL REPAY HIM AND ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS HE WILL MAKE IT BEFALL HIM

OF A TRUTH GOD WILL NOT DO WICKEDLY AND THE ALMIGHTY WILL NOT PERVERT JUSTICE

WHO GAVE HIM CHARGE OVER THE EARTH AND WHO LAID ON HIM THE WHOLE WORLD

IF HE SHOULD SET HIS HEART TO IT AND GATHER TO HIMSELF HIS SPIRIT AND HIS BREATH ALL FLESH WOULD PERISH TOGETHER AND MAN WOULD RETURN TO DUST

IF YOU HAVE UNDERSTANDING HEAR THIS; LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY

SHALL ONE WHO HATES JUSTICE GOVERN

WILL YOU CONDEMN HIM WHO IS RIGHTEOUS AND MIGHTY WHO SAYS TO A KING 'WORTHLESS ONE' AND TO NOBLES 'WICKED MAN' WHO SHOWS NO PARTIALITY TO PRINCES NOR REGARDS THE RICH MORE THAN THE POOR FOR THEY ARE ALL THE WORK OF HIS HANDS

IN A MOMENT THEY DIE; AT MIDNIGHT THE PEOPLE ARE SHAKEN AND PASS AWAY AND THE MIGHTY ARE TAKEN AWAY BY NO HUMAN HAND

FOR HIS EYES ARE ON THE WAYS OF A MAN AND HE SEES ALL HIS STEPS

THERE IS NO GLOOM OR DEEP DARKNESS WHERE EVILDOERS MAY HIDE THEMSELVES

FOR GOD HAS NO NEED TO CONSIDER A MAN FURTHER THAT HE SHOULD GO BEFORE GOD IN JUDGMENT

HE SHATTERS THE MIGHTY WITHOUT INVESTIGATION AND SETS OTHERS IN THEIR PLACE

THUS KNOWING THEIR WORKS HE OVERTURNS THEM IN THE NIGHT AND THEY ARE CRUSHED

HE STRIKES THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS IN A PLACE FOR ALL TO SEE BECAUSE THEY TURNED ASIDE FROM FOLLOWING HIM AND HAD NO REGARD FOR ANY OF HIS WAYS SO THAT THEY CAUSED THE CRY OF THE POOR TO COME TO HIM AND HE HEARD THE CRY OF THE AFFLICTED WHEN HE IS QUIET WHO CAN CONDEMN

WHEN HE HIDES HIS FACE WHO CAN BEHOLD HIM WHETHER IT BE A NATION OR A MAN

 THAT A GODLESS MAN SHOULD NOT REIGN THAT HE SHOULD NOT ENSNARE THE PEOPLE

FOR HAS ANYONE SAID TO GOD 'I HAVE BORNE PUNISHMENT; I WILL NOT OFFEND ANY MORE; TEACH ME WHAT I DO NOT SEE; IF I HAVE DONE INIQUITY I WILL DO IT NO MORE'

WILL HE THEN MAKE REPAYMENT TO SUIT YOU BECAUSE YOU REJECT IT

FOR YOU MUST CHOOSE AND NOT I; THEREFORE DECLARE WHAT YOU KNOW

MEN OF UNDERSTANDING WILL SAY TO ME AND THE WISE MAN WHO HEARS ME WILL SAY 'JOB SPEAKS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE; HIS WORDS ARE WITHOUT INSIGHT

' WOULD THAT JOB WERE TRIED TO THE END BECAUSE HE ANSWERS LIKE WICKED MEN

FOR HE ADDS REBELLION TO HIS SIN; HE CLAPS HIS HANDS AMONG US AND MULTIPLIES HIS WORDS AGAINST GOD

AND ELIHU ANSWERED AND SAID DO YOU THINK THIS TO BE JUST

DO YOU SAY 'IT IS MY RIGHT BEFORE GOD' THAT YOU ASK 'WHAT ADVANTAGE HAVE I

HOW AM I BETTER OFF THAN IF I HAD SINNED

' I WILL ANSWER YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WITH YOU

LOOK AT THE HEAVENS AND SEE; AND BEHOLD THE CLOUDS WHICH ARE HIGHER THAN YOU

IF YOU HAVE SINNED WHAT DO YOU ACCOMPLISH AGAINST HIM

AND IF YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS ARE MULTIPLIED WHAT DO YOU DO TO HIM

IF YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS WHAT DO YOU GIVE TO HIM

OR WHAT DOES HE RECEIVE FROM YOUR HAND

YOUR WICKEDNESS CONCERNS A MAN LIKE YOURSELF AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS A SON OF MAN

BECAUSE OF THE MULTITUDE OF OPPRESSIONS PEOPLE CRY OUT; THEY CALL FOR HELP BECAUSE OF THE ARM OF THE MIGHTY

BUT NONE SAYS 'WHERE IS GOD MY MAKER WHO GIVES SONGS IN THE NIGHT WHO TEACHES US MORE THAN THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH AND MAKES US WISER THAN THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS

' THERE THEY CRY OUT BUT HE DOES NOT ANSWER BECAUSE OF THE PRIDE OF EVIL MEN

SURELY GOD DOES NOT HEAR AN EMPTY CRY NOR DOES THE ALMIGHTY REGARD IT

HOW MUCH LESS WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU DO NOT SEE HIM THAT THE CASE IS BEFORE HIM AND YOU ARE WAITING FOR HIM

AND NOW BECAUSE HIS ANGER DOES NOT PUNISH AND HE DOES NOT TAKE MUCH NOTE OF TRANSGRESSION JOB OPENS HIS MOUTH IN EMPTY TALK; HE MULTIPLIES WORDS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE

AND ELIHU CONTINUED AND SAID BEAR WITH ME A LITTLE AND I WILL SHOW YOU FOR I HAVE YET SOMETHING TO SAY ON GOD'S BEHALF

I WILL GET MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR AND ASCRIBE RIGHTEOUSNESS TO MY MAKER

FOR TRULY MY WORDS ARE NOT FALSE; ONE WHO IS PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE IS WITH YOU

BEHOLD GOD IS MIGHTY AND DOES NOT DESPISE ANY; HE IS MIGHTY IN STRENGTH OF UNDERSTANDING

HE DOES NOT KEEP THE WICKED ALIVE BUT GIVES THE AFFLICTED THEIR RIGHT

HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS EYES FROM THE RIGHTEOUS BUT WITH KINGS ON THE THRONE HE SETS THEM FOREVER AND THEY ARE EXALTED

AND IF THEY ARE BOUND IN CHAINS AND CAUGHT IN THE CORDS OF AFFLICTION THEN HE DECLARES TO THEM THEIR WORK AND THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS THAT THEY ARE BEHAVING ARROGANTLY

HE OPENS THEIR EARS TO INSTRUCTION AND COMMANDS THAT THEY RETURN FROM INIQUITY

IF THEY LISTEN AND SERVE HIM THEY COMPLETE THEIR DAYS IN PROSPERITY AND THEIR YEARS IN PLEASANTNESS

BUT IF THEY DO NOT LISTEN THEY PERISH BY THE SWORD AND DIE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE

THE GODLESS IN HEART CHERISH ANGER; THEY DO NOT CRY FOR HELP WHEN HE BINDS THEM

THEY DIE IN YOUTH AND THEIR LIFE ENDS AMONG THE CULT PROSTITUTES

HE DELIVERS THE AFFLICTED BY THEIR AFFLICTION AND OPENS THEIR EAR BY ADVERSITY

HE ALSO ALLURED YOU OUT OF DISTRESS INTO A BROAD PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO CRAMPING AND WHAT WAS SET ON YOUR TABLE WAS FULL OF FATNESS

BUT YOU ARE FULL OF THE JUDGMENT ON THE WICKED; JUDGMENT AND JUSTICE SEIZE YOU

BEWARE LEST WRATH ENTICE YOU INTO SCOFFING AND LET NOT THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM TURN YOU ASIDE

WILL YOUR CRY FOR HELP AVAIL TO KEEP YOU FROM DISTRESS OR ALL THE FORCE OF YOUR STRENGTH

DO NOT LONG FOR THE NIGHT WHEN PEOPLES VANISH IN THEIR PLACE

TAKE CARE; DO NOT TURN TO INIQUITY FOR THIS YOU HAVE CHOSEN RATHER THAN AFFLICTION

BEHOLD GOD IS EXALTED IN HIS POWER; WHO IS A TEACHER LIKE HIM

WHO HAS PRESCRIBED FOR HIM HIS WAY OR WHO CAN SAY 'YOU HAVE DONE WRONG'

REMEMBER TO EXTOL HIS WORK OF WHICH MEN HAVE SUNG

ALL MANKIND HAS LOOKED ON IT; MAN BEHOLDS IT FROM AFAR

BEHOLD GOD IS GREAT AND WE KNOW HIM NOT; THE NUMBER OF HIS YEARS IS UNSEARCHABLE

FOR HE DRAWS UP THE DROPS OF WATER; THEY DISTILL HIS MIST IN RAIN WHICH THE SKIES POUR DOWN AND DROP ON MANKIND ABUNDANTLY

CAN ANYONE UNDERSTAND THE SPREADING OF THE CLOUDS THE THUNDERINGS OF HIS PAVILION

BEHOLD HE SCATTERS HIS LIGHTNING ABOUT HIM AND COVERS THE ROOTS OF THE SEA

FOR BY THESE HE JUDGES PEOPLES; HE GIVES FOOD IN ABUNDANCE

HE COVERS HIS HANDS WITH THE LIGHTNING AND COMMANDS IT TO STRIKE THE MARK

ITS CRASHING DECLARES HIS PRESENCE; THE CATTLE ALSO DECLARE THAT HE RISES

AT THIS ALSO MY HEART TREMBLES AND LEAPS OUT OF ITS PLACE

KEEP LISTENING TO THE THUNDER OF HIS VOICE AND THE RUMBLING THAT COMES FROM HIS MOUTH

UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN HE LETS IT GO AND HIS LIGHTNING TO THE CORNERS OF THE EARTH

AFTER IT HIS VOICE ROARS; HE THUNDERS WITH HIS MAJESTIC VOICE AND HE DOES NOT RESTRAIN THE LIGHTNINGS WHEN HIS VOICE IS HEARD

GOD THUNDERS WONDROUSLY WITH HIS VOICE; HE DOES GREAT THINGS THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND

FOR TO THE SNOW HE SAYS 'FALL ON THE EARTH' LIKEWISE TO THE DOWNPOUR HIS MIGHTY DOWNPOUR

HE SEALS UP THE HAND OF EVERY MAN THAT ALL MEN WHOM HE MADE MAY KNOW IT

THEN THE BEASTS GO INTO THEIR LAIRS AND REMAIN IN THEIR DENS

FROM ITS CHAMBER COMES THE WHIRLWIND AND COLD FROM THE SCATTERING WINDS

BY THE BREATH OF GOD ICE IS GIVEN AND THE BROAD WATERS ARE FROZEN FAST

HE LOADS THE THICK CLOUD WITH MOISTURE; THE CLOUDS SCATTER HIS LIGHTNING

THEY TURN AROUND AND AROUND BY HIS GUIDANCE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT HE COMMANDS THEM ON THE FACE OF THE HABITABLE WORLD

WHETHER FOR CORRECTION OR FOR HIS LAND OR FOR LOVE HE CAUSES IT TO HAPPEN

HEAR THIS O JOB; STOP AND CONSIDER THE WONDROUS WORKS OF GOD

DO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LAYS HIS COMMAND UPON THEM AND CAUSES THE LIGHTNING OF HIS CLOUD TO SHINE

DO YOU KNOW THE BALANCINGS OF THE CLOUDS THE WONDROUS WORKS OF HIM WHO IS PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE YOU WHOSE GARMENTS ARE HOT WHEN THE EARTH IS STILL BECAUSE OF THE SOUTH WIND

CAN YOU LIKE HIM SPREAD OUT THE SKIES HARD AS A CAST METAL MIRROR

TEACH US WHAT WE SHALL SAY TO HIM; WE CANNOT DRAW UP OUR CASE BECAUSE OF DARKNESS

SHALL IT BE TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD SPEAK

DID A MAN EVER WISH THAT HE WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP

AND NOW NO ONE LOOKS ON THE LIGHT WHEN IT IS BRIGHT IN THE SKIES WHEN THE WIND HAS PASSED AND CLEARED THEM

OUT OF THE NORTH COMES GOLDEN SPLENDOR; GOD IS CLOTHED WITH AWESOME MAJESTY

THE ALMIGHTYWE CANNOT FIND HIM; HE IS GREAT IN POWER; JUSTICE AND ABUNDANT RIGHTEOUSNESS HE WILL NOT VIOLATE

THEREFORE MEN FEAR HIM; HE DOES NOT REGARD ANY WHO ARE WISE IN THEIR OWN CONCEIT

THEN THE LORD ANSWERED JOB OUT OF THE WHIRLWIND AND SAID WHO IS THIS THAT DARKENS COUNSEL BY WORDS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE

DRESS FOR ACTION LIKE A MAN; I WILL QUESTION YOU AND YOU MAKE IT KNOWN TO ME

WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH

TELL ME IF YOU HAVE UNDERSTANDING

WHO DETERMINED ITS MEASUREMENTSSURELY YOU KNOW

OR WHO STRETCHED THE LINE UPON IT

ON WHAT WERE ITS BASES SUNK OR WHO LAID ITS CORNERSTONE WHEN THE MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND ALL THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOY

OR WHO SHUT IN THE SEA WITH DOORS WHEN IT BURST OUT FROM THE WOMB WHEN I MADE CLOUDS ITS GARMENT AND THICK DARKNESS ITS SWADDLING BAND AND PRESCRIBED LIMITS FOR IT AND SET BARS AND DOORS AND SAID 'THUS FAR SHALL YOU COME AND NO FARTHER AND HERE SHALL YOUR PROUD WAVES BE STAYED'

HAVE YOU COMMANDED THE MORNING SINCE YOUR DAYS BEGAN AND CAUSED THE DAWN TO KNOW ITS PLACE THAT IT MIGHT TAKE HOLD OF THE SKIRTS OF THE EARTH AND THE WICKED BE SHAKEN OUT OF IT

IT IS CHANGED LIKE CLAY UNDER THE SEAL AND ITS FEATURES STAND OUT LIKE A GARMENT

FROM THE WICKED THEIR LIGHT IS WITHHELD AND THEIR UPLIFTED ARM IS BROKEN

HAVE YOU ENTERED INTO THE SPRINGS OF THE SEA OR WALKED IN THE RECESSES OF THE DEEP

HAVE THE GATES OF DEATH BEEN REVEALED TO YOU OR HAVE YOU SEEN THE GATES OF DEEP DARKNESS

HAVE YOU COMPREHENDED THE EXPANSE OF THE EARTH

DECLARE IF YOU KNOW ALL THIS

WHERE IS THE WAY TO THE DWELLING OF LIGHT AND WHERE IS THE PLACE OF DARKNESS THAT YOU MAY TAKE IT TO ITS TERRITORY AND THAT YOU MAY DISCERN THE PATHS TO ITS HOME

YOU KNOW FOR YOU WERE BORN THEN AND THE NUMBER OF YOUR DAYS IS GREAT

HAVE YOU ENTERED THE STOREHOUSES OF THE SNOW OR HAVE YOU SEEN THE STOREHOUSES OF THE HAIL WHICH I HAVE RESERVED FOR THE TIME OF TROUBLE FOR THE DAY OF BATTLE AND WAR

WHAT IS THE WAY TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LIGHT IS DISTRIBUTED OR WHERE THE EAST WIND IS SCATTERED UPON THE EARTH

WHO HAS CLEFT A CHANNEL FOR THE TORRENTS OF RAIN AND A WAY FOR THE THUNDERBOLT TO BRING RAIN ON A LAND WHERE NO MAN IS ON THE DESERT IN WHICH THERE IS NO MAN TO SATISFY THE WASTE AND DESOLATE LAND AND TO MAKE THE GROUND SPROUT WITH GRASS

HAS THE RAIN A FATHER OR WHO HAS BEGOTTEN THE DROPS OF DEW

FROM WHOSE WOMB DID THE ICE COME FORTH AND WHO HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO THE FROST OF HEAVEN

THE WATERS BECOME HARD LIKE STONE AND THE FACE OF THE DEEP IS FROZEN

CAN YOU BIND THE CHAINS OF THE PLEIADES OR LOOSE THE CORDS OF ORION

CAN YOU LEAD FORTH THE MAZZAROTH IN THEIR SEASON OR CAN YOU GUIDE THE BEAR WITH ITS CHILDREN

DO YOU KNOW THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEAVENS

CAN YOU ESTABLISH THEIR RULE ON THE EARTH

CAN YOU LIFT UP YOUR VOICE TO THE CLOUDS THAT A FLOOD OF WATERS MAY COVER YOU

CAN YOU SEND FORTH LIGHTNINGS THAT THEY MAY GO AND SAY TO YOU 'HERE WE ARE'

WHO HAS PUT WISDOM IN THE INWARD PARTS OR GIVEN UNDERSTANDING TO THE MIND

WHO CAN NUMBER THE CLOUDS BY WISDOM

OR WHO CAN TILT THE WATERSKINS OF THE HEAVENS WHEN THE DUST RUNS INTO A MASS AND THE CLODS STICK FAST TOGETHER

CAN YOU HUNT THE PREY FOR THE LION OR SATISFY THE APPETITE OF THE YOUNG LIONS WHEN THEY CROUCH IN THEIR DENS OR LIE IN WAIT IN THEIR THICKET

WHO PROVIDES FOR THE RAVEN ITS PREY WHEN ITS YOUNG ONES CRY TO GOD FOR HELP AND WANDER ABOUT FOR LACK OF FOOD

DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE MOUNTAIN GOATS GIVE BIRTH

DO YOU OBSERVE THE CALVING OF THE DOES

CAN YOU NUMBER THE MONTHS THAT THEY FULFILL AND DO YOU KNOW THE TIME WHEN THEY GIVE BIRTH WHEN THEY CROUCH BRING FORTH THEIR OFFSPRING AND ARE DELIVERED OF THEIR YOUNG

THEIR YOUNG ONES BECOME STRONG; THEY GROW UP IN THE OPEN; THEY GO OUT AND DO NOT RETURN TO THEM

WHO HAS LET THE WILD DONKEY GO FREE

WHO HAS LOOSED THE BONDS OF THE SWIFT DONKEY TO WHOM I HAVE GIVEN THE ARID PLAIN FOR HIS HOME AND THE SALT LAND FOR HIS DWELLING PLACE

HE SCORNS THE TUMULT OF THE CITY; HE HEARS NOT THE SHOUTS OF THE DRIVER

HE RANGES THE MOUNTAINS AS HIS PASTURE AND HE SEARCHES AFTER EVERY GREEN THING

IS THE WILD OX WILLING TO SERVE YOU

WILL HE SPEND THE NIGHT AT YOUR MANGER

CAN YOU BIND HIM IN THE FURROW WITH ROPES OR WILL HE HARROW THE VALLEYS AFTER YOU

WILL YOU DEPEND ON HIM BECAUSE HIS STRENGTH IS GREAT AND WILL YOU LEAVE TO HIM YOUR LABOR

DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN HIM THAT HE WILL RETURN YOUR GRAIN AND GATHER IT TO YOUR THRESHING FLOOR

THE WINGS OF THE OSTRICH WAVE PROUDLY BUT ARE THEY THE PINIONS AND PLUMAGE OF LOVE

FOR SHE LEAVES HER EGGS TO THE EARTH AND LETS THEM BE WARMED ON THE GROUND FORGETTING THAT A FOOT MAY CRUSH THEM AND THAT THE WILD BEAST MAY TRAMPLE THEM

SHE DEALS CRUELLY WITH HER YOUNG AS IF THEY WERE NOT HERS; THOUGH HER LABOR BE IN VAIN YET SHE HAS NO FEAR BECAUSE GOD HAS MADE HER FORGET WISDOM AND GIVEN HER NO SHARE IN UNDERSTANDING

WHEN SHE ROUSES HERSELF TO FLEE SHE LAUGHS AT THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER

DO YOU GIVE THE HORSE HIS MIGHT

DO YOU CLOTHE HIS NECK WITH A MANE

DO YOU MAKE HIM LEAP LIKE THE LOCUST

HIS MAJESTIC SNORTING IS TERRIFYING

HE PAWS IN THE VALLEY AND EXULTS IN HIS STRENGTH; HE GOES OUT TO MEET THE WEAPONS

HE LAUGHS AT FEAR AND IS NOT DISMAYED; HE DOES NOT TURN BACK FROM THE SWORD

UPON HIM RATTLE THE QUIVER THE FLASHING SPEAR AND THE JAVELIN

WITH FIERCENESS AND RAGE HE SWALLOWS THE GROUND; HE CANNOT STAND STILL AT THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET

WHEN THE TRUMPET SOUNDS HE SAYS 'AHA

' HE SMELLS THE BATTLE FROM AFAR THE THUNDER OF THE CAPTAINS AND THE SHOUTING

IS IT BY YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE HAWK SOARS AND SPREADS HIS WINGS TOWARD THE SOUTH

IS IT AT YOUR COMMAND THAT THE EAGLE MOUNTS UP AND MAKES HIS NEST ON HIGH

ON THE ROCK HE DWELLS AND MAKES HIS HOME ON THE ROCKY CRAG AND STRONGHOLD

FROM THERE HE SPIES OUT THE PREY; HIS EYES BEHOLD IT AFAR OFF

HIS YOUNG ONES SUCK UP BLOOD AND WHERE THE SLAIN ARE THERE IS HE

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOB SHALL A FAULTFINDER CONTEND WITH THE ALMIGHTY

HE WHO ARGUES WITH GOD LET HIM ANSWER IT

 THEN JOB ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID BEHOLD I AM OF SMALL ACCOUNT; WHAT SHALL I ANSWER YOU

I LAY MY HAND ON MY MOUTH

I HAVE SPOKEN ONCE AND I WILL NOT ANSWER; TWICE BUT I WILL PROCEED NO FURTHER

 THEN THE LORD ANSWERED JOB OUT OF THE WHIRLWIND AND SAID DRESS FOR ACTION LIKE A MAN; I WILL QUESTION YOU AND YOU MAKE IT KNOWN TO ME

WILL YOU EVEN PUT ME IN THE WRONG

WILL YOU CONDEMN ME THAT YOU MAY BE IN THE RIGHT

HAVE YOU AN ARM LIKE GOD AND CAN YOU THUNDER WITH A VOICE LIKE HIS

ADORN YOURSELF WITH MAJESTY AND DIGNITY; CLOTHE YOURSELF WITH GLORY AND SPLENDOR

POUR OUT THE OVERFLOWINGS OF YOUR ANGER AND LOOK ON EVERYONE WHO IS PROUD AND ABASE HIM

LOOK ON EVERYONE WHO IS PROUD AND BRING HIM LOW AND TREAD DOWN THE WICKED WHERE THEY STAND

HIDE THEM ALL IN THE DUST TOGETHER; BIND THEIR FACES IN THE WORLD BELOW

THEN WILL I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOU THAT YOUR OWN RIGHT HAND CAN SAVE YOU

BEHOLD BEHEMOTH WHICH I MADE AS I MADE YOU; HE EATS GRASS LIKE AN OX

BEHOLD HIS STRENGTH IN HIS LOINS AND HIS POWER IN THE MUSCLES OF HIS BELLY

HE MAKES HIS TAIL STIFF LIKE A CEDAR; THE SINEWS OF HIS THIGHS ARE KNIT TOGETHER

HIS BONES ARE TUBES OF BRONZE HIS LIMBS LIKE BARS OF IRON

HE IS THE FIRST OF THE WORKS OF GOD; LET HIM WHO MADE HIM BRING NEAR HIS SWORD

FOR THE MOUNTAINS YIELD FOOD FOR HIM WHERE ALL THE WILD BEASTS PLAY

UNDER THE LOTUS PLANTS HE LIES IN THE SHELTER OF THE REEDS AND IN THE MARSH

FOR HIS SHADE THE LOTUS TREES COVER HIM; THE WILLOWS OF THE BROOK SURROUND HIM

BEHOLD IF THE RIVER IS TURBULENT HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED; HE IS CONFIDENT THOUGH JORDAN RUSHES AGAINST HIS MOUTH

CAN ONE TAKE HIM BY HIS EYES OR PIERCE HIS NOSE WITH A SNARE

CAN YOU DRAW OUT LEVIATHAN WITH A FISHHOOK OR PRESS DOWN HIS TONGUE WITH A CORD

CAN YOU PUT A ROPE IN HIS NOSE OR PIERCE HIS JAW WITH A HOOK

WILL HE MAKE MANY PLEAS TO YOU

WILL HE SPEAK TO YOU SOFT WORDS

WILL HE MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU TO TAKE HIM FOR YOUR SERVANT FOREVER

WILL YOU PLAY WITH HIM AS WITH A BIRD OR WILL YOU PUT HIM ON A LEASH FOR YOUR GIRLS

WILL TRADERS BARGAIN OVER HIM

WILL THEY DIVIDE HIM UP AMONG THE MERCHANTS

CAN YOU FILL HIS SKIN WITH HARPOONS OR HIS HEAD WITH FISHING SPEARS

LAY YOUR HANDS ON HIM; REMEMBER THE BATTLEYOU WILL NOT DO IT AGAIN

BEHOLD THE HOPE OF A MAN IS FALSE; HE IS LAID LOW EVEN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM

NO ONE IS SO FIERCE THAT HE DARES TO STIR HIM UP

WHO THEN IS HE WHO CAN STAND BEFORE ME

WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO ME THAT I SHOULD REPAY HIM

WHATEVER IS UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN IS MINE

I WILL NOT KEEP SILENCE CONCERNING HIS LIMBS OR HIS MIGHTY STRENGTH OR HIS GOODLY FRAME

WHO CAN STRIP OFF HIS OUTER GARMENT

WHO WOULD COME NEAR HIM WITH A BRIDLE

WHO CAN OPEN THE DOORS OF HIS FACE

AROUND HIS TEETH IS TERROR

HIS BACK IS MADE OF ROWS OF SHIELDS SHUT UP CLOSELY AS WITH A SEAL

ONE IS SO NEAR TO ANOTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM

THEY ARE JOINED ONE TO ANOTHER; THEY CLASP EACH OTHER AND CANNOT BE SEPARATED

HIS SNEEZINGS FLASH FORTH LIGHT AND HIS EYES ARE LIKE THE EYELIDS OF THE DAWN

OUT OF HIS MOUTH GO FLAMING TORCHES; SPARKS OF FIRE LEAP FORTH

OUT OF HIS NOSTRILS COMES FORTH SMOKE AS FROM A BOILING POT AND BURNING RUSHES

HIS BREATH KINDLES COALS AND A FLAME COMES FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH

IN HIS NECK ABIDES STRENGTH AND TERROR DANCES BEFORE HIM

THE FOLDS OF HIS FLESH STICK TOGETHER FIRMLY CAST ON HIM AND IMMOVABLE

HIS HEART IS HARD AS A STONE HARD AS THE LOWER MILLSTONE

WHEN HE RAISES HIMSELF UP THE MIGHTY ARE AFRAID; AT THE CRASHING THEY ARE BESIDE THEMSELVES

THOUGH THE SWORD REACHES HIM IT DOES NOT AVAIL NOR THE SPEAR THE DART OR THE JAVELIN

HE COUNTS IRON AS STRAW AND BRONZE AS ROTTEN WOOD

THE ARROW CANNOT MAKE HIM FLEE; FOR HIM SLING STONES ARE TURNED TO STUBBLE

CLUBS ARE COUNTED AS STUBBLE; HE LAUGHS AT THE RATTLE OF JAVELINS

HIS UNDERPARTS ARE LIKE SHARP POTSHERDS; HE SPREADS HIMSELF LIKE A THRESHING SLEDGE ON THE MIRE

HE MAKES THE DEEP BOIL LIKE A POT; HE MAKES THE SEA LIKE A POT OF OINTMENT

BEHIND HIM HE LEAVES A SHINING WAKE; ONE WOULD THINK THE DEEP TO BE WHITEHAIRED

ON EARTH THERE IS NOT HIS LIKE A CREATURE WITHOUT FEAR

HE SEES EVERYTHING THAT IS HIGH; HE IS KING OVER ALL THE SONS OF PRIDE

THEN JOB ANSWERED THE LORD AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO ALL THINGS AND THAT NO PURPOSE OF YOURS CAN BE THWARTED

'WHO IS THIS THAT HIDES COUNSEL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE

' THEREFORE I HAVE UTTERED WHAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS TOO WONDERFUL FOR ME WHICH I DID NOT KNOW

'HEAR AND I WILL SPEAK; I WILL QUESTION YOU AND YOU MAKE IT KNOWN TO ME

' I HAD HEARD OF YOU BY THE HEARING OF THE EAR BUT NOW MY EYE SEES YOU; THEREFORE I DESPISE MYSELF AND REPENT IN DUST AND ASHES

 AFTER THE LORD HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS TO JOB THE LORD SAID TO ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE MY ANGER BURNS AGAINST YOU AND AGAINST YOUR TWO FRIENDS FOR YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF ME WHAT IS RIGHT AS MY SERVANT JOB HAS

NOW THEREFORE TAKE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS AND GO TO MY SERVANT JOB AND OFFER UP A BURNT OFFERING FOR YOURSELVES

AND MY SERVANT JOB SHALL PRAY FOR YOU FOR I WILL ACCEPT HIS PRAYER NOT TO DEAL WITH YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR FOLLY

FOR YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF ME WHAT IS RIGHT AS MY SERVANT JOB HAS

 SO ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE AND BILDAD THE SHUHITE AND ZOPHAR THE NAAMATHITE WENT AND DID WHAT THE LORD HAD TOLD THEM AND THE LORD ACCEPTED JOB'S PRAYER

AND THE LORD RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF JOB WHEN HE HAD PRAYED FOR HIS FRIENDS

AND THE LORD GAVE JOB TWICE AS MUCH AS HE HAD BEFORE

THEN CAME TO HIM ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL WHO HAD KNOWN HIM BEFORE AND ATE BREAD WITH HIM IN HIS HOUSE

AND THEY SHOWED HIM SYMPATHY AND COMFORTED HIM FOR ALL THE EVIL THAT THE LORD HAD BROUGHT UPON HIM

AND EACH OF THEM GAVE HIM A PIECE OF MONEY AND A RING OF GOLD

AND THE LORD BLESSED THE LATTER DAYS OF JOB MORE THAN HIS BEGINNING

AND HE HAD  SHEEP  CAMELS  YOKE OF OXEN AND  FEMALE DONKEYS

HE HAD ALSO SEVEN SONS AND THREE DAUGHTERS

AND HE CALLED THE NAME OF THE FIRST DAUGHTER JEMIMAH AND THE NAME OF THE SECOND KEZIAH AND THE NAME OF THE THIRD KERENHAPPUCH

AND IN ALL THE LAND THERE WERE NO WOMEN SO BEAUTIFUL AS JOB'S DAUGHTERS

AND THEIR FATHER GAVE THEM AN INHERITANCE AMONG THEIR BROTHERS

AND AFTER THIS JOB LIVED  YEARS AND SAW HIS SONS AND HIS SONS' SONS FOUR GENERATIONS

AND JOB DIED AN OLD MAN AND FULL OF DAYS

TITUSPAUL A SERVANT OF GOD AND AN APOSTLE OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAITH OF GOD'S ELECT AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH WHICH ACCORDS WITH GODLINESS IN HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE WHICH GOD WHO NEVER LIES PROMISED BEFORE THE AGES BEGAN AND AT THE PROPER TIME MANIFESTED IN HIS WORD THROUGH THE PREACHING WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED BY THE COMMAND OF GOD OUR SAVIOR; TO TITUS MY TRUE CHILD IN A COMMON FAITHGRACE AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND CHRIST JESUS OUR SAVIOR

THIS IS WHY I LEFT YOU IN CRETE SO THAT YOU MIGHT PUT WHAT REMAINED INTO ORDER AND APPOINT ELDERS IN EVERY TOWN AS I DIRECTED YOU IF ANYONE IS ABOVE REPROACH THE HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN ARE BELIEVERS AND NOT OPEN TO THE CHARGE OF DEBAUCHERY OR INSUBORDINATION

FOR AN OVERSEER AS GOD'S STEWARD MUST BE ABOVE REPROACH

HE MUST NOT BE ARROGANT OR QUICKTEMPERED OR A DRUNKARD OR VIOLENT OR GREEDY FOR GAIN BUT HOSPITABLE A LOVER OF GOOD SELFCONTROLLED UPRIGHT HOLY AND DISCIPLINED

HE MUST HOLD FIRM TO THE TRUSTWORTHY WORD AS TAUGHT SO THAT HE MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE INSTRUCTION IN SOUND DOCTRINE AND ALSO TO REBUKE THOSE WHO CONTRADICT IT

FOR THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE INSUBORDINATE EMPTY TALKERS AND DECEIVERS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE CIRCUMCISION PARTY

THEY MUST BE SILENCED SINCE THEY ARE UPSETTING WHOLE FAMILIES BY TEACHING FOR SHAMEFUL GAIN WHAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO TEACH

ONE OF THE CRETANS A PROPHET OF THEIR OWN SAID CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS EVIL BEASTS LAZY GLUTTONS

 THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE

THEREFORE REBUKE THEM SHARPLY THAT THEY MAY BE SOUND IN THE FAITH NOT DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO JEWISH MYTHS AND THE COMMANDS OF PEOPLE WHO TURN AWAY FROM THE TRUTH

TO THE PURE ALL THINGS ARE PURE BUT TO THE DEFILED AND UNBELIEVING NOTHING IS PURE; BUT BOTH THEIR MINDS AND THEIR CONSCIENCES ARE DEFILED

THEY PROFESS TO KNOW GOD BUT THEY DENY HIM BY THEIR WORKS

THEY ARE DETESTABLE DISOBEDIENT UNFIT FOR ANY GOOD WORK

BUT AS FOR YOU TEACH WHAT ACCORDS WITH SOUND DOCTRINE

OLDER MEN ARE TO BE SOBERMINDED DIGNIFIED SELFCONTROLLED SOUND IN FAITH IN LOVE AND IN STEADFASTNESS

OLDER WOMEN LIKEWISE ARE TO BE REVERENT IN BEHAVIOR NOT SLANDERERS OR SLAVES TO MUCH WINE

THEY ARE TO TEACH WHAT IS GOOD AND SO TRAIN THE YOUNG WOMEN TO LOVE THEIR HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN TO BE SELFCONTROLLED PURE WORKING AT HOME KIND AND SUBMISSIVE TO THEIR OWN HUSBANDS THAT THE WORD OF GOD MAY NOT BE REVILED

LIKEWISE URGE THE YOUNGER MEN TO BE SELFCONTROLLED

SHOW YOURSELF IN ALL RESPECTS TO BE A MODEL OF GOOD WORKS AND IN YOUR TEACHING SHOW INTEGRITY DIGNITY AND SOUND SPEECH THAT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED SO THAT AN OPPONENT MAY BE PUT TO SHAME HAVING NOTHING EVIL TO SAY ABOUT US

SLAVES ARE TO BE SUBMISSIVE TO THEIR OWN MASTERS IN EVERYTHING; THEY ARE TO BE WELLPLEASING NOT ARGUMENTATIVE NOT PILFERING BUT SHOWING ALL GOOD FAITH SO THAT IN EVERYTHING THEY MAY ADORN THE DOCTRINE OF GOD OUR SAVIOR

FOR THE GRACE OF GOD HAS APPEARED BRINGING SALVATION FOR ALL PEOPLE TRAINING US TO RENOUNCE UNGODLINESS AND WORLDLY PASSIONS AND TO LIVE SELFCONTROLLED UPRIGHT AND GODLY LIVES IN THE PRESENT AGE WAITING FOR OUR BLESSED HOPE THE APPEARING OF THE GLORY OF OUR GREAT GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR US TO REDEEM US FROM ALL LAWLESSNESS AND TO PURIFY FOR HIMSELF A PEOPLE FOR HIS OWN POSSESSION WHO ARE ZEALOUS FOR GOOD WORKS

DECLARE THESE THINGS; EXHORT AND REBUKE WITH ALL AUTHORITY

LET NO ONE DISREGARD YOU

REMIND THEM TO BE SUBMISSIVE TO RULERS AND AUTHORITIES TO BE OBEDIENT TO BE READY FOR EVERY GOOD WORK TO SPEAK EVIL OF NO ONE TO AVOID QUARRELING TO BE GENTLE AND TO SHOW PERFECT COURTESY TOWARD ALL PEOPLE

FOR WE OURSELVES WERE ONCE FOOLISH DISOBEDIENT LED ASTRAY SLAVES TO VARIOUS PASSIONS AND PLEASURES PASSING OUR DAYS IN MALICE AND ENVY HATED BY OTHERS AND HATING ONE ANOTHER

BUT WHEN THE GOODNESS AND LOVING KINDNESS OF GOD OUR SAVIOR APPEARED HE SAVED US NOT BECAUSE OF WORKS DONE BY US IN RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN MERCY BY THE WASHING OF REGENERATION AND RENEWAL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WHOM HE POURED OUT ON US RICHLY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR SO THAT BEING JUSTIFIED BY HIS GRACE WE MIGHT BECOME HEIRS ACCORDING TO THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE

THE SAYING IS TRUSTWORTHY AND I WANT YOU TO INSIST ON THESE THINGS SO THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVED IN GOD MAY BE CAREFUL TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO GOOD WORKS

THESE THINGS ARE EXCELLENT AND PROFITABLE FOR PEOPLE

BUT AVOID FOOLISH CONTROVERSIES GENEALOGIES DISSENSIONS AND QUARRELS ABOUT THE LAW FOR THEY ARE UNPROFITABLE AND WORTHLESS

AS FOR A PERSON WHO STIRS UP DIVISION AFTER WARNING HIM ONCE AND THEN TWICE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HIM KNOWING THAT SUCH A PERSON IS WARPED AND SINFUL; HE IS SELFCONDEMNED

WHEN I SEND ARTEMAS OR TYCHICUS TO YOU DO YOUR BEST TO COME TO ME AT NICOPOLIS FOR I HAVE DECIDED TO SPEND THE WINTER THERE

DO YOUR BEST TO SPEED ZENAS THE LAWYER AND APOLLOS ON THEIR WAY; SEE THAT THEY LACK NOTHING

AND LET OUR PEOPLE LEARN TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO GOOD WORKS SO AS TO HELP CASES OF URGENT NEED AND NOT BE UNFRUITFUL

ALL WHO ARE WITH ME SEND GREETINGS TO YOU

GREET THOSE WHO LOVE US IN THE FAITH

GRACE BE WITH YOU ALL

 TIMOTHYPAUL AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS BY THE WILL OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF THE LIFE THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS TO TIMOTHY MY BELOVED CHILDGRACE MERCY AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD

I THANK GOD WHOM I SERVE AS DID MY ANCESTORS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AS I REMEMBER YOU CONSTANTLY IN MY PRAYERS NIGHT AND DAY

AS I REMEMBER YOUR TEARS I LONG TO SEE YOU THAT I MAY BE FILLED WITH JOY

I AM REMINDED OF YOUR SINCERE FAITH A FAITH THAT DWELT FIRST IN YOUR GRANDMOTHER LOIS AND YOUR MOTHER EUNICE AND NOW I AM SURE DWELLS IN YOU AS WELL

FOR THIS REASON I REMIND YOU TO FAN INTO FLAME THE GIFT OF GOD WHICH IS IN YOU THROUGH THE LAYING ON OF MY HANDS FOR GOD GAVE US A SPIRIT NOT OF FEAR BUT OF POWER AND LOVE AND SELFCONTROL

THEREFORE DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF THE TESTIMONY ABOUT OUR LORD NOR OF ME HIS PRISONER BUT SHARE IN SUFFERING FOR THE GOSPEL BY THE POWER OF GOD WHO SAVED US AND CALLED US TO A HOLY CALLING NOT BECAUSE OF OUR WORKS BUT BECAUSE OF HIS OWN PURPOSE AND GRACE WHICH HE GAVE US IN CHRIST JESUS BEFORE THE AGES BEGAN AND WHICH NOW HAS BEEN MANIFESTED THROUGH THE APPEARING OF OUR SAVIOR CHRIST JESUS WHO ABOLISHED DEATH AND BROUGHT LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT THROUGH THE GOSPEL FOR WHICH I WAS APPOINTED A PREACHER AND APOSTLE AND TEACHER WHICH IS WHY I SUFFER AS I DO

BUT I AM NOT ASHAMED FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED AND I AM CONVINCED THAT HE IS ABLE TO GUARD UNTIL THAT DAY WHAT HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME

FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF THE SOUND WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME IN THE FAITH AND LOVE THAT ARE IN CHRIST JESUS

BY THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO DWELLS WITHIN US GUARD THE GOOD DEPOSIT ENTRUSTED TO YOU

YOU ARE AWARE THAT ALL WHO ARE IN ASIA TURNED AWAY FROM ME AMONG WHOM ARE PHYGELUS AND HERMOGENES

MAY THE LORD GRANT MERCY TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF ONESIPHORUS FOR HE OFTEN REFRESHED ME AND WAS NOT ASHAMED OF MY CHAINS BUT WHEN HE ARRIVED IN ROME HE SEARCHED FOR ME EARNESTLY AND FOUND ME MAY THE LORD GRANT HIM TO FIND MERCY FROM THE LORD ON THAT DAY

AND YOU WELL KNOW ALL THE SERVICE HE RENDERED AT EPHESUS

YOU THEN MY CHILD BE STRENGTHENED BY THE GRACE THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS AND WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY WITNESSES ENTRUST TO FAITHFUL MEN WHO WILL BE ABLE TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO

SHARE IN SUFFERING AS A GOOD SOLDIER OF CHRIST JESUS

NO SOLDIER GETS ENTANGLED IN CIVILIAN PURSUITS SINCE HIS AIM IS TO PLEASE THE ONE WHO ENLISTED HIM

AN ATHLETE IS NOT CROWNED UNLESS HE COMPETES ACCORDING TO THE RULES

IT IS THE HARDWORKING FARMER WHO OUGHT TO HAVE THE FIRST SHARE OF THE CROPS

THINK OVER WHAT I SAY FOR THE LORD WILL GIVE YOU UNDERSTANDING IN EVERYTHING

REMEMBER JESUS CHRIST RISEN FROM THE DEAD THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID AS PREACHED IN MY GOSPEL FOR WHICH I AM SUFFERING BOUND WITH CHAINS AS A CRIMINAL

BUT THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT BOUND

THEREFORE I ENDURE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE ELECT THAT THEY ALSO MAY OBTAIN THE SALVATION THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS WITH ETERNAL GLORY

THE SAYING IS TRUSTWORTHY FOR IF WE HAVE DIED WITH HIM WE WILL ALSO LIVE WITH HIM; IF WE ENDURE WE WILL ALSO REIGN WITH HIM; IF WE DENY HIM HE ALSO WILL DENY US; IF WE ARE FAITHLESS HE REMAINS FAITHFULFOR HE CANNOT DENY HIMSELF

REMIND THEM OF THESE THINGS AND CHARGE THEM BEFORE GOD NOT TO QUARREL ABOUT WORDS WHICH DOES NO GOOD BUT ONLY RUINS THE HEARERS

DO YOUR BEST TO PRESENT YOURSELF TO GOD AS ONE APPROVED A WORKER WHO HAS NO NEED TO BE ASHAMED RIGHTLY HANDLING THE WORD OF TRUTH

BUT AVOID IRREVERENT BABBLE FOR IT WILL LEAD PEOPLE INTO MORE AND MORE UNGODLINESS AND THEIR TALK WILL SPREAD LIKE GANGRENE

AMONG THEM ARE HYMENAEUS AND PHILETUS WHO HAVE SWERVED FROM THE TRUTH SAYING THAT THE RESURRECTION HAS ALREADY HAPPENED

THEY ARE UPSETTING THE FAITH OF SOME

BUT GOD'S FIRM FOUNDATION STANDS BEARING THIS SEAL THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS AND LET EVERYONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD DEPART FROM INIQUITY

 NOW IN A GREAT HOUSE THERE ARE NOT ONLY VESSELS OF GOLD AND SILVER BUT ALSO OF WOOD AND CLAY SOME FOR HONORABLE USE SOME FOR DISHONORABLE

THEREFORE IF ANYONE CLEANSES HIMSELF FROM WHAT IS DISHONORABLE HE WILL BE A VESSEL FOR HONORABLE USE SET APART AS HOLY USEFUL TO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE READY FOR EVERY GOOD WORK

SO FLEE YOUTHFUL PASSIONS AND PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS FAITH LOVE AND PEACE ALONG WITH THOSE WHO CALL ON THE LORD FROM A PURE HEART

HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH FOOLISH IGNORANT CONTROVERSIES; YOU KNOW THAT THEY BREED QUARRELS

AND THE LORD'S SERVANT MUST NOT BE QUARRELSOME BUT KIND TO EVERYONE ABLE TO TEACH PATIENTLY ENDURING EVIL CORRECTING HIS OPPONENTS WITH GENTLENESS

GOD MAY PERHAPS GRANT THEM REPENTANCE LEADING TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH AND THEY MAY ESCAPE FROM THE SNARE OF THE DEVIL AFTER BEING CAPTURED BY HIM TO DO HIS WILL

BUT UNDERSTAND THIS THAT IN THE LAST DAYS THERE WILL COME TIMES OF DIFFICULTY

FOR PEOPLE WILL BE LOVERS OF SELF LOVERS OF MONEY PROUD ARROGANT ABUSIVE DISOBEDIENT TO THEIR PARENTS UNGRATEFUL UNHOLY HEARTLESS UNAPPEASABLE SLANDEROUS WITHOUT SELFCONTROL BRUTAL NOT LOVING GOOD TREACHEROUS RECKLESS SWOLLEN WITH CONCEIT LOVERS OF PLEASURE RATHER THAN LOVERS OF GOD HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF GODLINESS BUT DENYING ITS POWER

AVOID SUCH PEOPLE

FOR AMONG THEM ARE THOSE WHO CREEP INTO HOUSEHOLDS AND CAPTURE WEAK WOMEN BURDENED WITH SINS AND LED ASTRAY BY VARIOUS PASSIONS ALWAYS LEARNING AND NEVER ABLE TO ARRIVE AT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH

JUST AS JANNES AND JAMBRES OPPOSED MOSES SO THESE MEN ALSO OPPOSE THE TRUTH MEN CORRUPTED IN MIND AND DISQUALIFIED REGARDING THE FAITH

BUT THEY WILL NOT GET VERY FAR FOR THEIR FOLLY WILL BE PLAIN TO ALL AS WAS THAT OF THOSE TWO MEN

YOU HOWEVER HAVE FOLLOWED MY TEACHING MY CONDUCT MY AIM IN LIFE MY FAITH MY PATIENCE MY LOVE MY STEADFASTNESS MY PERSECUTIONS AND SUFFERINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME AT ANTIOCH AT ICONIUM AND AT LYSTRAWHICH PERSECUTIONS I ENDURED; YET FROM THEM ALL THE LORD RESCUED ME

INDEED ALL WHO DESIRE TO LIVE A GODLY LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS WILL BE PERSECUTED WHILE EVIL PEOPLE AND IMPOSTORS WILL GO ON FROM BAD TO WORSE DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED

BUT AS FOR YOU CONTINUE IN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED AND HAVE FIRMLY BELIEVED KNOWING FROM WHOM YOU LEARNED IT AND HOW FROM CHILDHOOD YOU HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE SACRED WRITINGS WHICH ARE ABLE TO MAKE YOU WISE FOR SALVATION THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS

ALL SCRIPTURE IS BREATHED OUT BY GOD AND PROFITABLE FOR TEACHING FOR REPROOF FOR CORRECTION AND FOR TRAINING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT THE MAN OF GOD MAY BE COMPETENT EQUIPPED FOR EVERY GOOD WORK

I CHARGE YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND OF CHRIST JESUS WHO IS TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND BY HIS APPEARING AND HIS KINGDOM PREACH THE WORD; BE READY IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON; REPROVE REBUKE AND EXHORT WITH COMPLETE PATIENCE AND TEACHING

FOR THE TIME IS COMING WHEN PEOPLE WILL NOT ENDURE SOUND TEACHING BUT HAVING ITCHING EARS THEY WILL ACCUMULATE FOR THEMSELVES TEACHERS TO SUIT THEIR OWN PASSIONS AND WILL TURN AWAY FROM LISTENING TO THE TRUTH AND WANDER OFF INTO MYTHS

AS FOR YOU ALWAYS BE SOBERMINDED ENDURE SUFFERING DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST FULFILL YOUR MINISTRY

FOR I AM ALREADY BEING POURED OUT AS A DRINK OFFERING AND THE TIME OF MY DEPARTURE HAS COME

I HAVE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT I HAVE FINISHED THE RACE I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH

HENCEFORTH THERE IS LAID UP FOR ME THE CROWN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH THE LORD THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGE WILL AWARD TO ME ON THAT DAY AND NOT ONLY TO ME BUT ALSO TO ALL WHO HAVE LOVED HIS APPEARING

DO YOUR BEST TO COME TO ME SOON

FOR DEMAS IN LOVE WITH THIS PRESENT WORLD HAS DESERTED ME AND GONE TO THESSALONICA

CRESCENS HAS GONE TO GALATIA TITUS TO DALMATIA

LUKE ALONE IS WITH ME

GET MARK AND BRING HIM WITH YOU FOR HE IS VERY USEFUL TO ME FOR MINISTRY

TYCHICUS I HAVE SENT TO EPHESUS

WHEN YOU COME BRING THE CLOAK THAT I LEFT WITH CARPUS AT TROAS ALSO THE BOOKS AND ABOVE ALL THE PARCHMENTS

ALEXANDER THE COPPERSMITH DID ME GREAT HARM; THE LORD WILL REPAY HIM ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS

BEWARE OF HIM YOURSELF FOR HE STRONGLY OPPOSED OUR MESSAGE

AT MY FIRST DEFENSE NO ONE CAME TO STAND BY ME BUT ALL DESERTED ME

MAY IT NOT BE CHARGED AGAINST THEM

BUT THE LORD STOOD BY ME AND STRENGTHENED ME SO THAT THROUGH ME THE MESSAGE MIGHT BE FULLY PROCLAIMED AND ALL THE GENTILES MIGHT HEAR IT

SO I WAS RESCUED FROM THE LION'S MOUTH

THE LORD WILL RESCUE ME FROM EVERY EVIL DEED AND BRING ME SAFELY INTO HIS HEAVENLY KINGDOM

TO HIM BE THE GLORY FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

GREET PRISCA AND AQUILA AND THE HOUSEHOLD OF ONESIPHORUS

ERASTUS REMAINED AT CORINTH AND I LEFT TROPHIMUS WHO WAS ILL AT MILETUS

DO YOUR BEST TO COME BEFORE WINTER

EUBULUS SENDS GREETINGS TO YOU AS DO PUDENS AND LINUS AND CLAUDIA AND ALL THE BROTHERS

THE LORD BE WITH YOUR SPIRIT

GRACE BE WITH YOU

JAMESJAMES A SERVANT OF GOD AND OF THE LORD JESUS CHRISTTO THE TWELVE TRIBES IN THE DISPERSIONGREETINGS

COUNT IT ALL JOY MY BROTHERS WHEN YOU MEET TRIALS OF VARIOUS KINDS FOR YOU KNOW THAT THE TESTING OF YOUR FAITH PRODUCES STEADFASTNESS

AND LET STEADFASTNESS HAVE ITS FULL EFFECT THAT YOU MAY BE PERFECT AND COMPLETE LACKING IN NOTHING

IF ANY OF YOU LACKS WISDOM LET HIM ASK GOD WHO GIVES GENEROUSLY TO ALL WITHOUT REPROACH AND IT WILL BE GIVEN HIM

BUT LET HIM ASK IN FAITH WITH NO DOUBTING FOR THE ONE WHO DOUBTS IS LIKE A WAVE OF THE SEA THAT IS DRIVEN AND TOSSED BY THE WIND

FOR THAT PERSON MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT HE WILL RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM THE LORD; HE IS A DOUBLEMINDED MAN UNSTABLE IN ALL HIS WAYS

LET THE LOWLY BROTHER BOAST IN HIS EXALTATION AND THE RICH IN HIS HUMILIATION BECAUSE LIKE A FLOWER OF THE GRASS HE WILL PASS AWAY

FOR THE SUN RISES WITH ITS SCORCHING HEAT AND WITHERS THE GRASS; ITS FLOWER FALLS AND ITS BEAUTY PERISHES

SO ALSO WILL THE RICH MAN FADE AWAY IN THE MIDST OF HIS PURSUITS

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO REMAINS STEADFAST UNDER TRIAL FOR WHEN HE HAS STOOD THE TEST HE WILL RECEIVE THE CROWN OF LIFE WHICH GOD HAS PROMISED TO THOSE WHO LOVE HIM

LET NO ONE SAY WHEN HE IS TEMPTED I AM BEING TEMPTED BY GOD FOR GOD CANNOT BE TEMPTED WITH EVIL AND HE HIMSELF TEMPTS NO ONE

BUT EACH PERSON IS TEMPTED WHEN HE IS LURED AND ENTICED BY HIS OWN DESIRE

THEN DESIRE WHEN IT HAS CONCEIVED GIVES BIRTH TO SIN AND SIN WHEN IT IS FULLY GROWN BRINGS FORTH DEATH

DO NOT BE DECEIVED MY BELOVED BROTHERS

EVERY GOOD GIFT AND EVERY PERFECT GIFT IS FROM ABOVE COMING DOWN FROM THE FATHER OF LIGHTS WITH WHOM THERE IS NO VARIATION OR SHADOW DUE TO CHANGE

OF HIS OWN WILL HE BROUGHT US FORTH BY THE WORD OF TRUTH THAT WE SHOULD BE A KIND OF FIRSTFRUITS OF HIS CREATURES

KNOW THIS MY BELOVED BROTHERS LET EVERY PERSON BE QUICK TO HEAR SLOW TO SPEAK SLOW TO ANGER; FOR THE ANGER OF MAN DOES NOT PRODUCE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT GOD REQUIRES

THEREFORE PUT AWAY ALL FILTHINESS AND RAMPANT WICKEDNESS AND RECEIVE WITH MEEKNESS THE IMPLANTED WORD WHICH IS ABLE TO SAVE YOUR SOULS

BUT BE DOERS OF THE WORD AND NOT HEARERS ONLY DECEIVING YOURSELVES

FOR IF ANYONE IS A HEARER OF THE WORD AND NOT A DOER HE IS LIKE A MAN WHO LOOKS INTENTLY AT HIS NATURAL FACE IN A MIRROR

FOR HE LOOKS AT HIMSELF AND GOES AWAY AND AT ONCE FORGETS WHAT HE WAS LIKE

BUT THE ONE WHO LOOKS INTO THE PERFECT LAW THE LAW OF LIBERTY AND PERSEVERES BEING NO HEARER WHO FORGETS BUT A DOER WHO ACTS HE WILL BE BLESSED IN HIS DOING

IF ANYONE THINKS HE IS RELIGIOUS AND DOES NOT BRIDLE HIS TONGUE BUT DECEIVES HIS HEART THIS PERSON'S RELIGION IS WORTHLESS

RELIGION THAT IS PURE AND UNDEFILED BEFORE GOD THE FATHER IS THIS TO VISIT ORPHANS AND WIDOWS IN THEIR AFFLICTION AND TO KEEP ONESELF UNSTAINED FROM THE WORLD

MY BROTHERS SHOW NO PARTIALITY AS YOU HOLD THE FAITH IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THE LORD OF GLORY

FOR IF A MAN WEARING A GOLD RING AND FINE CLOTHING COMES INTO YOUR ASSEMBLY AND A POOR MAN IN SHABBY CLOTHING ALSO COMES IN AND IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE ONE WHO WEARS THE FINE CLOTHING AND SAY YOU SIT HERE IN A GOOD PLACE WHILE YOU SAY TO THE POOR MAN YOU STAND OVER THERE OR SIT DOWN AT MY FEET HAVE YOU NOT THEN MADE DISTINCTIONS AMONG YOURSELVES AND BECOME JUDGES WITH EVIL THOUGHTS

LISTEN MY BELOVED BROTHERS HAS NOT GOD CHOSEN THOSE WHO ARE POOR IN THE WORLD TO BE RICH IN FAITH AND HEIRS OF THE KINGDOM WHICH HE HAS PROMISED TO THOSE WHO LOVE HIM

BUT YOU HAVE DISHONORED THE POOR MAN

ARE NOT THE RICH THE ONES WHO OPPRESS YOU AND THE ONES WHO DRAG YOU INTO COURT

ARE THEY NOT THE ONES WHO BLASPHEME THE HONORABLE NAME BY WHICH YOU WERE CALLED

IF YOU REALLY FULFILL THE ROYAL LAW ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURE YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF YOU ARE DOING WELL

BUT IF YOU SHOW PARTIALITY YOU ARE COMMITTING SIN AND ARE CONVICTED BY THE LAW AS TRANSGRESSORS

FOR WHOEVER KEEPS THE WHOLE LAW BUT FAILS IN ONE POINT HAS BECOME ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL OF IT

FOR HE WHO SAID DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY ALSO SAID DO NOT MURDER

 IF YOU DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY BUT DO MURDER YOU HAVE BECOME A TRANSGRESSOR OF THE LAW

SO SPEAK AND SO ACT AS THOSE WHO ARE TO BE JUDGED UNDER THE LAW OF LIBERTY

FOR JUDGMENT IS WITHOUT MERCY TO ONE WHO HAS SHOWN NO MERCY

MERCY TRIUMPHS OVER JUDGMENT

WHAT GOOD IS IT MY BROTHERS IF SOMEONE SAYS HE HAS FAITH BUT DOES NOT HAVE WORKS

CAN THAT FAITH SAVE HIM

IF A BROTHER OR SISTER IS POORLY CLOTHED AND LACKING IN DAILY FOOD AND ONE OF YOU SAYS TO THEM GO IN PEACE BE WARMED AND FILLED WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE THINGS NEEDED FOR THE BODY WHAT GOOD IS THAT

SO ALSO FAITH BY ITSELF IF IT DOES NOT HAVE WORKS IS DEAD

BUT SOMEONE WILL SAY YOU HAVE FAITH AND I HAVE WORKS

 SHOW ME YOUR FAITH APART FROM YOUR WORKS AND I WILL SHOW YOU MY FAITH BY MY WORKS

YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD IS ONE; YOU DO WELL

EVEN THE DEMONS BELIEVEAND SHUDDER

DO YOU WANT TO BE SHOWN YOU FOOLISH PERSON THAT FAITH APART FROM WORKS IS USELESS

WAS NOT ABRAHAM OUR FATHER JUSTIFIED BY WORKS WHEN HE OFFERED UP HIS SON ISAAC ON THE ALTAR

YOU SEE THAT FAITH WAS ACTIVE ALONG WITH HIS WORKS AND FAITH WAS COMPLETED BY HIS WORKS; AND THE SCRIPTURE WAS FULFILLED THAT SAYS ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESSAND HE WAS CALLED A FRIEND OF GOD

YOU SEE THAT A PERSON IS JUSTIFIED BY WORKS AND NOT BY FAITH ALONE

AND IN THE SAME WAY WAS NOT ALSO RAHAB THE PROSTITUTE JUSTIFIED BY WORKS WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE MESSENGERS AND SENT THEM OUT BY ANOTHER WAY

FOR AS THE BODY APART FROM THE SPIRIT IS DEAD SO ALSO FAITH APART FROM WORKS IS DEAD

NOT MANY OF YOU SHOULD BECOME TEACHERS MY BROTHERS FOR YOU KNOW THAT WE WHO TEACH WILL BE JUDGED WITH GREATER STRICTNESS

FOR WE ALL STUMBLE IN MANY WAYS AND IF ANYONE DOES NOT STUMBLE IN WHAT HE SAYS HE IS A PERFECT MAN ABLE ALSO TO BRIDLE HIS WHOLE BODY

IF WE PUT BITS INTO THE MOUTHS OF HORSES SO THAT THEY OBEY US WE GUIDE THEIR WHOLE BODIES AS WELL

LOOK AT THE SHIPS ALSO THOUGH THEY ARE SO LARGE AND ARE DRIVEN BY STRONG WINDS THEY ARE GUIDED BY A VERY SMALL RUDDER WHEREVER THE WILL OF THE PILOT DIRECTS

SO ALSO THE TONGUE IS A SMALL MEMBER YET IT BOASTS OF GREAT THINGS

HOW GREAT A FOREST IS SET ABLAZE BY SUCH A SMALL FIRE

AND THE TONGUE IS A FIRE A WORLD OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS

THE TONGUE IS SET AMONG OUR MEMBERS STAINING THE WHOLE BODY SETTING ON FIRE THE ENTIRE COURSE OF LIFE AND SET ON FIRE BY HELL

FOR EVERY KIND OF BEAST AND BIRD OF REPTILE AND SEA CREATURE CAN BE TAMED AND HAS BEEN TAMED BY MANKIND BUT NO HUMAN BEING CAN TAME THE TONGUE

IT IS A RESTLESS EVIL FULL OF DEADLY POISON

WITH IT WE BLESS OUR LORD AND FATHER AND WITH IT WE CURSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MADE IN THE LIKENESS OF GOD

FROM THE SAME MOUTH COME BLESSING AND CURSING

MY BROTHERS THESE THINGS OUGHT NOT TO BE SO

DOES A SPRING POUR FORTH FROM THE SAME OPENING BOTH FRESH AND SALT WATER

CAN A FIG TREE MY BROTHERS BEAR OLIVES OR A GRAPEVINE PRODUCE FIGS

NEITHER CAN A SALT POND YIELD FRESH WATER

WHO IS WISE AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG YOU

BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT LET HIM SHOW HIS WORKS IN THE MEEKNESS OF WISDOM

BUT IF YOU HAVE BITTER JEALOUSY AND SELFISH AMBITION IN YOUR HEARTS DO NOT BOAST AND BE FALSE TO THE TRUTH

THIS IS NOT THE WISDOM THAT COMES DOWN FROM ABOVE BUT IS EARTHLY UNSPIRITUAL DEMONIC

FOR WHERE JEALOUSY AND SELFISH AMBITION EXIST THERE WILL BE DISORDER AND EVERY VILE PRACTICE

BUT THE WISDOM FROM ABOVE IS FIRST PURE THEN PEACEABLE GENTLE OPEN TO REASON FULL OF MERCY AND GOOD FRUITS IMPARTIAL AND SINCERE

AND A HARVEST OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS SOWN IN PEACE BY THOSE WHO MAKE PEACE

WHAT CAUSES QUARRELS AND WHAT CAUSES FIGHTS AMONG YOU

IS IT NOT THIS THAT YOUR PASSIONS ARE AT WAR WITHIN YOU

YOU DESIRE AND DO NOT HAVE SO YOU MURDER

YOU COVET AND CANNOT OBTAIN SO YOU FIGHT AND QUARREL

YOU DO NOT HAVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT ASK

YOU ASK AND DO NOT RECEIVE BECAUSE YOU ASK WRONGLY TO SPEND IT ON YOUR PASSIONS

YOU ADULTEROUS PEOPLE

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE WORLD IS ENMITY WITH GOD

THEREFORE WHOEVER WISHES TO BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD MAKES HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF GOD

OR DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS TO NO PURPOSE THAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE YEARNS JEALOUSLY OVER THE SPIRIT THAT HE HAS MADE TO DWELL IN US

BUT HE GIVES MORE GRACE

THEREFORE IT SAYS GOD OPPOSES THE PROUD BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE

 SUBMIT YOURSELVES THEREFORE TO GOD

RESIST THE DEVIL AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU

DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND HE WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU

CLEANSE YOUR HANDS YOU SINNERS AND PURIFY YOUR HEARTS YOU DOUBLEMINDED

BE WRETCHED AND MOURN AND WEEP

LET YOUR LAUGHTER BE TURNED TO MOURNING AND YOUR JOY TO GLOOM

HUMBLE YOURSELVES BEFORE THE LORD AND HE WILL EXALT YOU

DO NOT SPEAK EVIL AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BROTHERS

THE ONE WHO SPEAKS AGAINST A BROTHER OR JUDGES HIS BROTHER SPEAKS EVIL AGAINST THE LAW AND JUDGES THE LAW

BUT IF YOU JUDGE THE LAW YOU ARE NOT A DOER OF THE LAW BUT A JUDGE

THERE IS ONLY ONE LAWGIVER AND JUDGE HE WHO IS ABLE TO SAVE AND TO DESTROY

BUT WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE YOUR NEIGHBOR

COME NOW YOU WHO SAY TODAY OR TOMORROW WE WILL GO INTO SUCH AND SUCH A TOWN AND SPEND A YEAR THERE AND TRADE AND MAKE A PROFIT YET YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING

WHAT IS YOUR LIFE

FOR YOU ARE A MIST THAT APPEARS FOR A LITTLE TIME AND THEN VANISHES

INSTEAD YOU OUGHT TO SAY IF THE LORD WILLS WE WILL LIVE AND DO THIS OR THAT

 AS IT IS YOU BOAST IN YOUR ARROGANCE

ALL SUCH BOASTING IS EVIL

SO WHOEVER KNOWS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND FAILS TO DO IT FOR HIM IT IS SIN

COME NOW YOU RICH WEEP AND HOWL FOR THE MISERIES THAT ARE COMING UPON YOU

YOUR RICHES HAVE ROTTED AND YOUR GARMENTS ARE MOTHEATEN

YOUR GOLD AND SILVER HAVE CORRODED AND THEIR CORROSION WILL BE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU AND WILL EAT YOUR FLESH LIKE FIRE

YOU HAVE LAID UP TREASURE IN THE LAST DAYS

BEHOLD THE WAGES OF THE LABORERS WHO MOWED YOUR FIELDS WHICH YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD ARE CRYING OUT AGAINST YOU AND THE CRIES OF THE HARVESTERS HAVE REACHED THE EARS OF THE LORD OF HOSTS

YOU HAVE LIVED ON THE EARTH IN LUXURY AND IN SELFINDULGENCE

YOU HAVE FATTENED YOUR HEARTS IN A DAY OF SLAUGHTER

YOU HAVE CONDEMNED; YOU HAVE MURDERED THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON

HE DOES NOT RESIST YOU

BE PATIENT THEREFORE BROTHERS UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD

SEE HOW THE FARMER WAITS FOR THE PRECIOUS FRUIT OF THE EARTH BEING PATIENT ABOUT IT UNTIL IT RECEIVES THE EARLY AND THE LATE RAINS

YOU ALSO BE PATIENT

ESTABLISH YOUR HEARTS FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD IS AT HAND

DO NOT GRUMBLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BROTHERS SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BE JUDGED; BEHOLD THE JUDGE IS STANDING AT THE DOOR

AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUFFERING AND PATIENCE BROTHERS TAKE THE PROPHETS WHO SPOKE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

BEHOLD WE CONSIDER THOSE BLESSED WHO REMAINED STEADFAST

YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE STEADFASTNESS OF JOB AND YOU HAVE SEEN THE PURPOSE OF THE LORD HOW THE LORD IS COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL

BUT ABOVE ALL MY BROTHERS DO NOT SWEAR EITHER BY HEAVEN OR BY EARTH OR BY ANY OTHER OATH BUT LET YOUR YES BE YES AND YOUR NO BE NO SO THAT YOU MAY NOT FALL UNDER CONDEMNATION

IS ANYONE AMONG YOU SUFFERING

LET HIM PRAY

IS ANYONE CHEERFUL

LET HIM SING PRAISE

IS ANYONE AMONG YOU SICK

LET HIM CALL FOR THE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH AND LET THEM PRAY OVER HIM ANOINTING HIM WITH OIL IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND THE PRAYER OF FAITH WILL SAVE THE ONE WHO IS SICK AND THE LORD WILL RAISE HIM UP

AND IF HE HAS COMMITTED SINS HE WILL BE FORGIVEN

THEREFORE CONFESS YOUR SINS TO ONE ANOTHER AND PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER THAT YOU MAY BE HEALED

THE PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS PERSON HAS GREAT POWER AS IT IS WORKING

ELIJAH WAS A MAN WITH A NATURE LIKE OURS AND HE PRAYED FERVENTLY THAT IT MIGHT NOT RAIN AND FOR THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS IT DID NOT RAIN ON THE EARTH

THEN HE PRAYED AGAIN AND HEAVEN GAVE RAIN AND THE EARTH BORE ITS FRUIT

MY BROTHERS IF ANYONE AMONG YOU WANDERS FROM THE TRUTH AND SOMEONE BRINGS HIM BACK LET HIM KNOW THAT WHOEVER BRINGS BACK A SINNER FROM HIS WANDERING WILL SAVE HIS SOUL FROM DEATH AND WILL COVER A MULTITUDE OF SINS

 JOHNTHE ELDER TO THE ELECT LADY AND HER CHILDREN WHOM I LOVE IN TRUTH AND NOT ONLY I BUT ALSO ALL WHO KNOW THE TRUTH BECAUSE OF THE TRUTH THAT ABIDES IN US AND WILL BE WITH US FOREVER GRACE MERCY AND PEACE WILL BE WITH US FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM JESUS CHRIST THE FATHER'S SON IN TRUTH AND LOVE

I REJOICED GREATLY TO FIND SOME OF YOUR CHILDREN WALKING IN THE TRUTH JUST AS WE WERE COMMANDED BY THE FATHER

AND NOW I ASK YOU DEAR LADYNOT AS THOUGH I WERE WRITING YOU A NEW COMMANDMENT BUT THE ONE WE HAVE HAD FROM THE BEGINNINGTHAT WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER

AND THIS IS LOVE THAT WE WALK ACCORDING TO HIS COMMANDMENTS; THIS IS THE COMMANDMENT JUST AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE BEGINNING SO THAT YOU SHOULD WALK IN IT

FOR MANY DECEIVERS HAVE GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD THOSE WHO DO NOT CONFESS THE COMING OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE FLESH

SUCH A ONE IS THE DECEIVER AND THE ANTICHRIST

WATCH YOURSELVES SO THAT YOU MAY NOT LOSE WHAT WE HAVE WORKED FOR BUT MAY WIN A FULL REWARD

EVERYONE WHO GOES ON AHEAD AND DOES NOT ABIDE IN THE TEACHING OF CHRIST DOES NOT HAVE GOD

WHOEVER ABIDES IN THE TEACHING HAS BOTH THE FATHER AND THE SON

IF ANYONE COMES TO YOU AND DOES NOT BRING THIS TEACHING DO NOT RECEIVE HIM INTO YOUR HOUSE OR GIVE HIM ANY GREETING FOR WHOEVER GREETS HIM TAKES PART IN HIS WICKED WORKS

THOUGH I HAVE MUCH TO WRITE TO YOU I WOULD RATHER NOT USE PAPER AND INK

INSTEAD I HOPE TO COME TO YOU AND TALK FACE TO FACE SO THAT OUR JOY MAY BE COMPLETE

THE CHILDREN OF YOUR ELECT SISTER GREET YOU

ISAIAHTHE VISION OF ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ WHICH HE SAW CONCERNING JUDAH AND JERUSALEM IN THE DAYS OF UZZIAH JOTHAM AHAZ AND HEZEKIAH KINGS OF JUDAH

HEAR O HEAVENS AND GIVE EAR O EARTH; FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN CHILDREN HAVE I REARED AND BROUGHT UP BUT THEY HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

THE OX KNOWS ITS OWNER AND THE DONKEY ITS MASTER'S CRIB BUT ISRAEL DOES NOT KNOW MY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND

 AH SINFUL NATION A PEOPLE LADEN WITH INIQUITY OFFSPRING OF EVILDOERS CHILDREN WHO DEAL CORRUPTLY

THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD THEY HAVE DESPISED THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL THEY ARE UTTERLY ESTRANGED

WHY WILL YOU STILL BE STRUCK DOWN

WHY WILL YOU CONTINUE TO REBEL

THE WHOLE HEAD IS SICK AND THE WHOLE HEART FAINT

FROM THE SOLE OF THE FOOT EVEN TO THE HEAD THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS IN IT BUT BRUISES AND SORES AND RAW WOUNDS; THEY ARE NOT PRESSED OUT OR BOUND UP OR SOFTENED WITH OIL

YOUR COUNTRY LIES DESOLATE; YOUR CITIES ARE BURNED WITH FIRE; IN YOUR VERY PRESENCE FOREIGNERS DEVOUR YOUR LAND; IT IS DESOLATE AS OVERTHROWN BY FOREIGNERS

AND THE DAUGHTER OF ZION IS LEFT LIKE A BOOTH IN A VINEYARD LIKE A LODGE IN A CUCUMBER FIELD LIKE A BESIEGED CITY

IF THE LORD OF HOSTS HAD NOT LEFT US A FEW SURVIVORS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE SODOM AND BECOME LIKE GOMORRAH

HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD YOU RULERS OF SODOM

GIVE EAR TO THE TEACHING OF OUR GOD YOU PEOPLE OF GOMORRAH

WHAT TO ME IS THE MULTITUDE OF YOUR SACRIFICES

SAYS THE LORD; I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF BURNT OFFERINGS OF RAMS AND THE FAT OF WELLFED BEASTS; I DO NOT DELIGHT IN THE BLOOD OF BULLS OR OF LAMBS OR OF GOATS

WHEN YOU COME TO APPEAR BEFORE ME WHO HAS REQUIRED OF YOU THIS TRAMPLING OF MY COURTS

BRING NO MORE VAIN OFFERINGS; INCENSE IS AN ABOMINATION TO ME

NEW MOON AND SABBATH AND THE CALLING OF CONVOCATIONSI CANNOT ENDURE INIQUITY AND SOLEMN ASSEMBLY

YOUR NEW MOONS AND YOUR APPOINTED FEASTS MY SOUL HATES; THEY HAVE BECOME A BURDEN TO ME; I AM WEARY OF BEARING THEM

WHEN YOU SPREAD OUT YOUR HANDS I WILL HIDE MY EYES FROM YOU; EVEN THOUGH YOU MAKE MANY PRAYERS I WILL NOT LISTEN; YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD

WASH YOURSELVES; MAKE YOURSELVES CLEAN; REMOVE THE EVIL OF YOUR DEEDS FROM BEFORE MY EYES; CEASE TO DO EVIL LEARN TO DO GOOD; SEEK JUSTICE CORRECT OPPRESSION; BRING JUSTICE TO THE FATHERLESS PLEAD THE WIDOW'S CAUSE

COME NOW LET US REASON TOGETHER SAYS THE LORD THOUGH YOUR SINS ARE LIKE SCARLET THEY SHALL BE AS WHITE AS SNOW; THOUGH THEY ARE RED LIKE CRIMSON THEY SHALL BECOME LIKE WOOL

IF YOU ARE WILLING AND OBEDIENT YOU SHALL EAT THE GOOD OF THE LAND; BUT IF YOU REFUSE AND REBEL YOU SHALL BE EATEN BY THE SWORD; FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

 HOW THE FAITHFUL CITY HAS BECOME A WHORE SHE WHO WAS FULL OF JUSTICE

RIGHTEOUSNESS LODGED IN HER BUT NOW MURDERERS

YOUR SILVER HAS BECOME DROSS YOUR BEST WINE MIXED WITH WATER

YOUR PRINCES ARE REBELS AND COMPANIONS OF THIEVES

EVERYONE LOVES A BRIBE AND RUNS AFTER GIFTS

THEY DO NOT BRING JUSTICE TO THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW'S CAUSE DOES NOT COME TO THEM

THEREFORE THE LORD DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS THE MIGHTY ONE OF ISRAEL AH I WILL GET RELIEF FROM MY ENEMIES AND AVENGE MYSELF ON MY FOES

I WILL TURN MY HAND AGAINST YOU AND WILL SMELT AWAY YOUR DROSS AS WITH LYE AND REMOVE ALL YOUR ALLOY

AND I WILL RESTORE YOUR JUDGES AS AT THE FIRST AND YOUR COUNSELORS AS AT THE BEGINNING

AFTERWARD YOU SHALL BE CALLED THE CITY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THE FAITHFUL CITY

 ZION SHALL BE REDEEMED BY JUSTICE AND THOSE IN HER WHO REPENT BY RIGHTEOUSNESS

BUT REBELS AND SINNERS SHALL BE BROKEN TOGETHER AND THOSE WHO FORSAKE THE LORD SHALL BE CONSUMED

FOR THEY SHALL BE ASHAMED OF THE OAKS THAT YOU DESIRED; AND YOU SHALL BLUSH FOR THE GARDENS THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN

FOR YOU SHALL BE LIKE AN OAK WHOSE LEAF WITHERS AND LIKE A GARDEN WITHOUT WATER

AND THE STRONG SHALL BECOME TINDER AND HIS WORK A SPARK AND BOTH OF THEM SHALL BURN TOGETHER WITH NONE TO QUENCH THEM

THE WORD THAT ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ SAW CONCERNING JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE LATTER DAYS THAT THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND SHALL BE LIFTED UP ABOVE THE HILLS; AND ALL THE NATIONS SHALL FLOW TO IT AND MANY PEOPLES SHALL COME AND SAY COME LET US GO UP TO THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD TO THE HOUSE OF THE GOD OF JACOB THAT HE MAY TEACH US HIS WAYS AND THAT WE MAY WALK IN HIS PATHS

 FOR OUT OF ZION SHALL GO THE LAW AND THE WORD OF THE LORD FROM JERUSALEM

HE SHALL JUDGE BETWEEN THE NATIONS AND SHALL DECIDE DISPUTES FOR MANY PEOPLES; AND THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND THEIR SPEARS INTO PRUNING HOOKS; NATION SHALL NOT LIFT UP SWORD AGAINST NATION NEITHER SHALL THEY LEARN WAR ANYMORE

O HOUSE OF JACOB COME LET US WALK IN THE LIGHT OF THE LORD

FOR YOU HAVE REJECTED YOUR PEOPLE THE HOUSE OF JACOB BECAUSE THEY ARE FULL OF THINGS FROM THE EAST AND OF FORTUNETELLERS LIKE THE PHILISTINES AND THEY STRIKE HANDS WITH THE CHILDREN OF FOREIGNERS

THEIR LAND IS FILLED WITH SILVER AND GOLD AND THERE IS NO END TO THEIR TREASURES; THEIR LAND IS FILLED WITH HORSES AND THERE IS NO END TO THEIR CHARIOTS

THEIR LAND IS FILLED WITH IDOLS; THEY BOW DOWN TO THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS TO WHAT THEIR OWN FINGERS HAVE MADE

SO MAN IS HUMBLED AND EACH ONE IS BROUGHT LOWDO NOT FORGIVE THEM

ENTER INTO THE ROCK AND HIDE IN THE DUST FROM BEFORE THE TERROR OF THE LORD AND FROM THE SPLENDOR OF HIS MAJESTY

THE HAUGHTY LOOKS OF MAN SHALL BE BROUGHT LOW AND THE LOFTY PRIDE OF MEN SHALL BE HUMBLED AND THE LORD ALONE WILL BE EXALTED IN THAT DAY

FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS A DAY AGAINST ALL THAT IS PROUD AND LOFTY AGAINST ALL THAT IS LIFTED UPAND IT SHALL BE BROUGHT LOW; AGAINST ALL THE CEDARS OF LEBANON LOFTY AND LIFTED UP; AND AGAINST ALL THE OAKS OF BASHAN; AGAINST ALL THE LOFTY MOUNTAINS AND AGAINST ALL THE UPLIFTED HILLS; AGAINST EVERY HIGH TOWER AND AGAINST EVERY FORTIFIED WALL; AGAINST ALL THE SHIPS OF TARSHISH AND AGAINST ALL THE BEAUTIFUL CRAFT

AND THE HAUGHTINESS OF MAN SHALL BE HUMBLED AND THE LOFTY PRIDE OF MEN SHALL BE BROUGHT LOW AND THE LORD ALONE WILL BE EXALTED IN THAT DAY

AND THE IDOLS SHALL UTTERLY PASS AWAY

AND PEOPLE SHALL ENTER THE CAVES OF THE ROCKS AND THE HOLES OF THE GROUND FROM BEFORE THE TERROR OF THE LORD AND FROM THE SPLENDOR OF HIS MAJESTY WHEN HE RISES TO TERRIFY THE EARTH

IN THAT DAY MANKIND WILL CAST AWAY THEIR IDOLS OF SILVER AND THEIR IDOLS OF GOLD WHICH THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES TO WORSHIP TO THE MOLES AND TO THE BATS TO ENTER THE CAVERNS OF THE ROCKS AND THE CLEFTS OF THE CLIFFS FROM BEFORE THE TERROR OF THE LORD AND FROM THE SPLENDOR OF HIS MAJESTY WHEN HE RISES TO TERRIFY THE EARTH

STOP REGARDING MAN IN WHOSE NOSTRILS IS BREATH FOR OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS HE

FOR BEHOLD THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS IS TAKING AWAY FROM JERUSALEM AND FROM JUDAH SUPPORT AND SUPPLY ALL SUPPORT OF BREAD AND ALL SUPPORT OF WATER; THE MIGHTY MAN AND THE SOLDIER THE JUDGE AND THE PROPHET THE DIVINER AND THE ELDER THE CAPTAIN OF FIFTY AND THE MAN OF RANK THE COUNSELOR AND THE SKILLFUL MAGICIAN AND THE EXPERT IN CHARMS

AND I WILL MAKE BOYS THEIR PRINCES AND INFANTS SHALL RULE OVER THEM

AND THE PEOPLE WILL OPPRESS ONE ANOTHER EVERY ONE HIS FELLOW AND EVERY ONE HIS NEIGHBOR; THE YOUTH WILL BE INSOLENT TO THE ELDER AND THE DESPISED TO THE HONORABLE

FOR A MAN WILL TAKE HOLD OF HIS BROTHER IN THE HOUSE OF HIS FATHER SAYING YOU HAVE A CLOAK; YOU SHALL BE OUR LEADER AND THIS HEAP OF RUINS SHALL BE UNDER YOUR RULE; IN THAT DAY HE WILL SPEAK OUT SAYING I WILL NOT BE A HEALER; IN MY HOUSE THERE IS NEITHER BREAD NOR CLOAK; YOU SHALL NOT MAKE ME LEADER OF THE PEOPLE

 FOR JERUSALEM HAS STUMBLED AND JUDAH HAS FALLEN BECAUSE THEIR SPEECH AND THEIR DEEDS ARE AGAINST THE LORD DEFYING HIS GLORIOUS PRESENCE

FOR THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES BEARS WITNESS AGAINST THEM; THEY PROCLAIM THEIR SIN LIKE SODOM; THEY DO NOT HIDE IT

WOE TO THEM

FOR THEY HAVE BROUGHT EVIL ON THEMSELVES

TELL THE RIGHTEOUS THAT IT SHALL BE WELL WITH THEM FOR THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR DEEDS

WOE TO THE WICKED

IT SHALL BE ILL WITH HIM FOR WHAT HIS HANDS HAVE DEALT OUT SHALL BE DONE TO HIM

MY PEOPLEINFANTS ARE THEIR OPPRESSORS AND WOMEN RULE OVER THEM

O MY PEOPLE YOUR GUIDES MISLEAD YOU AND THEY HAVE SWALLOWED UP THE COURSE OF YOUR PATHS

THE LORD HAS TAKEN HIS PLACE TO CONTEND; HE STANDS TO JUDGE PEOPLES

THE LORD WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH THE ELDERS AND PRINCES OF HIS PEOPLE IT IS YOU WHO HAVE DEVOURED THE VINEYARD THE SPOIL OF THE POOR IS IN YOUR HOUSES

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CRUSHING MY PEOPLE BY GRINDING THE FACE OF THE POOR

 DECLARES THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS

THE LORD SAID BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION ARE HAUGHTY AND WALK WITH OUTSTRETCHED NECKS GLANCING WANTONLY WITH THEIR EYES MINCING ALONG AS THEY GO TINKLING WITH THEIR FEET THEREFORE THE LORD WILL STRIKE WITH A SCAB THE HEADS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION AND THE LORD WILL LAY BARE THEIR SECRET PARTS

IN THAT DAY THE LORD WILL TAKE AWAY THE FINERY OF THE ANKLETS THE HEADBANDS AND THE CRESCENTS; THE PENDANTS THE BRACELETS AND THE SCARVES; THE HEADDRESSES THE ARMLETS THE SASHES THE PERFUME BOXES AND THE AMULETS; THE SIGNET RINGS AND NOSE RINGS; THE FESTAL ROBES THE MANTLES THE CLOAKS AND THE HANDBAGS; THE MIRRORS THE LINEN GARMENTS THE TURBANS AND THE VEILS

INSTEAD OF PERFUME THERE WILL BE ROTTENNESS; AND INSTEAD OF A BELT A ROPE; AND INSTEAD OF WELLSET HAIR BALDNESS; AND INSTEAD OF A RICH ROBE A SKIRT OF SACKCLOTH; AND BRANDING INSTEAD OF BEAUTY

YOUR MEN SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD AND YOUR MIGHTY MEN IN BATTLE

AND HER GATES SHALL LAMENT AND MOURN; EMPTY SHE SHALL SIT ON THE GROUND

AND SEVEN WOMEN SHALL TAKE HOLD OF ONE MAN IN THAT DAY SAYING WE WILL EAT OUR OWN BREAD AND WEAR OUR OWN CLOTHES ONLY LET US BE CALLED BY YOUR NAME; TAKE AWAY OUR REPROACH

 IN THAT DAY THE BRANCH OF THE LORD SHALL BE BEAUTIFUL AND GLORIOUS AND THE FRUIT OF THE LAND SHALL BE THE PRIDE AND HONOR OF THE SURVIVORS OF ISRAEL

AND HE WHO IS LEFT IN ZION AND REMAINS IN JERUSALEM WILL BE CALLED HOLY EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR LIFE IN JERUSALEM WHEN THE LORD SHALL HAVE WASHED AWAY THE FILTH OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION AND CLEANSED THE BLOODSTAINS OF JERUSALEM FROM ITS MIDST BY A SPIRIT OF JUDGMENT AND BY A SPIRIT OF BURNING

THEN THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE WHOLE SITE OF MOUNT ZION AND OVER HER ASSEMBLIES A CLOUD BY DAY AND SMOKE AND THE SHINING OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT; FOR OVER ALL THE GLORY THERE WILL BE A CANOPY

THERE WILL BE A BOOTH FOR SHADE BY DAY FROM THE HEAT AND FOR A REFUGE AND A SHELTER FROM THE STORM AND RAIN

LET ME SING FOR MY BELOVED MY LOVE SONG CONCERNING HIS VINEYARD MY BELOVED HAD A VINEYARD ON A VERY FERTILE HILL

HE DUG IT AND CLEARED IT OF STONES AND PLANTED IT WITH CHOICE VINES; HE BUILT A WATCHTOWER IN THE MIDST OF IT AND HEWED OUT A WINE VAT IN IT; AND HE LOOKED FOR IT TO YIELD GRAPES BUT IT YIELDED WILD GRAPES

AND NOW O INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND MEN OF JUDAH JUDGE BETWEEN ME AND MY VINEYARD

WHAT MORE WAS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE IN IT

WHEN I LOOKED FOR IT TO YIELD GRAPES WHY DID IT YIELD WILD GRAPES

AND NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO TO MY VINEYARD

I WILL REMOVE ITS HEDGE AND IT SHALL BE DEVOURED; I WILL BREAK DOWN ITS WALL AND IT SHALL BE TRAMPLED DOWN

I WILL MAKE IT A WASTE; IT SHALL NOT BE PRUNED OR HOED AND BRIERS AND THORNS SHALL GROW UP; I WILL ALSO COMMAND THE CLOUDS THAT THEY RAIN NO RAIN UPON IT

FOR THE VINEYARD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND THE MEN OF JUDAH ARE HIS PLEASANT PLANTING; AND HE LOOKED FOR JUSTICE BUT BEHOLD BLOODSHED; FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT BEHOLD AN OUTCRY

WOE TO THOSE WHO JOIN HOUSE TO HOUSE WHO ADD FIELD TO FIELD UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE ROOM AND YOU ARE MADE TO DWELL ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND

THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SWORN IN MY HEARING SURELY MANY HOUSES SHALL BE DESOLATE LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL HOUSES WITHOUT INHABITANT

FOR TEN ACRES OF VINEYARD SHALL YIELD BUT ONE BATH AND A HOMER OF SEED SHALL YIELD BUT AN EPHAH

 WOE TO THOSE WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT THEY MAY RUN AFTER STRONG DRINK WHO TARRY LATE INTO THE EVENING AS WINE INFLAMES THEM

THEY HAVE LYRE AND HARP TAMBOURINE AND FLUTE AND WINE AT THEIR FEASTS BUT THEY DO NOT REGARD THE DEEDS OF THE LORD OR SEE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS

THEREFORE MY PEOPLE GO INTO EXILE FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE; THEIR HONORED MEN GO HUNGRY AND THEIR MULTITUDE IS PARCHED WITH THIRST

THEREFORE SHEOL HAS ENLARGED ITS APPETITE AND OPENED ITS MOUTH BEYOND MEASURE AND THE NOBILITY OF JERUSALEM AND HER MULTITUDE WILL GO DOWN HER REVELERS AND HE WHO EXULTS IN HER

MAN IS HUMBLED AND EACH ONE IS BROUGHT LOW AND THE EYES OF THE HAUGHTY ARE BROUGHT LOW

BUT THE LORD OF HOSTS IS EXALTED IN JUSTICE AND THE HOLY GOD SHOWS HIMSELF HOLY IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

THEN SHALL THE LAMBS GRAZE AS IN THEIR PASTURE AND NOMADS SHALL EAT AMONG THE RUINS OF THE RICH

WOE TO THOSE WHO DRAW INIQUITY WITH CORDS OF FALSEHOOD WHO DRAW SIN AS WITH CART ROPES WHO SAY LET HIM BE QUICK LET HIM SPEED HIS WORK THAT WE MAY SEE IT; LET THE COUNSEL OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL DRAW NEAR AND LET IT COME THAT WE MAY KNOW IT

 WOE TO THOSE WHO CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL WHO PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS WHO PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER

WOE TO THOSE WHO ARE WISE IN THEIR OWN EYES AND SHREWD IN THEIR OWN SIGHT

WOE TO THOSE WHO ARE HEROES AT DRINKING WINE AND VALIANT MEN IN MIXING STRONG DRINK WHO ACQUIT THE GUILTY FOR A BRIBE AND DEPRIVE THE INNOCENT OF HIS RIGHT

THEREFORE AS THE TONGUE OF FIRE DEVOURS THE STUBBLE AND AS DRY GRASS SINKS DOWN IN THE FLAME SO THEIR ROOT WILL BE AS ROTTENNESS AND THEIR BLOSSOM GO UP LIKE DUST; FOR THEY HAVE REJECTED THE LAW OF THE LORD OF HOSTS AND HAVE DESPISED THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

THEREFORE THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AND HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AGAINST THEM AND STRUCK THEM AND THE MOUNTAINS QUAKED; AND THEIR CORPSES WERE AS REFUSE IN THE MIDST OF THE STREETS

FOR ALL THIS HIS ANGER HAS NOT TURNED AWAY AND HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT STILL

HE WILL RAISE A SIGNAL FOR NATIONS AFAR OFF AND WHISTLE FOR THEM FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH; AND BEHOLD QUICKLY SPEEDILY THEY COME

NONE IS WEARY NONE STUMBLES NONE SLUMBERS OR SLEEPS NOT A WAISTBAND IS LOOSE NOT A SANDAL STRAP BROKEN; THEIR ARROWS ARE SHARP ALL THEIR BOWS BENT THEIR HORSES' HOOFS SEEM LIKE FLINT AND THEIR WHEELS LIKE THE WHIRLWIND

THEIR ROARING IS LIKE A LION LIKE YOUNG LIONS THEY ROAR; THEY GROWL AND SEIZE THEIR PREY; THEY CARRY IT OFF AND NONE CAN RESCUE

THEY WILL GROWL OVER IT ON THAT DAY LIKE THE GROWLING OF THE SEA

AND IF ONE LOOKS TO THE LAND BEHOLD DARKNESS AND DISTRESS; AND THE LIGHT IS DARKENED BY ITS CLOUDS

IN THE YEAR THAT KING UZZIAH DIED I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON A THRONE HIGH AND LIFTED UP; AND THE TRAIN OF HIS ROBE FILLED THE TEMPLE

ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM

EACH HAD SIX WINGS WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FACE AND WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET AND WITH TWO HE FLEW

AND ONE CALLED TO ANOTHER AND SAID HOLY HOLY HOLY IS THE LORD OF HOSTS; THE WHOLE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS GLORY

 AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE THRESHOLDS SHOOK AT THE VOICE OF HIM WHO CALLED AND THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE

AND I SAID WOE IS ME

FOR I AM LOST; FOR I AM A MAN OF UNCLEAN LIPS AND I DWELL IN THE MIDST OF A PEOPLE OF UNCLEAN LIPS; FOR MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE KING THE LORD OF HOSTS

 THEN ONE OF THE SERAPHIM FLEW TO ME HAVING IN HIS HAND A BURNING COAL THAT HE HAD TAKEN WITH TONGS FROM THE ALTAR

AND HE TOUCHED MY MOUTH AND SAID BEHOLD THIS HAS TOUCHED YOUR LIPS; YOUR GUILT IS TAKEN AWAY AND YOUR SIN ATONED FOR

AND I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD SAYING WHOM SHALL I SEND AND WHO WILL GO FOR US

 THEN I SAID HERE AM I

SEND ME

 AND HE SAID GO AND SAY TO THIS PEOPLE 'KEEP ON HEARING BUT DO NOT UNDERSTAND; KEEP ON SEEING BUT DO NOT PERCEIVE

' MAKE THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE DULL AND THEIR EARS HEAVY AND BLIND THEIR EYES; LEST THEY SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEARTS AND TURN AND BE HEALED

 THEN I SAID HOW LONG O LORD

 AND HE SAID UNTIL CITIES LIE WASTE WITHOUT INHABITANT AND HOUSES WITHOUT PEOPLE AND THE LAND IS A DESOLATE WASTE AND THE LORD REMOVES PEOPLE FAR AWAY AND THE FORSAKEN PLACES ARE MANY IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND

AND THOUGH A TENTH REMAIN IN IT IT WILL BE BURNED AGAIN LIKE A TEREBINTH OR AN OAK WHOSE STUMP REMAINS WHEN IT IS FELLED

 THE HOLY SEED IS ITS STUMP

IN THE DAYS OF AHAZ THE SON OF JOTHAM SON OF UZZIAH KING OF JUDAH REZIN THE KING OF SYRIA AND PEKAH THE SON OF REMALIAH THE KING OF ISRAEL CAME UP TO JERUSALEM TO WAGE WAR AGAINST IT BUT COULD NOT YET MOUNT AN ATTACK AGAINST IT

WHEN THE HOUSE OF DAVID WAS TOLD SYRIA IS IN LEAGUE WITH EPHRAIM THE HEART OF AHAZ AND THE HEART OF HIS PEOPLE SHOOK AS THE TREES OF THE FOREST SHAKE BEFORE THE WIND

AND THE LORD SAID TO ISAIAH GO OUT TO MEET AHAZ YOU AND SHEARJASHUB YOUR SON AT THE END OF THE CONDUIT OF THE UPPER POOL ON THE HIGHWAY TO THE WASHER'S FIELD

AND SAY TO HIM 'BE CAREFUL BE QUIET DO NOT FEAR AND DO NOT LET YOUR HEART BE FAINT BECAUSE OF THESE TWO SMOLDERING STUMPS OF FIREBRANDS AT THE FIERCE ANGER OF REZIN AND SYRIA AND THE SON OF REMALIAH

BECAUSE SYRIA WITH EPHRAIM AND THE SON OF REMALIAH HAS DEVISED EVIL AGAINST YOU SAYING LET US GO UP AGAINST JUDAH AND TERRIFY IT AND LET US CONQUER IT FOR OURSELVES AND SET UP THE SON OF TABEEL AS KING IN THE MIDST OF IT THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD 'IT SHALL NOT STAND AND IT SHALL NOT COME TO PASS

FOR THE HEAD OF SYRIA IS DAMASCUS AND THE HEAD OF DAMASCUS IS REZIN

WITHIN SIXTYFIVE YEARS EPHRAIM WILL BE BROKEN TO PIECES SO THAT IT WILL NO LONGER BE A PEOPLE

 'AND THE HEAD OF EPHRAIM IS SAMARIA AND THE HEAD OF SAMARIA IS THE SON OF REMALIAH

IF YOU ARE NOT FIRM IN FAITH YOU WILL NOT BE FIRM AT ALL

' AGAIN THE LORD SPOKE TO AHAZ ASK A SIGN OF THE LORD YOUR GOD; LET IT BE DEEP AS SHEOL OR HIGH AS HEAVEN

 BUT AHAZ SAID I WILL NOT ASK AND I WILL NOT PUT THE LORD TO THE TEST

 AND HE SAID HEAR THEN O HOUSE OF DAVID

IS IT TOO LITTLE FOR YOU TO WEARY MEN THAT YOU WEARY MY GOD ALSO

THEREFORE THE LORD HIMSELF WILL GIVE YOU A SIGN

BEHOLD THE VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE AND BEAR A SON AND SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL

HE SHALL EAT CURDS AND HONEY WHEN HE KNOWS HOW TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD

FOR BEFORE THE BOY KNOWS HOW TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD THE LAND WHOSE TWO KINGS YOU DREAD WILL BE DESERTED

THE LORD WILL BRING UPON YOU AND UPON YOUR PEOPLE AND UPON YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE SUCH DAYS AS HAVE NOT COME SINCE THE DAY THAT EPHRAIM DEPARTED FROM JUDAHTHE KING OF ASSYRIA

 IN THAT DAY THE LORD WILL WHISTLE FOR THE FLY THAT IS AT THE END OF THE STREAMS OF EGYPT AND FOR THE BEE THAT IS IN THE LAND OF ASSYRIA

AND THEY WILL ALL COME AND SETTLE IN THE STEEP RAVINES AND IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCKS AND ON ALL THE THORNBUSHES AND ON ALL THE PASTURES

IN THAT DAY THE LORD WILL SHAVE WITH A RAZOR THAT IS HIRED BEYOND THE RIVERWITH THE KING OF ASSYRIATHE HEAD AND THE HAIR OF THE FEET AND IT WILL SWEEP AWAY THE BEARD ALSO

IN THAT DAY A MAN WILL KEEP ALIVE A YOUNG COW AND TWO SHEEP AND BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF MILK THAT THEY GIVE HE WILL EAT CURDS FOR EVERYONE WHO IS LEFT IN THE LAND WILL EAT CURDS AND HONEY

IN THAT DAY EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE USED TO BE A THOUSAND VINES WORTH A THOUSAND SHEKELS OF SILVER WILL BECOME BRIERS AND THORNS

WITH BOW AND ARROWS A MAN WILL COME THERE FOR ALL THE LAND WILL BE BRIERS AND THORNS

AND AS FOR ALL THE HILLS THAT USED TO BE HOED WITH A HOE YOU WILL NOT COME THERE FOR FEAR OF BRIERS AND THORNS BUT THEY WILL BECOME A PLACE WHERE CATTLE ARE LET LOOSE AND WHERE SHEEP TREAD

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME TAKE A LARGE TABLET AND WRITE ON IT IN COMMON CHARACTERS 'BELONGING TO MAHERSHALALHASHBAZ

' AND I WILL GET RELIABLE WITNESSES URIAH THE PRIEST AND ZECHARIAH THE SON OF JEBERECHIAH TO ATTEST FOR ME

 AND I WENT TO THE PROPHETESS AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME CALL HIS NAME MAHERSHALALHASHBAZ; FOR BEFORE THE BOY KNOWS HOW TO CRY 'MY FATHER' OR 'MY MOTHER' THE WEALTH OF DAMASCUS AND THE SPOIL OF SAMARIA WILL BE CARRIED AWAY BEFORE THE KING OF ASSYRIA

 THE LORD SPOKE TO ME AGAIN BECAUSE THIS PEOPLE HAVE REFUSED THE WATERS OF SHILOAH THAT FLOW GENTLY AND REJOICE OVER REZIN AND THE SON OF REMALIAH THEREFORE BEHOLD THE LORD IS BRINGING UP AGAINST THEM THE WATERS OF THE RIVER MIGHTY AND MANY THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND ALL HIS GLORY

AND IT WILL RISE OVER ALL ITS CHANNELS AND GO OVER ALL ITS BANKS AND IT WILL SWEEP ON INTO JUDAH IT WILL OVERFLOW AND PASS ON REACHING EVEN TO THE NECK AND ITS OUTSPREAD WINGS WILL FILL THE BREADTH OF YOUR LAND O IMMANUEL

 BE BROKEN YOU PEOPLES AND BE SHATTERED; GIVE EAR ALL YOU FAR COUNTRIES; STRAP ON YOUR ARMOR AND BE SHATTERED; STRAP ON YOUR ARMOR AND BE SHATTERED

TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER BUT IT WILL COME TO NOTHING; SPEAK A WORD BUT IT WILL NOT STAND FOR GOD IS WITH US

FOR THE LORD SPOKE THUS TO ME WITH HIS STRONG HAND UPON ME AND WARNED ME NOT TO WALK IN THE WAY OF THIS PEOPLE SAYING DO NOT CALL CONSPIRACY ALL THAT THIS PEOPLE CALLS CONSPIRACY AND DO NOT FEAR WHAT THEY FEAR NOR BE IN DREAD

BUT THE LORD OF HOSTS HIM YOU SHALL REGARD AS HOLY

LET HIM BE YOUR FEAR AND LET HIM BE YOUR DREAD

AND HE WILL BECOME A SANCTUARY AND A STONE OF OFFENSE AND A ROCK OF STUMBLING TO BOTH HOUSES OF ISRAEL A TRAP AND A SNARE TO THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

AND MANY SHALL STUMBLE ON IT

THEY SHALL FALL AND BE BROKEN; THEY SHALL BE SNARED AND TAKEN

 BIND UP THE TESTIMONY; SEAL THE TEACHING AMONG MY DISCIPLES

I WILL WAIT FOR THE LORD WHO IS HIDING HIS FACE FROM THE HOUSE OF JACOB AND I WILL HOPE IN HIM

BEHOLD I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM THE LORD HAS GIVEN ME ARE SIGNS AND PORTENTS IN ISRAEL FROM THE LORD OF HOSTS WHO DWELLS ON MOUNT ZION

AND WHEN THEY SAY TO YOU INQUIRE OF THE MEDIUMS AND THE NECROMANCERS WHO CHIRP AND MUTTER SHOULD NOT A PEOPLE INQUIRE OF THEIR GOD

SHOULD THEY INQUIRE OF THE DEAD ON BEHALF OF THE LIVING

TO THE TEACHING AND TO THE TESTIMONY

IF THEY WILL NOT SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO DAWN

THEY WILL PASS THROUGH THE LAND GREATLY DISTRESSED AND HUNGRY

AND WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY THEY WILL BE ENRAGED AND WILL SPEAK CONTEMPTUOUSLY AGAINST THEIR KING AND THEIR GOD AND TURN THEIR FACES UPWARD

AND THEY WILL LOOK TO THE EARTH BUT BEHOLD DISTRESS AND DARKNESS THE GLOOM OF ANGUISH

AND THEY WILL BE THRUST INTO THICK DARKNESS

BUT THERE WILL BE NO GLOOM FOR HER WHO WAS IN ANGUISH

IN THE FORMER TIME HE BROUGHT INTO CONTEMPT THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI BUT IN THE LATTER TIME HE HAS MADE GLORIOUS THE WAY OF THE SEA THE LAND BEYOND THE JORDAN GALILEE OF THE NATIONS

THE PEOPLE WHO WALKED IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT; THOSE WHO DWELT IN A LAND OF DEEP DARKNESS ON THEM HAS LIGHT SHINED

YOU HAVE MULTIPLIED THE NATION; YOU HAVE INCREASED ITS JOY; THEY REJOICE BEFORE YOU AS WITH JOY AT THE HARVEST AS THEY ARE GLAD WHEN THEY DIVIDE THE SPOIL

FOR THE YOKE OF HIS BURDEN AND THE STAFF FOR HIS SHOULDER THE ROD OF HIS OPPRESSOR YOU HAVE BROKEN AS ON THE DAY OF MIDIAN

FOR EVERY BOOT OF THE TRAMPING WARRIOR IN BATTLE TUMULT AND EVERY GARMENT ROLLED IN BLOOD WILL BE BURNED AS FUEL FOR THE FIRE

FOR TO US A CHILD IS BORN TO US A SON IS GIVEN; AND THE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE UPON HIS SHOULDER AND HIS NAME SHALL BE CALLED WONDERFUL COUNSELOR MIGHTY GOD EVERLASTING FATHER PRINCE OF PEACE

OF THE INCREASE OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND OF PEACE THERE WILL BE NO END ON THE THRONE OF DAVID AND OVER HIS KINGDOM TO ESTABLISH IT AND TO UPHOLD IT WITH JUSTICE AND WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

THE ZEAL OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL DO THIS

THE LORD HAS SENT A WORD AGAINST JACOB AND IT WILL FALL ON ISRAEL; AND ALL THE PEOPLE WILL KNOW EPHRAIM AND THE INHABITANTS OF SAMARIA WHO SAY IN PRIDE AND IN ARROGANCE OF HEART THE BRICKS HAVE FALLEN BUT WE WILL BUILD WITH DRESSED STONES; THE SYCAMORES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN BUT WE WILL PUT CEDARS IN THEIR PLACE

 BUT THE LORD RAISES THE ADVERSARIES OF REZIN AGAINST HIM AND STIRS UP HIS ENEMIES

THE SYRIANS ON THE EAST AND THE PHILISTINES ON THE WEST DEVOUR ISRAEL WITH OPEN MOUTH

FOR ALL THIS HIS ANGER HAS NOT TURNED AWAY AND HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT STILL

THE PEOPLE DID NOT TURN TO HIM WHO STRUCK THEM NOR INQUIRE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS

SO THE LORD CUT OFF FROM ISRAEL HEAD AND TAIL PALM BRANCH AND REED IN ONE DAY THE ELDER AND HONORED MAN IS THE HEAD AND THE PROPHET WHO TEACHES LIES IS THE TAIL; FOR THOSE WHO GUIDE THIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEADING THEM ASTRAY AND THOSE WHO ARE GUIDED BY THEM ARE SWALLOWED UP

THEREFORE THE LORD DOES NOT REJOICE OVER THEIR YOUNG MEN AND HAS NO COMPASSION ON THEIR FATHERLESS AND WIDOWS; FOR EVERYONE IS GODLESS AND AN EVILDOER AND EVERY MOUTH SPEAKS FOLLY

FOR ALL THIS HIS ANGER HAS NOT TURNED AWAY AND HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT STILL

FOR WICKEDNESS BURNS LIKE A FIRE; IT CONSUMES BRIERS AND THORNS; IT KINDLES THE THICKETS OF THE FOREST AND THEY ROLL UPWARD IN A COLUMN OF SMOKE

THROUGH THE WRATH OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE LAND IS SCORCHED AND THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE FUEL FOR THE FIRE; NO ONE SPARES ANOTHER

THEY SLICE MEAT ON THE RIGHT BUT ARE STILL HUNGRY AND THEY DEVOUR ON THE LEFT BUT ARE NOT SATISFIED; EACH DEVOURS THE FLESH OF HIS OWN ARM MANASSEH DEVOURS EPHRAIM AND EPHRAIM DEVOURS MANASSEH; TOGETHER THEY ARE AGAINST JUDAH

FOR ALL THIS HIS ANGER HAS NOT TURNED AWAY AND HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT STILL

WOE TO THOSE WHO DECREE INIQUITOUS DECREES AND THE WRITERS WHO KEEP WRITING OPPRESSION TO TURN ASIDE THE NEEDY FROM JUSTICE AND TO ROB THE POOR OF MY PEOPLE OF THEIR RIGHT THAT WIDOWS MAY BE THEIR SPOIL AND THAT THEY MAY MAKE THE FATHERLESS THEIR PREY

WHAT WILL YOU DO ON THE DAY OF PUNISHMENT IN THE RUIN THAT WILL COME FROM AFAR

TO WHOM WILL YOU FLEE FOR HELP AND WHERE WILL YOU LEAVE YOUR WEALTH

NOTHING REMAINS BUT TO CROUCH AMONG THE PRISONERS OR FALL AMONG THE SLAIN

FOR ALL THIS HIS ANGER HAS NOT TURNED AWAY AND HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT STILL

AH ASSYRIA THE ROD OF MY ANGER; THE STAFF IN THEIR HANDS IS MY FURY

AGAINST A GODLESS NATION I SEND HIM AND AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF MY WRATH I COMMAND HIM TO TAKE SPOIL AND SEIZE PLUNDER AND TO TREAD THEM DOWN LIKE THE MIRE OF THE STREETS

BUT HE DOES NOT SO INTEND AND HIS HEART DOES NOT SO THINK; BUT IT IS IN HIS HEART TO DESTROY AND TO CUT OFF NATIONS NOT A FEW; FOR HE SAYS ARE NOT MY COMMANDERS ALL KINGS

IS NOT CALNO LIKE CARCHEMISH

IS NOT HAMATH LIKE ARPAD

IS NOT SAMARIA LIKE DAMASCUS

AS MY HAND HAS REACHED TO THE KINGDOMS OF THE IDOLS WHOSE CARVED IMAGES WERE GREATER THAN THOSE OF JERUSALEM AND SAMARIA SHALL I NOT DO TO JERUSALEM AND HER IDOLS AS I HAVE DONE TO SAMARIA AND HER IMAGES

 WHEN THE LORD HAS FINISHED ALL HIS WORK ON MOUNT ZION AND ON JERUSALEM HE WILL PUNISH THE SPEECH OF THE ARROGANT HEART OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND THE BOASTFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES

FOR HE SAYS BY THE STRENGTH OF MY HAND I HAVE DONE IT AND BY MY WISDOM FOR I HAVE UNDERSTANDING; I REMOVE THE BOUNDARIES OF PEOPLES AND PLUNDER THEIR TREASURES; LIKE A BULL I BRING DOWN THOSE WHO SIT ON THRONES

MY HAND HAS FOUND LIKE A NEST THE WEALTH OF THE PEOPLES; AND AS ONE GATHERS EGGS THAT HAVE BEEN FORSAKEN SO I HAVE GATHERED ALL THE EARTH; AND THERE WAS NONE THAT MOVED A WING OR OPENED THE MOUTH OR CHIRPED

 SHALL THE AXE BOAST OVER HIM WHO HEWS WITH IT OR THE SAW MAGNIFY ITSELF AGAINST HIM WHO WIELDS IT

AS IF A ROD SHOULD WIELD HIM WHO LIFTS IT OR AS IF A STAFF SHOULD LIFT HIM WHO IS NOT WOOD

THEREFORE THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS WILL SEND WASTING SICKNESS AMONG HIS STOUT WARRIORS AND UNDER HIS GLORY A BURNING WILL BE KINDLED LIKE THE BURNING OF FIRE

THE LIGHT OF ISRAEL WILL BECOME A FIRE AND HIS HOLY ONE A FLAME AND IT WILL BURN AND DEVOUR HIS THORNS AND BRIERS IN ONE DAY

THE GLORY OF HIS FOREST AND OF HIS FRUITFUL LAND THE LORD WILL DESTROY BOTH SOUL AND BODY AND IT WILL BE AS WHEN A SICK MAN WASTES AWAY

THE REMNANT OF THE TREES OF HIS FOREST WILL BE SO FEW THAT A CHILD CAN WRITE THEM DOWN

IN THAT DAY THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL AND THE SURVIVORS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB WILL NO MORE LEAN ON HIM WHO STRUCK THEM BUT WILL LEAN ON THE LORD THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL IN TRUTH

A REMNANT WILL RETURN THE REMNANT OF JACOB TO THE MIGHTY GOD

FOR THOUGH YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA ONLY A REMNANT OF THEM WILL RETURN

DESTRUCTION IS DECREED OVERFLOWING WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS

FOR THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS WILL MAKE A FULL END AS DECREED IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE EARTH

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS O MY PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN ZION BE NOT AFRAID OF THE ASSYRIANS WHEN THEY STRIKE WITH THE ROD AND LIFT UP THEIR STAFF AGAINST YOU AS THE EGYPTIANS DID

FOR IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE MY FURY WILL COME TO AN END AND MY ANGER WILL BE DIRECTED TO THEIR DESTRUCTION

AND THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL WIELD AGAINST THEM A WHIP AS WHEN HE STRUCK MIDIAN AT THE ROCK OF OREB

AND HIS STAFF WILL BE OVER THE SEA AND HE WILL LIFT IT AS HE DID IN EGYPT

AND IN THAT DAY HIS BURDEN WILL DEPART FROM YOUR SHOULDER AND HIS YOKE FROM YOUR NECK; AND THE YOKE WILL BE BROKEN BECAUSE OF THE FAT

 HE HAS COME TO AIATH; HE HAS PASSED THROUGH MIGRON; AT MICHMASH HE STORES HIS BAGGAGE; THEY HAVE CROSSED OVER THE PASS; AT GEBA THEY LODGE FOR THE NIGHT; RAMAH TREMBLES; GIBEAH OF SAUL HAS FLED

CRY ALOUD O DAUGHTER OF GALLIM

GIVE ATTENTION O LAISHAH

O POOR ANATHOTH

MADMENAH IS IN FLIGHT; THE INHABITANTS OF GEBIM FLEE FOR SAFETY

THIS VERY DAY HE WILL HALT AT NOB; HE WILL SHAKE HIS FIST AT THE MOUNT OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION THE HILL OF JERUSALEM

BEHOLD THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS WILL LOP THE BOUGHS WITH TERRIFYING POWER; THE GREAT IN HEIGHT WILL BE HEWN DOWN AND THE LOFTY WILL BE BROUGHT LOW

HE WILL CUT DOWN THE THICKETS OF THE FOREST WITH AN AXE AND LEBANON WILL FALL BY THE MAJESTIC ONE

THERE SHALL COME FORTH A SHOOT FROM THE STUMP OF JESSE AND A BRANCH FROM HIS ROOTS SHALL BEAR FRUIT

AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD SHALL REST UPON HIM THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING THE SPIRIT OF COUNSEL AND MIGHT THE SPIRIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE FEAR OF THE LORD

AND HIS DELIGHT SHALL BE IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD

HE SHALL NOT JUDGE BY WHAT HIS EYES SEE OR DECIDE DISPUTES BY WHAT HIS EARS HEAR BUT WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS HE SHALL JUDGE THE POOR AND DECIDE WITH EQUITY FOR THE MEEK OF THE EARTH; AND HE SHALL STRIKE THE EARTH WITH THE ROD OF HIS MOUTH AND WITH THE BREATH OF HIS LIPS HE SHALL KILL THE WICKED

RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL BE THE BELT OF HIS WAIST AND FAITHFULNESS THE BELT OF HIS LOINS

THE WOLF SHALL DWELL WITH THE LAMB AND THE LEOPARD SHALL LIE DOWN WITH THE YOUNG GOAT AND THE CALF AND THE LION AND THE FATTENED CALF TOGETHER; AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM

THE COW AND THE BEAR SHALL GRAZE; THEIR YOUNG SHALL LIE DOWN TOGETHER; AND THE LION SHALL EAT STRAW LIKE THE OX

THE NURSING CHILD SHALL PLAY OVER THE HOLE OF THE COBRA AND THE WEANED CHILD SHALL PUT HIS HAND ON THE ADDER'S DEN

THEY SHALL NOT HURT OR DESTROY IN ALL MY HOLY MOUNTAIN; FOR THE EARTH SHALL BE FULL OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD AS THE WATERS COVER THE SEA

IN THAT DAY THE ROOT OF JESSE WHO SHALL STAND AS A SIGNAL FOR THE PEOPLESOF HIM SHALL THE NATIONS INQUIRE AND HIS RESTING PLACE SHALL BE GLORIOUS

IN THAT DAY THE LORD WILL EXTEND HIS HAND YET A SECOND TIME TO RECOVER THE REMNANT THAT REMAINS OF HIS PEOPLE FROM ASSYRIA FROM EGYPT FROM PATHROS FROM CUSH FROM ELAM FROM SHINAR FROM HAMATH AND FROM THE COASTLANDS OF THE SEA

HE WILL RAISE A SIGNAL FOR THE NATIONS AND WILL ASSEMBLE THE BANISHED OF ISRAEL AND GATHER THE DISPERSED OF JUDAH FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH

THE JEALOUSY OF EPHRAIM SHALL DEPART AND THOSE WHO HARASS JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF; EPHRAIM SHALL NOT BE JEALOUS OF JUDAH AND JUDAH SHALL NOT HARASS EPHRAIM

BUT THEY SHALL SWOOP DOWN ON THE SHOULDER OF THE PHILISTINES IN THE WEST AND TOGETHER THEY SHALL PLUNDER THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST

THEY SHALL PUT OUT THEIR HAND AGAINST EDOM AND MOAB AND THE AMMONITES SHALL OBEY THEM

AND THE LORD WILL UTTERLY DESTROY THE TONGUE OF THE SEA OF EGYPT AND WILL WAVE HIS HAND OVER THE RIVER WITH HIS SCORCHING BREATH AND STRIKE IT INTO SEVEN CHANNELS AND HE WILL LEAD PEOPLE ACROSS IN SANDALS

AND THERE WILL BE A HIGHWAY FROM ASSYRIA FOR THE REMNANT THAT REMAINS OF HIS PEOPLE AS THERE WAS FOR ISRAEL WHEN THEY CAME UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT

YOU WILL SAY IN THAT DAY I WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU O LORD FOR THOUGH YOU WERE ANGRY WITH ME YOUR ANGER TURNED AWAY THAT YOU MIGHT COMFORT ME

BEHOLD GOD IS MY SALVATION; I WILL TRUST AND WILL NOT BE AFRAID; FOR THE LORD GOD IS MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG AND HE HAS BECOME MY SALVATION

 WITH JOY YOU WILL DRAW WATER FROM THE WELLS OF SALVATION

AND YOU WILL SAY IN THAT DAY GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD CALL UPON HIS NAME MAKE KNOWN HIS DEEDS AMONG THE PEOPLES PROCLAIM THAT HIS NAME IS EXALTED

SING PRAISES TO THE LORD FOR HE HAS DONE GLORIOUSLY; LET THIS BE MADE KNOWN IN ALL THE EARTH

SHOUT AND SING FOR JOY O INHABITANT OF ZION FOR GREAT IN YOUR MIDST IS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

THE ORACLE CONCERNING BABYLON WHICH ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ SAW

ON A BARE HILL RAISE A SIGNAL; CRY ALOUD TO THEM; WAVE THE HAND FOR THEM TO ENTER THE GATES OF THE NOBLES

I MYSELF HAVE COMMANDED MY CONSECRATED ONES AND HAVE SUMMONED MY MIGHTY MEN TO EXECUTE MY ANGER MY PROUDLY EXULTING ONES

THE SOUND OF A TUMULT IS ON THE MOUNTAINS AS OF A GREAT MULTITUDE

THE SOUND OF AN UPROAR OF KINGDOMS OF NATIONS GATHERING TOGETHER

THE LORD OF HOSTS IS MUSTERING A HOST FOR BATTLE

THEY COME FROM A DISTANT LAND FROM THE END OF THE HEAVENS THE LORD AND THE WEAPONS OF HIS INDIGNATION TO DESTROY THE WHOLE LAND

WAIL FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR; AS DESTRUCTION FROM THE ALMIGHTY IT WILL COME

THEREFORE ALL HANDS WILL BE FEEBLE AND EVERY HUMAN HEART WILL MELT

THEY WILL BE DISMAYED PANGS AND AGONY WILL SEIZE THEM; THEY WILL BE IN ANGUISH LIKE A WOMAN IN LABOR

THEY WILL LOOK AGHAST AT ONE ANOTHER; THEIR FACES WILL BE AFLAME

BEHOLD THE DAY OF THE LORD COMES CRUEL WITH WRATH AND FIERCE ANGER TO MAKE THE LAND A DESOLATION AND TO DESTROY ITS SINNERS FROM IT

FOR THE STARS OF THE HEAVENS AND THEIR CONSTELLATIONS WILL NOT GIVE THEIR LIGHT; THE SUN WILL BE DARK AT ITS RISING AND THE MOON WILL NOT SHED ITS LIGHT

I WILL PUNISH THE WORLD FOR ITS EVIL AND THE WICKED FOR THEIR INIQUITY; I WILL PUT AN END TO THE POMP OF THE ARROGANT AND LAY LOW THE POMPOUS PRIDE OF THE RUTHLESS

I WILL MAKE PEOPLE MORE RARE THAN FINE GOLD AND MANKIND THAN THE GOLD OF OPHIR

THEREFORE I WILL MAKE THE HEAVENS TREMBLE AND THE EARTH WILL BE SHAKEN OUT OF ITS PLACE AT THE WRATH OF THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THE DAY OF HIS FIERCE ANGER

AND LIKE A HUNTED GAZELLE OR LIKE SHEEP WITH NONE TO GATHER THEM EACH WILL TURN TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND EACH WILL FLEE TO HIS OWN LAND

WHOEVER IS FOUND WILL BE THRUST THROUGH AND WHOEVER IS CAUGHT WILL FALL BY THE SWORD

THEIR INFANTS WILL BE DASHED IN PIECES BEFORE THEIR EYES; THEIR HOUSES WILL BE PLUNDERED AND THEIR WIVES RAVISHED

BEHOLD I AM STIRRING UP THE MEDES AGAINST THEM WHO HAVE NO REGARD FOR SILVER AND DO NOT DELIGHT IN GOLD

THEIR BOWS WILL SLAUGHTER THE YOUNG MEN; THEY WILL HAVE NO MERCY ON THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB; THEIR EYES WILL NOT PITY CHILDREN

AND BABYLON THE GLORY OF KINGDOMS THE SPLENDOR AND POMP OF THE CHALDEANS WILL BE LIKE SODOM AND GOMORRAH WHEN GOD OVERTHREW THEM

IT WILL NEVER BE INHABITED OR LIVED IN FOR ALL GENERATIONS; NO ARAB WILL PITCH HIS TENT THERE; NO SHEPHERDS WILL MAKE THEIR FLOCKS LIE DOWN THERE

BUT WILD ANIMALS WILL LIE DOWN THERE AND THEIR HOUSES WILL BE FULL OF HOWLING CREATURES; THERE OSTRICHES WILL DWELL AND THERE WILD GOATS WILL DANCE

HYENAS WILL CRY IN ITS TOWERS AND JACKALS IN THE PLEASANT PALACES; ITS TIME IS CLOSE AT HAND AND ITS DAYS WILL NOT BE PROLONGED

FOR THE LORD WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON JACOB AND WILL AGAIN CHOOSE ISRAEL AND WILL SET THEM IN THEIR OWN LAND AND SOJOURNERS WILL JOIN THEM AND WILL ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB

AND THE PEOPLES WILL TAKE THEM AND BRING THEM TO THEIR PLACE AND THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WILL POSSESS THEM IN THE LORD'S LAND AS MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES

THEY WILL TAKE CAPTIVE THOSE WHO WERE THEIR CAPTORS AND RULE OVER THOSE WHO OPPRESSED THEM

WHEN THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU REST FROM YOUR PAIN AND TURMOIL AND THE HARD SERVICE WITH WHICH YOU WERE MADE TO SERVE YOU WILL TAKE UP THIS TAUNT AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON HOW THE OPPRESSOR HAS CEASED THE INSOLENT FURY CEASED

THE LORD HAS BROKEN THE STAFF OF THE WICKED THE SCEPTER OF RULERS THAT STRUCK THE PEOPLES IN WRATH WITH UNCEASING BLOWS THAT RULED THE NATIONS IN ANGER WITH UNRELENTING PERSECUTION

THE WHOLE EARTH IS AT REST AND QUIET; THEY BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING

THE CYPRESSES REJOICE AT YOU THE CEDARS OF LEBANON SAYING 'SINCE YOU WERE LAID LOW NO WOODCUTTER COMES UP AGAINST US

' SHEOL BENEATH IS STIRRED UP TO MEET YOU WHEN YOU COME; IT ROUSES THE SHADES TO GREET YOU ALL WHO WERE LEADERS OF THE EARTH; IT RAISES FROM THEIR THRONES ALL WHO WERE KINGS OF THE NATIONS

ALL OF THEM WILL ANSWER AND SAY TO YOU 'YOU TOO HAVE BECOME AS WEAK AS WE

YOU HAVE BECOME LIKE US

' YOUR POMP IS BROUGHT DOWN TO SHEOL THE SOUND OF YOUR HARPS; MAGGOTS ARE LAID AS A BED BENEATH YOU AND WORMS ARE YOUR COVERS

HOW YOU ARE FALLEN FROM HEAVEN O DAY STAR SON OF DAWN

HOW YOU ARE CUT DOWN TO THE GROUND YOU WHO LAID THE NATIONS LOW

YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART 'I WILL ASCEND TO HEAVEN; ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD I WILL SET MY THRONE ON HIGH; I WILL SIT ON THE MOUNT OF ASSEMBLY IN THE FAR REACHES OF THE NORTH; I WILL ASCEND ABOVE THE HEIGHTS OF THE CLOUDS; I WILL MAKE MYSELF LIKE THE MOST HIGH

' BUT YOU ARE BROUGHT DOWN TO SHEOL TO THE FAR REACHES OF THE PIT

THOSE WHO SEE YOU WILL STARE AT YOU AND PONDER OVER YOU 'IS THIS THE MAN WHO MADE THE EARTH TREMBLE WHO SHOOK KINGDOMS WHO MADE THE WORLD LIKE A DESERT AND OVERTHREW ITS CITIES WHO DID NOT LET HIS PRISONERS GO HOME

' ALL THE KINGS OF THE NATIONS LIE IN GLORY EACH IN HIS OWN TOMB; BUT YOU ARE CAST OUT AWAY FROM YOUR GRAVE LIKE A LOATHED BRANCH CLOTHED WITH THE SLAIN THOSE PIERCED BY THE SWORD WHO GO DOWN TO THE STONES OF THE PIT LIKE A DEAD BODY TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT

YOU WILL NOT BE JOINED WITH THEM IN BURIAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE DESTROYED YOUR LAND YOU HAVE SLAIN YOUR PEOPLE

MAY THE OFFSPRING OF EVILDOERS NEVERMORE BE NAMED

PREPARE SLAUGHTER FOR HIS SONS BECAUSE OF THE GUILT OF THEIR FATHERS LEST THEY RISE AND POSSESS THE EARTH AND FILL THE FACE OF THE WORLD WITH CITIES

 I WILL RISE UP AGAINST THEM DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND WILL CUT OFF FROM BABYLON NAME AND REMNANT DESCENDANTS AND POSTERITY SAYS THE LORD

AND I WILL MAKE IT A POSSESSION OF THE HEDGEHOG AND POOLS OF WATER AND I WILL SWEEP IT WITH THE BROOM OF DESTRUCTION DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SWORN AS I HAVE PLANNED SO SHALL IT BE AND AS I HAVE PURPOSED SO SHALL IT STAND THAT I WILL BREAK THE ASSYRIAN IN MY LAND AND ON MY MOUNTAINS TRAMPLE HIM UNDERFOOT; AND HIS YOKE SHALL DEPART FROM THEM AND HIS BURDEN FROM THEIR SHOULDER

 THIS IS THE PURPOSE THAT IS PURPOSED CONCERNING THE WHOLE EARTH AND THIS IS THE HAND THAT IS STRETCHED OUT OVER ALL THE NATIONS

FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS PURPOSED AND WHO WILL ANNUL IT

HIS HAND IS STRETCHED OUT AND WHO WILL TURN IT BACK

IN THE YEAR THAT KING AHAZ DIED CAME THIS ORACLE REJOICE NOT O PHILISTIA ALL OF YOU THAT THE ROD THAT STRUCK YOU IS BROKEN FOR FROM THE SERPENT'S ROOT WILL COME FORTH AN ADDER AND ITS FRUIT WILL BE A FLYING FIERY SERPENT

AND THE FIRSTBORN OF THE POOR WILL GRAZE AND THE NEEDY LIE DOWN IN SAFETY; BUT I WILL KILL YOUR ROOT WITH FAMINE AND YOUR REMNANT IT WILL SLAY

WAIL O GATE; CRY OUT O CITY; MELT IN FEAR O PHILISTIA ALL OF YOU

FOR SMOKE COMES OUT OF THE NORTH AND THERE IS NO STRAGGLER IN HIS RANKS

WHAT WILL ONE ANSWER THE MESSENGERS OF THE NATION

THE LORD HAS FOUNDED ZION AND IN HER THE AFFLICTED OF HIS PEOPLE FIND REFUGE

AN ORACLE CONCERNING MOAB

BECAUSE AR OF MOAB IS LAID WASTE IN A NIGHT MOAB IS UNDONE; BECAUSE KIR OF MOAB IS LAID WASTE IN A NIGHT MOAB IS UNDONE

HE HAS GONE UP TO THE TEMPLE AND TO DIBON TO THE HIGH PLACES TO WEEP; OVER NEBO AND OVER MEDEBA MOAB WAILS

ON EVERY HEAD IS BALDNESS; EVERY BEARD IS SHORN; IN THE STREETS THEY WEAR SACKCLOTH; ON THE HOUSETOPS AND IN THE SQUARES EVERYONE WAILS AND MELTS IN TEARS

HESHBON AND ELEALEH CRY OUT; THEIR VOICE IS HEARD AS FAR AS JAHAZ; THEREFORE THE ARMED MEN OF MOAB CRY ALOUD; HIS SOUL TREMBLES

MY HEART CRIES OUT FOR MOAB; HER FUGITIVES FLEE TO ZOAR TO EGLATHSHELISHIYAH

FOR AT THE ASCENT OF LUHITH THEY GO UP WEEPING; ON THE ROAD TO HORONAIM THEY RAISE A CRY OF DESTRUCTION; THE WATERS OF NIMRIM ARE A DESOLATION; THE GRASS IS WITHERED THE VEGETATION FAILS THE GREENERY IS NO MORE

THEREFORE THE ABUNDANCE THEY HAVE GAINED AND WHAT THEY HAVE LAID UP THEY CARRY AWAY OVER THE BROOK OF THE WILLOWS

FOR A CRY HAS GONE AROUND THE LAND OF MOAB; HER WAILING REACHES TO EGLAIM; HER WAILING REACHES TO BEERELIM

FOR THE WATERS OF DIBON ARE FULL OF BLOOD; FOR I WILL BRING UPON DIBON EVEN MORE A LION FOR THOSE OF MOAB WHO ESCAPE FOR THE REMNANT OF THE LAND

SEND THE LAMB TO THE RULER OF THE LAND FROM SELA BY WAY OF THE DESERT TO THE MOUNT OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION

LIKE FLEEING BIRDS LIKE A SCATTERED NEST SO ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB AT THE FORDS OF THE ARNON

GIVE COUNSEL; GRANT JUSTICE; MAKE YOUR SHADE LIKE NIGHT AT THE HEIGHT OF NOON; SHELTER THE OUTCASTS; DO NOT REVEAL THE FUGITIVE; LET THE OUTCASTS OF MOAB SOJOURN AMONG YOU; BE A SHELTER TO THEM FROM THE DESTROYER

WHEN THE OPPRESSOR IS NO MORE AND DESTRUCTION HAS CEASED AND HE WHO TRAMPLES UNDERFOOT HAS VANISHED FROM THE LAND THEN A THRONE WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN STEADFAST LOVE AND ON IT WILL SIT IN FAITHFULNESS IN THE TENT OF DAVID ONE WHO JUDGES AND SEEKS JUSTICE AND IS SWIFT TO DO RIGHTEOUSNESS

 WE HAVE HEARD OF THE PRIDE OF MOABHOW PROUD HE IS

OF HIS ARROGANCE HIS PRIDE AND HIS INSOLENCE; IN HIS IDLE BOASTING HE IS NOT RIGHT

THEREFORE LET MOAB WAIL FOR MOAB LET EVERYONE WAIL

MOURN UTTERLY STRICKEN FOR THE RAISIN CAKES OF KIRHARESETH

FOR THE FIELDS OF HESHBON LANGUISH AND THE VINE OF SIBMAH; THE LORDS OF THE NATIONS HAVE STRUCK DOWN ITS BRANCHES WHICH REACHED TO JAZER AND STRAYED TO THE DESERT; ITS SHOOTS SPREAD ABROAD AND PASSED OVER THE SEA

THEREFORE I WEEP WITH THE WEEPING OF JAZER FOR THE VINE OF SIBMAH; I DRENCH YOU WITH MY TEARS O HESHBON AND ELEALEH; FOR OVER YOUR SUMMER FRUIT AND YOUR HARVEST THE SHOUT HAS CEASED

AND JOY AND GLADNESS ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE FRUITFUL FIELD AND IN THE VINEYARDS NO SONGS ARE SUNG NO CHEERS ARE RAISED; NO TREADER TREADS OUT WINE IN THE PRESSES; I HAVE PUT AN END TO THE SHOUTING

THEREFORE MY INNER PARTS MOAN LIKE A LYRE FOR MOAB AND MY INMOST SELF FOR KIRHARESETH

AND WHEN MOAB PRESENTS HIMSELF WHEN HE WEARIES HIMSELF ON THE HIGH PLACE WHEN HE COMES TO HIS SANCTUARY TO PRAY HE WILL NOT PREVAIL

THIS IS THE WORD THAT THE LORD SPOKE CONCERNING MOAB IN THE PAST

BUT NOW THE LORD HAS SPOKEN SAYING IN THREE YEARS LIKE THE YEARS OF A HIRED WORKER THE GLORY OF MOAB WILL BE BROUGHT INTO CONTEMPT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS GREAT MULTITUDE AND THOSE WHO REMAIN WILL BE VERY FEW AND FEEBLE

AN ORACLE CONCERNING DAMASCUS

BEHOLD DAMASCUS WILL CEASE TO BE A CITY AND WILL BECOME A HEAP OF RUINS

THE CITIES OF AROER ARE DESERTED; THEY WILL BE FOR FLOCKS WHICH WILL LIE DOWN AND NONE WILL MAKE THEM AFRAID

THE FORTRESS WILL DISAPPEAR FROM EPHRAIM AND THE KINGDOM FROM DAMASCUS; AND THE REMNANT OF SYRIA WILL BE LIKE THE GLORY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

AND IN THAT DAY THE GLORY OF JACOB WILL BE BROUGHT LOW AND THE FAT OF HIS FLESH WILL GROW LEAN

AND IT SHALL BE AS WHEN THE REAPER GATHERS STANDING GRAIN AND HIS ARM HARVESTS THE EARS AND AS WHEN ONE GLEANS THE EARS OF GRAIN IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

GLEANINGS WILL BE LEFT IN IT AS WHEN AN OLIVE TREE IS BEATENTWO OR THREE BERRIES IN THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST BOUGH FOUR OR FIVE ON THE BRANCHES OF A FRUIT TREE DECLARES THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL

IN THAT DAY MAN WILL LOOK TO HIS MAKER AND HIS EYES WILL LOOK ON THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

HE WILL NOT LOOK TO THE ALTARS THE WORK OF HIS HANDS AND HE WILL NOT LOOK ON WHAT HIS OWN FINGERS HAVE MADE EITHER THE ASHERIM OR THE ALTARS OF INCENSE

IN THAT DAY THEIR STRONG CITIES WILL BE LIKE THE DESERTED PLACES OF THE WOODED HEIGHTS AND THE HILLTOPS WHICH THEY DESERTED BECAUSE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND THERE WILL BE DESOLATION

FOR YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE GOD OF YOUR SALVATION AND HAVE NOT REMEMBERED THE ROCK OF YOUR REFUGE; THEREFORE THOUGH YOU PLANT PLEASANT PLANTS AND SOW THE VINEBRANCH OF A STRANGER THOUGH YOU MAKE THEM GROW ON THE DAY THAT YOU PLANT THEM AND MAKE THEM BLOSSOM IN THE MORNING THAT YOU SOW YET THE HARVEST WILL FLEE AWAY IN A DAY OF GRIEF AND INCURABLE PAIN

AH THE THUNDER OF MANY PEOPLES; THEY THUNDER LIKE THE THUNDERING OF THE SEA

AH THE ROAR OF NATIONS; THEY ROAR LIKE THE ROARING OF MIGHTY WATERS

THE NATIONS ROAR LIKE THE ROARING OF MANY WATERS BUT HE WILL REBUKE THEM AND THEY WILL FLEE FAR AWAY CHASED LIKE CHAFF ON THE MOUNTAINS BEFORE THE WIND AND WHIRLING DUST BEFORE THE STORM

AT EVENING TIME BEHOLD TERROR

BEFORE MORNING THEY ARE NO MORE

THIS IS THE PORTION OF THOSE WHO LOOT US AND THE LOT OF THOSE WHO PLUNDER US

AH LAND OF WHIRRING WINGS THAT IS BEYOND THE RIVERS OF CUSH WHICH SENDS AMBASSADORS BY THE SEA IN VESSELS OF PAPYRUS ON THE WATERS

GO YOU SWIFT MESSENGERS TO A NATION TALL AND SMOOTH TO A PEOPLE FEARED NEAR AND FAR A NATION MIGHTY AND CONQUERING WHOSE LAND THE RIVERS DIVIDE

ALL YOU INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD YOU WHO DWELL ON THE EARTH WHEN A SIGNAL IS RAISED ON THE MOUNTAINS LOOK

WHEN A TRUMPET IS BLOWN HEAR

FOR THUS THE LORD SAID TO ME I WILL QUIETLY LOOK FROM MY DWELLING LIKE CLEAR HEAT IN SUNSHINE LIKE A CLOUD OF DEW IN THE HEAT OF HARVEST

 FOR BEFORE THE HARVEST WHEN THE BLOSSOM IS OVER AND THE FLOWER BECOMES A RIPENING GRAPE HE CUTS OFF THE SHOOTS WITH PRUNING HOOKS AND THE SPREADING BRANCHES HE LOPS OFF AND CLEARS AWAY

THEY SHALL ALL OF THEM BE LEFT TO THE BIRDS OF PREY OF THE MOUNTAINS AND TO THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

AND THE BIRDS OF PREY WILL SUMMER ON THEM AND ALL THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH WILL WINTER ON THEM

AT THAT TIME TRIBUTE WILL BE BROUGHT TO THE LORD OF HOSTS FROM A PEOPLE TALL AND SMOOTH FROM A PEOPLE FEARED NEAR AND FAR A NATION MIGHTY AND CONQUERING WHOSE LAND THE RIVERS DIVIDETO MOUNT ZION THE PLACE OF THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS

AN ORACLE CONCERNING EGYPT

BEHOLD THE LORD IS RIDING ON A SWIFT CLOUD AND COMES TO EGYPT; AND THE IDOLS OF EGYPT WILL TREMBLE AT HIS PRESENCE AND THE HEART OF THE EGYPTIANS WILL MELT WITHIN THEM

AND I WILL STIR UP EGYPTIANS AGAINST EGYPTIANS AND THEY WILL FIGHT EACH AGAINST ANOTHER AND EACH AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR CITY AGAINST CITY KINGDOM AGAINST KINGDOM; AND THE SPIRIT OF THE EGYPTIANS WITHIN THEM WILL BE EMPTIED OUT AND I WILL CONFOUND THEIR COUNSEL; AND THEY WILL INQUIRE OF THE IDOLS AND THE SORCERERS AND THE MEDIUMS AND THE NECROMANCERS; AND I WILL GIVE OVER THE EGYPTIANS INTO THE HAND OF A HARD MASTER AND A FIERCE KING WILL RULE OVER THEM DECLARES THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS

AND THE WATERS OF THE SEA WILL BE DRIED UP AND THE RIVER WILL BE DRY AND PARCHED AND ITS CANALS WILL BECOME FOUL AND THE BRANCHES OF EGYPT'S NILE WILL DIMINISH AND DRY UP REEDS AND RUSHES WILL ROT AWAY

THERE WILL BE BARE PLACES BY THE NILE ON THE BRINK OF THE NILE AND ALL THAT IS SOWN BY THE NILE WILL BE PARCHED WILL BE DRIVEN AWAY AND WILL BE NO MORE

THE FISHERMEN WILL MOURN AND LAMENT ALL WHO CAST A HOOK IN THE NILE; AND THEY WILL LANGUISH WHO SPREAD NETS ON THE WATER

THE WORKERS IN COMBED FLAX WILL BE IN DESPAIR AND THE WEAVERS OF WHITE COTTON

THOSE WHO ARE THE PILLARS OF THE LAND WILL BE CRUSHED AND ALL WHO WORK FOR PAY WILL BE GRIEVED

THE PRINCES OF ZOAN ARE UTTERLY FOOLISH; THE WISEST COUNSELORS OF PHARAOH GIVE STUPID COUNSEL

HOW CAN YOU SAY TO PHARAOH I AM A SON OF THE WISE A SON OF ANCIENT KINGS

WHERE THEN ARE YOUR WISE MEN

LET THEM TELL YOU THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW WHAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS PURPOSED AGAINST EGYPT

THE PRINCES OF ZOAN HAVE BECOME FOOLS AND THE PRINCES OF MEMPHIS ARE DELUDED; THOSE WHO ARE THE CORNERSTONES OF HER TRIBES HAVE MADE EGYPT STAGGER

THE LORD HAS MINGLED WITHIN HER A SPIRIT OF CONFUSION AND THEY WILL MAKE EGYPT STAGGER IN ALL ITS DEEDS AS A DRUNKEN MAN STAGGERS IN HIS VOMIT

AND THERE WILL BE NOTHING FOR EGYPT THAT HEAD OR TAIL PALM BRANCH OR REED MAY DO

IN THAT DAY THE EGYPTIANS WILL BE LIKE WOMEN AND TREMBLE WITH FEAR BEFORE THE HAND THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS SHAKES OVER THEM

AND THE LAND OF JUDAH WILL BECOME A TERROR TO THE EGYPTIANS

EVERYONE TO WHOM IT IS MENTIONED WILL FEAR BECAUSE OF THE PURPOSE THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS PURPOSED AGAINST THEM

IN THAT DAY THERE WILL BE FIVE CITIES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT THAT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF CANAAN AND SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THE LORD OF HOSTS

ONE OF THESE WILL BE CALLED THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION

IN THAT DAY THERE WILL BE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND A PILLAR TO THE LORD AT ITS BORDER

IT WILL BE A SIGN AND A WITNESS TO THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

WHEN THEY CRY TO THE LORD BECAUSE OF OPPRESSORS HE WILL SEND THEM A SAVIOR AND DEFENDER AND DELIVER THEM

AND THE LORD WILL MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE EGYPTIANS AND THE EGYPTIANS WILL KNOW THE LORD IN THAT DAY AND WORSHIP WITH SACRIFICE AND OFFERING AND THEY WILL MAKE VOWS TO THE LORD AND PERFORM THEM

AND THE LORD WILL STRIKE EGYPT STRIKING AND HEALING AND THEY WILL RETURN TO THE LORD AND HE WILL LISTEN TO THEIR PLEAS FOR MERCY AND HEAL THEM

IN THAT DAY THERE WILL BE A HIGHWAY FROM EGYPT TO ASSYRIA AND ASSYRIA WILL COME INTO EGYPT AND EGYPT INTO ASSYRIA AND THE EGYPTIANS WILL WORSHIP WITH THE ASSYRIANS

IN THAT DAY ISRAEL WILL BE THE THIRD WITH EGYPT AND ASSYRIA A BLESSING IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH WHOM THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS BLESSED SAYING BLESSED BE EGYPT MY PEOPLE AND ASSYRIA THE WORK OF MY HANDS AND ISRAEL MY INHERITANCE

IN THE YEAR THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO WAS SENT BY SARGON THE KING OF ASSYRIA CAME TO ASHDOD AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT AND CAPTURED IT AT THAT TIME THE LORD SPOKE BY ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ SAYING GO AND LOOSE THE SACKCLOTH FROM YOUR WAIST AND TAKE OFF YOUR SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET AND HE DID SO WALKING NAKED AND BAREFOOT

THEN THE LORD SAID AS MY SERVANT ISAIAH HAS WALKED NAKED AND BAREFOOT FOR THREE YEARS AS A SIGN AND A PORTENT AGAINST EGYPT AND CUSH SO SHALL THE KING OF ASSYRIA LEAD AWAY THE EGYPTIAN CAPTIVES AND THE CUSHITE EXILES BOTH THE YOUNG AND THE OLD NAKED AND BAREFOOT WITH BUTTOCKS UNCOVERED THE NAKEDNESS OF EGYPT

THEN THEY SHALL BE DISMAYED AND ASHAMED BECAUSE OF CUSH THEIR HOPE AND OF EGYPT THEIR BOAST

AND THE INHABITANTS OF THIS COASTLAND WILL SAY IN THAT DAY 'BEHOLD THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THOSE IN WHOM WE HOPED AND TO WHOM WE FLED FOR HELP TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE KING OF ASSYRIA

AND WE HOW SHALL WE ESCAPE

'THE ORACLE CONCERNING THE WILDERNESS OF THE SEA

AS WHIRLWINDS IN THE NEGEB SWEEP ON IT COMES FROM THE WILDERNESS FROM A TERRIBLE LAND

A STERN VISION IS TOLD TO ME; THE TRAITOR BETRAYS AND THE DESTROYER DESTROYS

GO UP O ELAM; LAY SIEGE O MEDIA; ALL THE SIGHING SHE HAS CAUSED I BRING TO AN END

THEREFORE MY LOINS ARE FILLED WITH ANGUISH; PANGS HAVE SEIZED ME LIKE THE PANGS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR; I AM BOWED DOWN SO THAT I CANNOT HEAR; I AM DISMAYED SO THAT I CANNOT SEE

MY HEART STAGGERS; HORROR HAS APPALLED ME; THE TWILIGHT I LONGED FOR HAS BEEN TURNED FOR ME INTO TREMBLING

THEY PREPARE THE TABLE THEY SPREAD THE RUGS THEY EAT THEY DRINK

ARISE O PRINCES; OIL THE SHIELD

FOR THUS THE LORD SAID TO ME GO SET A WATCHMAN; LET HIM ANNOUNCE WHAT HE SEES

WHEN HE SEES RIDERS HORSEMEN IN PAIRS RIDERS ON DONKEYS RIDERS ON CAMELS LET HIM LISTEN DILIGENTLY VERY DILIGENTLY

 THEN HE WHO SAW CRIED OUT UPON A WATCHTOWER I STAND O LORD CONTINUALLY BY DAY AND AT MY POST I AM STATIONED WHOLE NIGHTS

AND BEHOLD HERE COME RIDERS HORSEMEN IN PAIRS

 AND HE ANSWERED FALLEN FALLEN IS BABYLON; AND ALL THE CARVED IMAGES OF HER GODS HE HAS SHATTERED TO THE GROUND

 O MY THRESHED AND WINNOWED ONE WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL I ANNOUNCE TO YOU

THE ORACLE CONCERNING DUMAH

ONE IS CALLING TO ME FROM SEIR WATCHMAN WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT

WATCHMAN WHAT TIME OF THE NIGHT

 THE WATCHMAN SAYS MORNING COMES AND ALSO THE NIGHT

IF YOU WILL INQUIRE INQUIRE; COME BACK AGAIN

 THE ORACLE CONCERNING ARABIA

IN THE THICKETS IN ARABIA YOU WILL LODGE O CARAVANS OF DEDANITES

TO THE THIRSTY BRING WATER; MEET THE FUGITIVE WITH BREAD O INHABITANTS OF THE LAND OF TEMA

FOR THEY HAVE FLED FROM THE SWORDS FROM THE DRAWN SWORD FROM THE BENT BOW AND FROM THE PRESS OF BATTLE

FOR THUS THE LORD SAID TO ME WITHIN A YEAR ACCORDING TO THE YEARS OF A HIRED WORKER ALL THE GLORY OF KEDAR WILL COME TO AN END

AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARCHERS OF THE MIGHTY MEN OF THE SONS OF KEDAR WILL BE FEW FOR THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SPOKEN

THE ORACLE CONCERNING THE VALLEY OF VISION

WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU HAVE GONE UP ALL OF YOU TO THE HOUSETOPS YOU WHO ARE FULL OF SHOUTINGS TUMULTUOUS CITY EXULTANT TOWN

YOUR SLAIN ARE NOT SLAIN WITH THE SWORD OR DEAD IN BATTLE

ALL YOUR LEADERS HAVE FLED TOGETHER; WITHOUT THE BOW THEY WERE CAPTURED

ALL OF YOU WHO WERE FOUND WERE CAPTURED THOUGH THEY HAD FLED FAR AWAY

THEREFORE I SAID LOOK AWAY FROM ME; LET ME WEEP BITTER TEARS; DO NOT LABOR TO COMFORT ME CONCERNING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE

 FOR THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS HAS A DAY OF TUMULT AND TRAMPLING AND CONFUSION IN THE VALLEY OF VISION A BATTERING DOWN OF WALLS AND A SHOUTING TO THE MOUNTAINS

AND ELAM BORE THE QUIVER WITH CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND KIR UNCOVERED THE SHIELD

YOUR CHOICEST VALLEYS WERE FULL OF CHARIOTS AND THE HORSEMEN TOOK THEIR STAND AT THE GATES

HE HAS TAKEN AWAY THE COVERING OF JUDAH

IN THAT DAY YOU LOOKED TO THE WEAPONS OF THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST AND YOU SAW THAT THE BREACHES OF THE CITY OF DAVID WERE MANY

YOU COLLECTED THE WATERS OF THE LOWER POOL AND YOU COUNTED THE HOUSES OF JERUSALEM AND YOU BROKE DOWN THE HOUSES TO FORTIFY THE WALL

YOU MADE A RESERVOIR BETWEEN THE TWO WALLS FOR THE WATER OF THE OLD POOL

BUT YOU DID NOT LOOK TO HIM WHO DID IT OR SEE HIM WHO PLANNED IT LONG AGO

IN THAT DAY THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS CALLED FOR WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR BALDNESS AND WEARING SACKCLOTH; AND BEHOLD JOY AND GLADNESS KILLING OXEN AND SLAUGHTERING SHEEP EATING FLESH AND DRINKING WINE

LET US EAT AND DRINK FOR TOMORROW WE DIE

 THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS REVEALED HIMSELF IN MY EARS SURELY THIS INIQUITY WILL NOT BE ATONED FOR YOU UNTIL YOU DIE SAYS THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS COME GO TO THIS STEWARD TO SHEBNA WHO IS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SAY TO HIM WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO HERE AND WHOM HAVE YOU HERE THAT YOU HAVE CUT OUT HERE A TOMB FOR YOURSELF YOU WHO CUT OUT A TOMB ON THE HEIGHT AND CARVE A DWELLING FOR YOURSELF IN THE ROCK

BEHOLD THE LORD WILL HURL YOU AWAY VIOLENTLY O YOU STRONG MAN

HE WILL SEIZE FIRM HOLD ON YOU AND WHIRL YOU AROUND AND AROUND AND THROW YOU LIKE A BALL INTO A WIDE LAND

THERE YOU SHALL DIE AND THERE SHALL BE YOUR GLORIOUS CHARIOTS YOU SHAME OF YOUR MASTER'S HOUSE

I WILL THRUST YOU FROM YOUR OFFICE AND YOU WILL BE PULLED DOWN FROM YOUR STATION

IN THAT DAY I WILL CALL MY SERVANT ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH AND I WILL CLOTHE HIM WITH YOUR ROBE AND WILL BIND YOUR SASH ON HIM AND WILL COMMIT YOUR AUTHORITY TO HIS HAND

AND HE SHALL BE A FATHER TO THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND TO THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

AND I WILL PLACE ON HIS SHOULDER THE KEY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID

HE SHALL OPEN AND NONE SHALL SHUT; AND HE SHALL SHUT AND NONE SHALL OPEN

AND I WILL FASTEN HIM LIKE A PEG IN A SECURE PLACE AND HE WILL BECOME A THRONE OF HONOR TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

AND THEY WILL HANG ON HIM THE WHOLE HONOR OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE THE OFFSPRING AND ISSUE EVERY SMALL VESSEL FROM THE CUPS TO ALL THE FLAGONS

IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS THE PEG THAT WAS FASTENED IN A SECURE PLACE WILL GIVE WAY AND IT WILL BE CUT DOWN AND FALL AND THE LOAD THAT WAS ON IT WILL BE CUT OFF FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

THE ORACLE CONCERNING TYRE

WAIL O SHIPS OF TARSHISH FOR TYRE IS LAID WASTE WITHOUT HOUSE OR HARBOR

FROM THE LAND OF CYPRUS IT IS REVEALED TO THEM

BE STILL O INHABITANTS OF THE COAST; THE MERCHANTS OF SIDON WHO CROSS THE SEA HAVE FILLED YOU

AND ON MANY WATERS YOUR REVENUE WAS THE GRAIN OF SHIHOR THE HARVEST OF THE NILE; YOU WERE THE MERCHANT OF THE NATIONS

BE ASHAMED O SIDON FOR THE SEA HAS SPOKEN THE STRONGHOLD OF THE SEA SAYING I HAVE NEITHER LABORED NOR GIVEN BIRTH I HAVE NEITHER REARED YOUNG MEN NOR BROUGHT UP YOUNG WOMEN

 WHEN THE REPORT COMES TO EGYPT THEY WILL BE IN ANGUISH OVER THE REPORT ABOUT TYRE

CROSS OVER TO TARSHISH; WAIL O INHABITANTS OF THE COAST

IS THIS YOUR EXULTANT CITY WHOSE ORIGIN IS FROM DAYS OF OLD WHOSE FEET CARRIED HER TO SETTLE FAR AWAY

WHO HAS PURPOSED THIS AGAINST TYRE THE BESTOWER OF CROWNS WHOSE MERCHANTS WERE PRINCES WHOSE TRADERS WERE THE HONORED OF THE EARTH

THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS PURPOSED IT TO DEFILE THE POMPOUS PRIDE OF ALL GLORY TO DISHONOR ALL THE HONORED OF THE EARTH

CROSS OVER YOUR LAND LIKE THE NILE O DAUGHTER OF TARSHISH; THERE IS NO RESTRAINT ANYMORE

HE HAS STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND OVER THE SEA; HE HAS SHAKEN THE KINGDOMS; THE LORD HAS GIVEN COMMAND CONCERNING CANAAN TO DESTROY ITS STRONGHOLDS

AND HE SAID YOU WILL NO MORE EXULT O OPPRESSED VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF SIDON; ARISE CROSS OVER TO CYPRUS EVEN THERE YOU WILL HAVE NO REST

 BEHOLD THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS

THIS IS THE PEOPLE THAT WAS NOT; ASSYRIA DESTINED IT FOR WILD BEASTS

THEY ERECTED THEIR SIEGE TOWERS THEY STRIPPED HER PALACES BARE THEY MADE HER A RUIN

WAIL O SHIPS OF TARSHISH FOR YOUR STRONGHOLD IS LAID WASTE

IN THAT DAY TYRE WILL BE FORGOTTEN FOR SEVENTY YEARS LIKE THE DAYS OF ONE KING

AT THE END OF SEVENTY YEARS IT WILL HAPPEN TO TYRE AS IN THE SONG OF THE PROSTITUTE TAKE A HARP; GO ABOUT THE CITY O FORGOTTEN PROSTITUTE

MAKE SWEET MELODY; SING MANY SONGS THAT YOU MAY BE REMEMBERED

 AT THE END OF SEVENTY YEARS THE LORD WILL VISIT TYRE AND SHE WILL RETURN TO HER WAGES AND WILL PROSTITUTE HERSELF WITH ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

HER MERCHANDISE AND HER WAGES WILL BE HOLY TO THE LORD

IT WILL NOT BE STORED OR HOARDED BUT HER MERCHANDISE WILL SUPPLY ABUNDANT FOOD AND FINE CLOTHING FOR THOSE WHO DWELL BEFORE THE LORD

BEHOLD THE LORD WILL EMPTY THE EARTH AND MAKE IT DESOLATE AND HE WILL TWIST ITS SURFACE AND SCATTER ITS INHABITANTS

AND IT SHALL BE AS WITH THE PEOPLE SO WITH THE PRIEST; AS WITH THE SLAVE SO WITH HIS MASTER; AS WITH THE MAID SO WITH HER MISTRESS; AS WITH THE BUYER SO WITH THE SELLER; AS WITH THE LENDER SO WITH THE BORROWER; AS WITH THE CREDITOR SO WITH THE DEBTOR

THE EARTH SHALL BE UTTERLY EMPTY AND UTTERLY PLUNDERED; FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN THIS WORD

THE EARTH MOURNS AND WITHERS; THE WORLD LANGUISHES AND WITHERS; THE HIGHEST PEOPLE OF THE EARTH LANGUISH

THE EARTH LIES DEFILED UNDER ITS INHABITANTS; FOR THEY HAVE TRANSGRESSED THE LAWS VIOLATED THE STATUTES BROKEN THE EVERLASTING COVENANT

THEREFORE A CURSE DEVOURS THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS SUFFER FOR THEIR GUILT; THEREFORE THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE SCORCHED AND FEW MEN ARE LEFT

THE WINE MOURNS THE VINE LANGUISHES ALL THE MERRYHEARTED SIGH

THE MIRTH OF THE TAMBOURINES IS STILLED THE NOISE OF THE JUBILANT HAS CEASED THE MIRTH OF THE LYRE IS STILLED

NO MORE DO THEY DRINK WINE WITH SINGING; STRONG DRINK IS BITTER TO THOSE WHO DRINK IT

THE WASTED CITY IS BROKEN DOWN; EVERY HOUSE IS SHUT UP SO THAT NONE CAN ENTER

THERE IS AN OUTCRY IN THE STREETS FOR LACK OF WINE; ALL JOY HAS GROWN DARK; THE GLADNESS OF THE EARTH IS BANISHED

DESOLATION IS LEFT IN THE CITY; THE GATES ARE BATTERED INTO RUINS

FOR THUS IT SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH AMONG THE NATIONS AS WHEN AN OLIVE TREE IS BEATEN AS AT THE GLEANING WHEN THE GRAPE HARVEST IS DONE

THEY LIFT UP THEIR VOICES THEY SING FOR JOY; OVER THE MAJESTY OF THE LORD THEY SHOUT FROM THE WEST

THEREFORE IN THE EAST GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD; IN THE COASTLANDS OF THE SEA GIVE GLORY TO THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH WE HEAR SONGS OF PRAISE OF GLORY TO THE RIGHTEOUS ONE

BUT I SAY I WASTE AWAY I WASTE AWAY

WOE IS ME

FOR THE TRAITORS HAVE BETRAYED WITH BETRAYAL THE TRAITORS HAVE BETRAYED

 TERROR AND THE PIT AND THE SNARE ARE UPON YOU O INHABITANT OF THE EARTH

HE WHO FLEES AT THE SOUND OF THE TERROR SHALL FALL INTO THE PIT AND HE WHO CLIMBS OUT OF THE PIT SHALL BE CAUGHT IN THE SNARE

FOR THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN ARE OPENED AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH TREMBLE

THE EARTH IS UTTERLY BROKEN THE EARTH IS SPLIT APART THE EARTH IS VIOLENTLY SHAKEN

THE EARTH STAGGERS LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN; IT SWAYS LIKE A HUT; ITS TRANSGRESSION LIES HEAVY UPON IT AND IT FALLS AND WILL NOT RISE AGAIN

ON THAT DAY THE LORD WILL PUNISH THE HOST OF HEAVEN IN HEAVEN AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH ON THE EARTH

THEY WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER AS PRISONERS IN A PIT; THEY WILL BE SHUT UP IN A PRISON AND AFTER MANY DAYS THEY WILL BE PUNISHED

THEN THE MOON WILL BE CONFOUNDED AND THE SUN ASHAMED FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS REIGNS ON MOUNT ZION AND IN JERUSALEM AND HIS GLORY WILL BE BEFORE HIS ELDERS

O LORD YOU ARE MY GOD; I WILL EXALT YOU; I WILL PRAISE YOUR NAME FOR YOU HAVE DONE WONDERFUL THINGS PLANS FORMED OF OLD FAITHFUL AND SURE

FOR YOU HAVE MADE THE CITY A HEAP THE FORTIFIED CITY A RUIN; THE FOREIGNERS' PALACE IS A CITY NO MORE; IT WILL NEVER BE REBUILT

THEREFORE STRONG PEOPLES WILL GLORIFY YOU; CITIES OF RUTHLESS NATIONS WILL FEAR YOU

FOR YOU HAVE BEEN A STRONGHOLD TO THE POOR A STRONGHOLD TO THE NEEDY IN HIS DISTRESS A SHELTER FROM THE STORM AND A SHADE FROM THE HEAT; FOR THE BREATH OF THE RUTHLESS IS LIKE A STORM AGAINST A WALL LIKE HEAT IN A DRY PLACE

YOU SUBDUE THE NOISE OF THE FOREIGNERS; AS HEAT BY THE SHADE OF A CLOUD SO THE SONG OF THE RUTHLESS IS PUT DOWN

ON THIS MOUNTAIN THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL MAKE FOR ALL PEOPLES A FEAST OF RICH FOOD A FEAST OF WELLAGED WINE OF RICH FOOD FULL OF MARROW OF AGED WINE WELL REFINED

AND HE WILL SWALLOW UP ON THIS MOUNTAIN THE COVERING THAT IS CAST OVER ALL PEOPLES THE VEIL THAT IS SPREAD OVER ALL NATIONS

HE WILL SWALLOW UP DEATH FOREVER; AND THE LORD GOD WILL WIPE AWAY TEARS FROM ALL FACES AND THE REPROACH OF HIS PEOPLE HE WILL TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THE EARTH FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

IT WILL BE SAID ON THAT DAY BEHOLD THIS IS OUR GOD; WE HAVE WAITED FOR HIM THAT HE MIGHT SAVE US

THIS IS THE LORD; WE HAVE WAITED FOR HIM; LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE IN HIS SALVATION

 FOR THE HAND OF THE LORD WILL REST ON THIS MOUNTAIN AND MOAB SHALL BE TRAMPLED DOWN IN HIS PLACE AS STRAW IS TRAMPLED DOWN IN A DUNGHILL

AND HE WILL SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS IN THE MIDST OF IT AS A SWIMMER SPREADS HIS HANDS OUT TO SWIM BUT THE LORD WILL LAY LOW HIS POMPOUS PRIDE TOGETHER WITH THE SKILL OF HIS HANDS

AND THE HIGH FORTIFICATIONS OF HIS WALLS HE WILL BRING DOWN LAY LOW AND CAST TO THE GROUND TO THE DUST

IN THAT DAY THIS SONG WILL BE SUNG IN THE LAND OF JUDAH WE HAVE A STRONG CITY; HE SETS UP SALVATION AS WALLS AND BULWARKS

OPEN THE GATES THAT THE RIGHTEOUS NATION THAT KEEPS FAITH MAY ENTER IN

YOU KEEP HIM IN PERFECT PEACE WHOSE MIND IS STAYED ON YOU BECAUSE HE TRUSTS IN YOU

TRUST IN THE LORD FOREVER FOR THE LORD GOD IS AN EVERLASTING ROCK

FOR HE HAS HUMBLED THE INHABITANTS OF THE HEIGHT THE LOFTY CITY

HE LAYS IT LOW LAYS IT LOW TO THE GROUND CASTS IT TO THE DUST

THE FOOT TRAMPLES IT THE FEET OF THE POOR THE STEPS OF THE NEEDY

 THE PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS LEVEL; YOU MAKE LEVEL THE WAY OF THE RIGHTEOUS

IN THE PATH OF YOUR JUDGMENTS O LORD WE WAIT FOR YOU; YOUR NAME AND REMEMBRANCE ARE THE DESIRE OF OUR SOUL

MY SOUL YEARNS FOR YOU IN THE NIGHT; MY SPIRIT WITHIN ME EARNESTLY SEEKS YOU

FOR WHEN YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE IN THE EARTH THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS

IF FAVOR IS SHOWN TO THE WICKED HE DOES NOT LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS; IN THE LAND OF UPRIGHTNESS HE DEALS CORRUPTLY AND DOES NOT SEE THE MAJESTY OF THE LORD

O LORD YOUR HAND IS LIFTED UP BUT THEY DO NOT SEE IT

LET THEM SEE YOUR ZEAL FOR YOUR PEOPLE AND BE ASHAMED

LET THE FIRE FOR YOUR ADVERSARIES CONSUME THEM

O LORD YOU WILL ORDAIN PEACE FOR US; YOU HAVE DONE FOR US ALL OUR WORKS

O LORD OUR GOD OTHER LORDS BESIDES YOU HAVE RULED OVER US BUT YOUR NAME ALONE WE BRING TO REMEMBRANCE

THEY ARE DEAD THEY WILL NOT LIVE; THEY ARE SHADES THEY WILL NOT ARISE; TO THAT END YOU HAVE VISITED THEM WITH DESTRUCTION AND WIPED OUT ALL REMEMBRANCE OF THEM

BUT YOU HAVE INCREASED THE NATION O LORD YOU HAVE INCREASED THE NATION; YOU ARE GLORIFIED; YOU HAVE ENLARGED ALL THE BORDERS OF THE LAND

O LORD IN DISTRESS THEY SOUGHT YOU; THEY POURED OUT A WHISPERED PRAYER WHEN YOUR DISCIPLINE WAS UPON THEM

LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WRITHES AND CRIES OUT IN HER PANGS WHEN SHE IS NEAR TO GIVING BIRTH SO WERE WE BECAUSE OF YOU O LORD; WE WERE PREGNANT WE WRITHED BUT WE HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO WIND

WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED NO DELIVERANCE IN THE EARTH AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD HAVE NOT FALLEN

YOUR DEAD SHALL LIVE; THEIR BODIES SHALL RISE

YOU WHO DWELL IN THE DUST AWAKE AND SING FOR JOY

FOR YOUR DEW IS A DEW OF LIGHT AND THE EARTH WILL GIVE BIRTH TO THE DEAD

COME MY PEOPLE ENTER YOUR CHAMBERS AND SHUT YOUR DOORS BEHIND YOU; HIDE YOURSELVES FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL THE FURY HAS PASSED BY

FOR BEHOLD THE LORD IS COMING OUT FROM HIS PLACE TO PUNISH THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH FOR THEIR INIQUITY AND THE EARTH WILL DISCLOSE THE BLOOD SHED ON IT AND WILL NO MORE COVER ITS SLAIN

IN THAT DAY THE LORD WITH HIS HARD AND GREAT AND STRONG SWORD WILL PUNISH LEVIATHAN THE FLEEING SERPENT LEVIATHAN THE TWISTING SERPENT AND HE WILL SLAY THE DRAGON THAT IS IN THE SEA

IN THAT DAY A PLEASANT VINEYARD SING OF IT

I THE LORD AM ITS KEEPER; EVERY MOMENT I WATER IT

LEST ANYONE PUNISH IT I KEEP IT NIGHT AND DAY; I HAVE NO WRATH

WOULD THAT I HAD THORNS AND BRIERS TO BATTLE

I WOULD MARCH AGAINST THEM I WOULD BURN THEM UP TOGETHER

OR LET THEM LAY HOLD OF MY PROTECTION LET THEM MAKE PEACE WITH ME LET THEM MAKE PEACE WITH ME

 IN DAYS TO COME JACOB SHALL TAKE ROOT ISRAEL SHALL BLOSSOM AND PUT FORTH SHOOTS AND FILL THE WHOLE WORLD WITH FRUIT

HAS HE STRUCK THEM AS HE STRUCK THOSE WHO STRUCK THEM

OR HAVE THEY BEEN SLAIN AS THEIR SLAYERS WERE SLAIN

MEASURE BY MEASURE BY EXILE YOU CONTENDED WITH THEM; HE REMOVED THEM WITH HIS FIERCE BREATH IN THE DAY OF THE EAST WIND

THEREFORE BY THIS THE GUILT OF JACOB WILL BE ATONED FOR AND THIS WILL BE THE FULL FRUIT OF THE REMOVAL OF HIS SIN WHEN HE MAKES ALL THE STONES OF THE ALTARS LIKE CHALKSTONES CRUSHED TO PIECES NO ASHERIM OR INCENSE ALTARS WILL REMAIN STANDING

FOR THE FORTIFIED CITY IS SOLITARY A HABITATION DESERTED AND FORSAKEN LIKE THE WILDERNESS; THERE THE CALF GRAZES; THERE IT LIES DOWN AND STRIPS ITS BRANCHES

WHEN ITS BOUGHS ARE DRY THEY ARE BROKEN; WOMEN COME AND MAKE A FIRE OF THEM

FOR THIS IS A PEOPLE WITHOUT DISCERNMENT; THEREFORE HE WHO MADE THEM WILL NOT HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM; HE WHO FORMED THEM WILL SHOW THEM NO FAVOR

IN THAT DAY FROM THE RIVER EUPHRATES TO THE BROOK OF EGYPT THE LORD WILL THRESH OUT THE GRAIN AND YOU WILL BE GLEANED ONE BY ONE O PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND IN THAT DAY A GREAT TRUMPET WILL BE BLOWN AND THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN THE LAND OF ASSYRIA AND THOSE WHO WERE DRIVEN OUT TO THE LAND OF EGYPT WILL COME AND WORSHIP THE LORD ON THE HOLY MOUNTAIN AT JERUSALEM

AH THE PROUD CROWN OF THE DRUNKARDS OF EPHRAIM AND THE FADING FLOWER OF ITS GLORIOUS BEAUTY WHICH IS ON THE HEAD OF THE RICH VALLEY OF THOSE OVERCOME WITH WINE

BEHOLD THE LORD HAS ONE WHO IS MIGHTY AND STRONG; LIKE A STORM OF HAIL A DESTROYING TEMPEST LIKE A STORM OF MIGHTY OVERFLOWING WATERS HE CASTS DOWN TO THE EARTH WITH HIS HAND

THE PROUD CROWN OF THE DRUNKARDS OF EPHRAIM WILL BE TRODDEN UNDERFOOT; AND THE FADING FLOWER OF ITS GLORIOUS BEAUTY WHICH IS ON THE HEAD OF THE RICH VALLEY WILL BE LIKE A FIRSTRIPE FIG BEFORE THE SUMMER WHEN SOMEONE SEES IT HE SWALLOWS IT AS SOON AS IT IS IN HIS HAND

IN THAT DAY THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL BE A CROWN OF GLORY AND A DIADEM OF BEAUTY TO THE REMNANT OF HIS PEOPLE AND A SPIRIT OF JUSTICE TO HIM WHO SITS IN JUDGMENT AND STRENGTH TO THOSE WHO TURN BACK THE BATTLE AT THE GATE

THESE ALSO REEL WITH WINE AND STAGGER WITH STRONG DRINK; THE PRIEST AND THE PROPHET REEL WITH STRONG DRINK THEY ARE SWALLOWED BY WINE THEY STAGGER WITH STRONG DRINK THEY REEL IN VISION THEY STUMBLE IN GIVING JUDGMENT

FOR ALL TABLES ARE FULL OF FILTHY VOMIT WITH NO SPACE LEFT

TO WHOM WILL HE TEACH KNOWLEDGE AND TO WHOM WILL HE EXPLAIN THE MESSAGE

THOSE WHO ARE WEANED FROM THE MILK THOSE TAKEN FROM THE BREAST

FOR IT IS PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT LINE UPON LINE LINE UPON LINE HERE A LITTLE THERE A LITTLE

 FOR BY PEOPLE OF STRANGE LIPS AND WITH A FOREIGN TONGUE THE LORD WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE TO WHOM HE HAS SAID THIS IS REST; GIVE REST TO THE WEARY; AND THIS IS REPOSE; YET THEY WOULD NOT HEAR

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD WILL BE TO THEM PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT LINE UPON LINE LINE UPON LINE HERE A LITTLE THERE A LITTLE THAT THEY MAY GO AND FALL BACKWARD AND BE BROKEN AND SNARED AND TAKEN

THEREFORE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD YOU SCOFFERS WHO RULE THIS PEOPLE IN JERUSALEM

BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID WE HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH DEATH AND WITH SHEOL WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WHEN THE OVERWHELMING WHIP PASSES THROUGH IT WILL NOT COME TO US FOR WE HAVE MADE LIES OUR REFUGE AND IN FALSEHOOD WE HAVE TAKEN SHELTER; THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I AM THE ONE WHO HAS LAID AS A FOUNDATION IN ZION A STONE A TESTED STONE A PRECIOUS CORNERSTONE OF A SURE FOUNDATION 'WHOEVER BELIEVES WILL NOT BE IN HASTE

' AND I WILL MAKE JUSTICE THE LINE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PLUMB LINE; AND HAIL WILL SWEEP AWAY THE REFUGE OF LIES AND WATERS WILL OVERWHELM THE SHELTER

 THEN YOUR COVENANT WITH DEATH WILL BE ANNULLED AND YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SHEOL WILL NOT STAND; WHEN THE OVERWHELMING SCOURGE PASSES THROUGH YOU WILL BE BEATEN DOWN BY IT

AS OFTEN AS IT PASSES THROUGH IT WILL TAKE YOU; FOR MORNING BY MORNING IT WILL PASS THROUGH BY DAY AND BY NIGHT; AND IT WILL BE SHEER TERROR TO UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE

FOR THE BED IS TOO SHORT TO STRETCH ONESELF ON AND THE COVERING TOO NARROW TO WRAP ONESELF IN

FOR THE LORD WILL RISE UP AS ON MOUNT PERAZIM; AS IN THE VALLEY OF GIBEON HE WILL BE ROUSED; TO DO HIS DEEDSTRANGE IS HIS DEED

AND TO WORK HIS WORKALIEN IS HIS WORK

NOW THEREFORE DO NOT SCOFF LEST YOUR BONDS BE MADE STRONG; FOR I HAVE HEARD A DECREE OF DESTRUCTION FROM THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS AGAINST THE WHOLE LAND

GIVE EAR AND HEAR MY VOICE; GIVE ATTENTION AND HEAR MY SPEECH

DOES HE WHO PLOWS FOR SOWING PLOW CONTINUALLY

DOES HE CONTINUALLY OPEN AND HARROW HIS GROUND

WHEN HE HAS LEVELED ITS SURFACE DOES HE NOT SCATTER DILL SOW CUMIN AND PUT IN WHEAT IN ROWS AND BARLEY IN ITS PROPER PLACE AND EMMER AS THE BORDER

FOR HE IS RIGHTLY INSTRUCTED; HIS GOD TEACHES HIM

DILL IS NOT THRESHED WITH A THRESHING SLEDGE NOR IS A CART WHEEL ROLLED OVER CUMIN BUT DILL IS BEATEN OUT WITH A STICK AND CUMIN WITH A ROD

DOES ONE CRUSH GRAIN FOR BREAD

NO HE DOES NOT THRESH IT FOREVER; WHEN HE DRIVES HIS CART WHEEL OVER IT WITH HIS HORSES HE DOES NOT CRUSH IT

THIS ALSO COMES FROM THE LORD OF HOSTS; HE IS WONDERFUL IN COUNSEL AND EXCELLENT IN WISDOM

AH ARIEL ARIEL THE CITY WHERE DAVID ENCAMPED

ADD YEAR TO YEAR; LET THE FEASTS RUN THEIR ROUND

YET I WILL DISTRESS ARIEL AND THERE SHALL BE MOANING AND LAMENTATION AND SHE SHALL BE TO ME LIKE AN ARIEL

AND I WILL ENCAMP AGAINST YOU ALL AROUND AND WILL BESIEGE YOU WITH TOWERS AND I WILL RAISE SIEGEWORKS AGAINST YOU

AND YOU WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; FROM THE EARTH YOU SHALL SPEAK AND FROM THE DUST YOUR SPEECH WILL BE BOWED DOWN; YOUR VOICE SHALL COME FROM THE GROUND LIKE THE VOICE OF A GHOST AND FROM THE DUST YOUR SPEECH SHALL WHISPER

BUT THE MULTITUDE OF YOUR FOREIGN FOES SHALL BE LIKE SMALL DUST AND THE MULTITUDE OF THE RUTHLESS LIKE PASSING CHAFF

AND IN AN INSTANT SUDDENLY YOU WILL BE VISITED BY THE LORD OF HOSTS WITH THUNDER AND WITH EARTHQUAKE AND GREAT NOISE WITH WHIRLWIND AND TEMPEST AND THE FLAME OF A DEVOURING FIRE

AND THE MULTITUDE OF ALL THE NATIONS THAT FIGHT AGAINST ARIEL ALL THAT FIGHT AGAINST HER AND HER STRONGHOLD AND DISTRESS HER SHALL BE LIKE A DREAM A VISION OF THE NIGHT

AS WHEN A HUNGRY MAN DREAMS HE IS EATING AND AWAKES WITH HIS HUNGER NOT SATISFIED OR AS WHEN A THIRSTY MAN DREAMS HE IS DRINKING AND AWAKES FAINT WITH HIS THIRST NOT QUENCHED SO SHALL THE MULTITUDE OF ALL THE NATIONS BE THAT FIGHT AGAINST MOUNT ZION

ASTONISH YOURSELVES AND BE ASTONISHED; BLIND YOURSELVES AND BE BLIND

BE DRUNK BUT NOT WITH WINE; STAGGER BUT NOT WITH STRONG DRINK

FOR THE LORD HAS POURED OUT UPON YOU A SPIRIT OF DEEP SLEEP AND HAS CLOSED YOUR EYES THE PROPHETS AND COVERED YOUR HEADS THE SEERS

AND THE VISION OF ALL THIS HAS BECOME TO YOU LIKE THE WORDS OF A BOOK THAT IS SEALED

WHEN MEN GIVE IT TO ONE WHO CAN READ SAYING READ THIS HE SAYS I CANNOT FOR IT IS SEALED

 AND WHEN THEY GIVE THE BOOK TO ONE WHO CANNOT READ SAYING READ THIS HE SAYS I CANNOT READ

 AND THE LORD SAID BECAUSE THIS PEOPLE DRAW NEAR WITH THEIR MOUTH AND HONOR ME WITH THEIR LIPS WHILE THEIR HEARTS ARE FAR FROM ME AND THEIR FEAR OF ME IS A COMMANDMENT TAUGHT BY MEN THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL AGAIN DO WONDERFUL THINGS WITH THIS PEOPLE WITH WONDER UPON WONDER; AND THE WISDOM OF THEIR WISE MEN SHALL PERISH AND THE DISCERNMENT OF THEIR DISCERNING MEN SHALL BE HIDDEN

 AH YOU WHO HIDE DEEP FROM THE LORD YOUR COUNSEL WHOSE DEEDS ARE IN THE DARK AND WHO SAY WHO SEES US

WHO KNOWS US

 YOU TURN THINGS UPSIDE DOWN

SHALL THE POTTER BE REGARDED AS THE CLAY THAT THE THING MADE SHOULD SAY OF ITS MAKER HE DID NOT MAKE ME; OR THE THING FORMED SAY OF HIM WHO FORMED IT HE HAS NO UNDERSTANDING

IS IT NOT YET A VERY LITTLE WHILE UNTIL LEBANON SHALL BE TURNED INTO A FRUITFUL FIELD AND THE FRUITFUL FIELD SHALL BE REGARDED AS A FOREST

IN THAT DAY THE DEAF SHALL HEAR THE WORDS OF A BOOK AND OUT OF THEIR GLOOM AND DARKNESS THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL SEE

THE MEEK SHALL OBTAIN FRESH JOY IN THE LORD AND THE POOR AMONG MANKIND SHALL EXULT IN THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

FOR THE RUTHLESS SHALL COME TO NOTHING AND THE SCOFFER CEASE AND ALL WHO WATCH TO DO EVIL SHALL BE CUT OFF WHO BY A WORD MAKE A MAN OUT TO BE AN OFFENDER AND LAY A SNARE FOR HIM WHO REPROVES IN THE GATE AND WITH AN EMPTY PLEA TURN ASIDE HIM WHO IS IN THE RIGHT

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO REDEEMED ABRAHAM CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF JACOB JACOB SHALL NO MORE BE ASHAMED NO MORE SHALL HIS FACE GROW PALE

FOR WHEN HE SEES HIS CHILDREN THE WORK OF MY HANDS IN HIS MIDST THEY WILL SANCTIFY MY NAME; THEY WILL SANCTIFY THE HOLY ONE OF JACOB AND WILL STAND IN AWE OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL

AND THOSE WHO GO ASTRAY IN SPIRIT WILL COME TO UNDERSTANDING AND THOSE WHO MURMUR WILL ACCEPT INSTRUCTION

AH STUBBORN CHILDREN DECLARES THE LORD WHO CARRY OUT A PLAN BUT NOT MINE AND WHO MAKE AN ALLIANCE BUT NOT OF MY SPIRIT THAT THEY MAY ADD SIN TO SIN; WHO SET OUT TO GO DOWN TO EGYPT WITHOUT ASKING FOR MY DIRECTION TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE PROTECTION OF PHARAOH AND TO SEEK SHELTER IN THE SHADOW OF EGYPT

THEREFORE SHALL THE PROTECTION OF PHARAOH TURN TO YOUR SHAME AND THE SHELTER IN THE SHADOW OF EGYPT TO YOUR HUMILIATION

FOR THOUGH HIS OFFICIALS ARE AT ZOAN AND HIS ENVOYS REACH HANES EVERYONE COMES TO SHAME THROUGH A PEOPLE THAT CANNOT PROFIT THEM THAT BRINGS NEITHER HELP NOR PROFIT BUT SHAME AND DISGRACE

 AN ORACLE ON THE BEASTS OF THE NEGEB

THROUGH A LAND OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH FROM WHERE COME THE LIONESS AND THE LION THE ADDER AND THE FLYING FIERY SERPENT THEY CARRY THEIR RICHES ON THE BACKS OF DONKEYS AND THEIR TREASURES ON THE HUMPS OF CAMELS TO A PEOPLE THAT CANNOT PROFIT THEM

EGYPT'S HELP IS WORTHLESS AND EMPTY; THEREFORE I HAVE CALLED HER RAHAB WHO SITS STILL

 AND NOW GO WRITE IT BEFORE THEM ON A TABLET AND INSCRIBE IT IN A BOOK THAT IT MAY BE FOR THE TIME TO COME AS A WITNESS FOREVER

FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS PEOPLE LYING CHILDREN CHILDREN UNWILLING TO HEAR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE LORD; WHO SAY TO THE SEERS DO NOT SEE AND TO THE PROPHETS DO NOT PROPHESY TO US WHAT IS RIGHT; SPEAK TO US SMOOTH THINGS PROPHESY ILLUSIONS LEAVE THE WAY TURN ASIDE FROM THE PATH LET US HEAR NO MORE ABOUT THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE YOU DESPISE THIS WORD AND TRUST IN OPPRESSION AND PERVERSENESS AND RELY ON THEM THEREFORE THIS INIQUITY SHALL BE TO YOU LIKE A BREACH IN A HIGH WALL BULGING OUT AND ABOUT TO COLLAPSE WHOSE BREAKING COMES SUDDENLY IN AN INSTANT; AND ITS BREAKING IS LIKE THAT OF A POTTER'S VESSEL THAT IS SMASHED SO RUTHLESSLY THAT AMONG ITS FRAGMENTS NOT A SHARD IS FOUND WITH WHICH TO TAKE FIRE FROM THE HEARTH OR TO DIP UP WATER OUT OF THE CISTERN

 FOR THUS SAID THE LORD GOD THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL IN RETURNING AND REST YOU SHALL BE SAVED; IN QUIETNESS AND IN TRUST SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH

 BUT YOU WERE UNWILLING AND YOU SAID NO

WE WILL FLEE UPON HORSES; THEREFORE YOU SHALL FLEE AWAY; AND WE WILL RIDE UPON SWIFT STEEDS; THEREFORE YOUR PURSUERS SHALL BE SWIFT

A THOUSAND SHALL FLEE AT THE THREAT OF ONE; AT THE THREAT OF FIVE YOU SHALL FLEE TILL YOU ARE LEFT LIKE A FLAGSTAFF ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN LIKE A SIGNAL ON A HILL

THEREFORE THE LORD WAITS TO BE GRACIOUS TO YOU AND THEREFORE HE EXALTS HIMSELF TO SHOW MERCY TO YOU

FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE; BLESSED ARE ALL THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIM

FOR A PEOPLE SHALL DWELL IN ZION IN JERUSALEM; YOU SHALL WEEP NO MORE

HE WILL SURELY BE GRACIOUS TO YOU AT THE SOUND OF YOUR CRY

AS SOON AS HE HEARS IT HE ANSWERS YOU

AND THOUGH THE LORD GIVE YOU THE BREAD OF ADVERSITY AND THE WATER OF AFFLICTION YET YOUR TEACHER WILL NOT HIDE HIMSELF ANYMORE BUT YOUR EYES SHALL SEE YOUR TEACHER

AND YOUR EARS SHALL HEAR A WORD BEHIND YOU SAYING THIS IS THE WAY WALK IN IT WHEN YOU TURN TO THE RIGHT OR WHEN YOU TURN TO THE LEFT

THEN YOU WILL DEFILE YOUR CARVED IDOLS OVERLAID WITH SILVER AND YOUR GOLDPLATED METAL IMAGES

YOU WILL SCATTER THEM AS UNCLEAN THINGS

YOU WILL SAY TO THEM BE GONE

 AND HE WILL GIVE RAIN FOR THE SEED WITH WHICH YOU SOW THE GROUND AND BREAD THE PRODUCE OF THE GROUND WHICH WILL BE RICH AND PLENTEOUS

IN THAT DAY YOUR LIVESTOCK WILL GRAZE IN LARGE PASTURES AND THE OXEN AND THE DONKEYS THAT WORK THE GROUND WILL EAT SEASONED FODDER WHICH HAS BEEN WINNOWED WITH SHOVEL AND FORK

AND ON EVERY LOFTY MOUNTAIN AND EVERY HIGH HILL THERE WILL BE BROOKS RUNNING WITH WATER IN THE DAY OF THE GREAT SLAUGHTER WHEN THE TOWERS FALL

MOREOVER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON WILL BE AS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AND THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WILL BE SEVENFOLD AS THE LIGHT OF SEVEN DAYS IN THE DAY WHEN THE LORD BINDS UP THE BROKENNESS OF HIS PEOPLE AND HEALS THE WOUNDS INFLICTED BY HIS BLOW

BEHOLD THE NAME OF THE LORD COMES FROM AFAR BURNING WITH HIS ANGER AND IN THICK RISING SMOKE; HIS LIPS ARE FULL OF FURY AND HIS TONGUE IS LIKE A DEVOURING FIRE; HIS BREATH IS LIKE AN OVERFLOWING STREAM THAT REACHES UP TO THE NECK; TO SIFT THE NATIONS WITH THE SIEVE OF DESTRUCTION AND TO PLACE ON THE JAWS OF THE PEOPLES A BRIDLE THAT LEADS ASTRAY

YOU SHALL HAVE A SONG AS IN THE NIGHT WHEN A HOLY FEAST IS KEPT AND GLADNESS OF HEART AS WHEN ONE SETS OUT TO THE SOUND OF THE FLUTE TO GO TO THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD TO THE ROCK OF ISRAEL

AND THE LORD WILL CAUSE HIS MAJESTIC VOICE TO BE HEARD AND THE DESCENDING BLOW OF HIS ARM TO BE SEEN IN FURIOUS ANGER AND A FLAME OF DEVOURING FIRE WITH A CLOUDBURST AND STORM AND HAILSTONES

THE ASSYRIANS WILL BE TERRORSTRICKEN AT THE VOICE OF THE LORD WHEN HE STRIKES WITH HIS ROD

AND EVERY STROKE OF THE APPOINTED STAFF THAT THE LORD LAYS ON THEM WILL BE TO THE SOUND OF TAMBOURINES AND LYRES

BATTLING WITH BRANDISHED ARM HE WILL FIGHT WITH THEM

FOR A BURNING PLACE HAS LONG BEEN PREPARED; INDEED FOR THE KING IT IS MADE READY ITS PYRE MADE DEEP AND WIDE WITH FIRE AND WOOD IN ABUNDANCE; THE BREATH OF THE LORD LIKE A STREAM OF SULFUR KINDLES IT

WOE TO THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO EGYPT FOR HELP AND RELY ON HORSES WHO TRUST IN CHARIOTS BECAUSE THEY ARE MANY AND IN HORSEMEN BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY STRONG BUT DO NOT LOOK TO THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL OR CONSULT THE LORD

AND YET HE IS WISE AND BRINGS DISASTER; HE DOES NOT CALL BACK HIS WORDS BUT WILL ARISE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF THE EVILDOERS AND AGAINST THE HELPERS OF THOSE WHO WORK INIQUITY

THE EGYPTIANS ARE MAN AND NOT GOD AND THEIR HORSES ARE FLESH AND NOT SPIRIT

WHEN THE LORD STRETCHES OUT HIS HAND THE HELPER WILL STUMBLE AND HE WHO IS HELPED WILL FALL AND THEY WILL ALL PERISH TOGETHER

FOR THUS THE LORD SAID TO ME AS A LION OR A YOUNG LION GROWLS OVER HIS PREY AND WHEN A BAND OF SHEPHERDS IS CALLED OUT AGAINST HIM IS NOT TERRIFIED BY THEIR SHOUTING OR DAUNTED AT THEIR NOISE SO THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL COME DOWN TO FIGHT ON MOUNT ZION AND ON ITS HILL

LIKE BIRDS HOVERING SO THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PROTECT JERUSALEM; HE WILL PROTECT AND DELIVER IT; HE WILL SPARE AND RESCUE IT

 TURN TO HIM FROM WHOM PEOPLE HAVE DEEPLY REVOLTED O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL

FOR IN THAT DAY EVERYONE SHALL CAST AWAY HIS IDOLS OF SILVER AND HIS IDOLS OF GOLD WHICH YOUR HANDS HAVE SINFULLY MADE FOR YOU

AND THE ASSYRIAN SHALL FALL BY A SWORD NOT OF MAN; AND A SWORD NOT OF MAN SHALL DEVOUR HIM; AND HE SHALL FLEE FROM THE SWORD AND HIS YOUNG MEN SHALL BE PUT TO FORCED LABOR

HIS ROCK SHALL PASS AWAY IN TERROR AND HIS OFFICERS DESERT THE STANDARD IN PANIC DECLARES THE LORD WHOSE FIRE IS IN ZION AND WHOSE FURNACE IS IN JERUSALEM

BEHOLD A KING WILL REIGN IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PRINCES WILL RULE IN JUSTICE

EACH WILL BE LIKE A HIDING PLACE FROM THE WIND A SHELTER FROM THE STORM LIKE STREAMS OF WATER IN A DRY PLACE LIKE THE SHADE OF A GREAT ROCK IN A WEARY LAND

THEN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SEE WILL NOT BE CLOSED AND THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEAR WILL GIVE ATTENTION

THE HEART OF THE HASTY WILL UNDERSTAND AND KNOW AND THE TONGUE OF THE STAMMERERS WILL HASTEN TO SPEAK DISTINCTLY

THE FOOL WILL NO MORE BE CALLED NOBLE NOR THE SCOUNDREL SAID TO BE HONORABLE

FOR THE FOOL SPEAKS FOLLY AND HIS HEART IS BUSY WITH INIQUITY TO PRACTICE UNGODLINESS TO UTTER ERROR CONCERNING THE LORD TO LEAVE THE CRAVING OF THE HUNGRY UNSATISFIED AND TO DEPRIVE THE THIRSTY OF DRINK

AS FOR THE SCOUNDRELHIS DEVICES ARE EVIL; HE PLANS WICKED SCHEMES TO RUIN THE POOR WITH LYING WORDS EVEN WHEN THE PLEA OF THE NEEDY IS RIGHT

BUT HE WHO IS NOBLE PLANS NOBLE THINGS AND ON NOBLE THINGS HE STANDS

RISE UP YOU WOMEN WHO ARE AT EASE HEAR MY VOICE; YOU COMPLACENT DAUGHTERS GIVE EAR TO MY SPEECH

IN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR YOU WILL SHUDDER YOU COMPLACENT WOMEN; FOR THE GRAPE HARVEST FAILS THE FRUIT HARVEST WILL NOT COME

TREMBLE YOU WOMEN WHO ARE AT EASE SHUDDER YOU COMPLACENT ONES; STRIP AND MAKE YOURSELVES BARE AND TIE SACKCLOTH AROUND YOUR WAIST

BEAT YOUR BREASTS FOR THE PLEASANT FIELDS FOR THE FRUITFUL VINE FOR THE SOIL OF MY PEOPLE GROWING UP IN THORNS AND BRIERS YES FOR ALL THE JOYOUS HOUSES IN THE EXULTANT CITY

FOR THE PALACE IS FORSAKEN THE POPULOUS CITY DESERTED; THE HILL AND THE WATCHTOWER WILL BECOME DENS FOREVER A JOY OF WILD DONKEYS A PASTURE OF FLOCKS; UNTIL THE SPIRIT IS POURED UPON US FROM ON HIGH AND THE WILDERNESS BECOMES A FRUITFUL FIELD AND THE FRUITFUL FIELD IS DEEMED A FOREST

THEN JUSTICE WILL DWELL IN THE WILDERNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS ABIDE IN THE FRUITFUL FIELD

AND THE EFFECT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BE PEACE AND THE RESULT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS QUIETNESS AND TRUST FOREVER

MY PEOPLE WILL ABIDE IN A PEACEFUL HABITATION IN SECURE DWELLINGS AND IN QUIET RESTING PLACES

AND IT WILL HAIL WHEN THE FOREST FALLS DOWN AND THE CITY WILL BE UTTERLY LAID LOW

HAPPY ARE YOU WHO SOW BESIDE ALL WATERS WHO LET THE FEET OF THE OX AND THE DONKEY RANGE FREE

AH YOU DESTROYER WHO YOURSELF HAVE NOT BEEN DESTROYED YOU TRAITOR WHOM NONE HAS BETRAYED

WHEN YOU HAVE CEASED TO DESTROY YOU WILL BE DESTROYED; AND WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED BETRAYING THEY WILL BETRAY YOU

O LORD BE GRACIOUS TO US; WE WAIT FOR YOU

BE OUR ARM EVERY MORNING OUR SALVATION IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE

AT THE TUMULTUOUS NOISE PEOPLES FLEE; WHEN YOU LIFT YOURSELF UP NATIONS ARE SCATTERED AND YOUR SPOIL IS GATHERED AS THE CATERPILLAR GATHERS; AS LOCUSTS LEAP IT IS LEAPT UPON

THE LORD IS EXALTED FOR HE DWELLS ON HIGH; HE WILL FILL ZION WITH JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HE WILL BE THE STABILITY OF YOUR TIMES ABUNDANCE OF SALVATION WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE; THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS ZION'S TREASURE

BEHOLD THEIR HEROES CRY IN THE STREETS; THE ENVOYS OF PEACE WEEP BITTERLY

THE HIGHWAYS LIE WASTE; THE TRAVELER CEASES

COVENANTS ARE BROKEN; CITIES ARE DESPISED; THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MAN

THE LAND MOURNS AND LANGUISHES; LEBANON IS CONFOUNDED AND WITHERS AWAY; SHARON IS LIKE A DESERT AND BASHAN AND CARMEL SHAKE OFF THEIR LEAVES

NOW I WILL ARISE SAYS THE LORD NOW I WILL LIFT MYSELF UP; NOW I WILL BE EXALTED

YOU CONCEIVE CHAFF; YOU GIVE BIRTH TO STUBBLE; YOUR BREATH IS A FIRE THAT WILL CONSUME YOU

AND THE PEOPLES WILL BE AS IF BURNED TO LIME LIKE THORNS CUT DOWN THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE

 HEAR YOU WHO ARE FAR OFF WHAT I HAVE DONE; AND YOU WHO ARE NEAR ACKNOWLEDGE MY MIGHT

THE SINNERS IN ZION ARE AFRAID; TREMBLING HAS SEIZED THE GODLESS WHO AMONG US CAN DWELL WITH THE CONSUMING FIRE

WHO AMONG US CAN DWELL WITH EVERLASTING BURNINGS

 HE WHO WALKS RIGHTEOUSLY AND SPEAKS UPRIGHTLY WHO DESPISES THE GAIN OF OPPRESSIONS WHO SHAKES HIS HANDS LEST THEY HOLD A BRIBE WHO STOPS HIS EARS FROM HEARING OF BLOODSHED AND SHUTS HIS EYES FROM LOOKING ON EVIL HE WILL DWELL ON THE HEIGHTS; HIS PLACE OF DEFENSE WILL BE THE FORTRESSES OF ROCKS; HIS BREAD WILL BE GIVEN HIM; HIS WATER WILL BE SURE

YOUR EYES WILL BEHOLD THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY; THEY WILL SEE A LAND THAT STRETCHES AFAR

YOUR HEART WILL MUSE ON THE TERROR WHERE IS HE WHO COUNTED WHERE IS HE WHO WEIGHED THE TRIBUTE

WHERE IS HE WHO COUNTED THE TOWERS

 YOU WILL SEE NO MORE THE INSOLENT PEOPLE THE PEOPLE OF AN OBSCURE SPEECH THAT YOU CANNOT COMPREHEND STAMMERING IN A TONGUE THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND

BEHOLD ZION THE CITY OF OUR APPOINTED FEASTS

YOUR EYES WILL SEE JERUSALEM AN UNTROUBLED HABITATION AN IMMOVABLE TENT WHOSE STAKES WILL NEVER BE PLUCKED UP NOR WILL ANY OF ITS CORDS BE BROKEN

BUT THERE THE LORD IN MAJESTY WILL BE FOR US A PLACE OF BROAD RIVERS AND STREAMS WHERE NO GALLEY WITH OARS CAN GO NOR MAJESTIC SHIP CAN PASS

FOR THE LORD IS OUR JUDGE; THE LORD IS OUR LAWGIVER; THE LORD IS OUR KING; HE WILL SAVE US

YOUR CORDS HANG LOOSE; THEY CANNOT HOLD THE MAST FIRM IN ITS PLACE OR KEEP THE SAIL SPREAD OUT

THEN PREY AND SPOIL IN ABUNDANCE WILL BE DIVIDED; EVEN THE LAME WILL TAKE THE PREY

AND NO INHABITANT WILL SAY I AM SICK; THE PEOPLE WHO DWELL THERE WILL BE FORGIVEN THEIR INIQUITY

DRAW NEAR O NATIONS TO HEAR AND GIVE ATTENTION O PEOPLES

LET THE EARTH HEAR AND ALL THAT FILLS IT; THE WORLD AND ALL THAT COMES FROM IT

FOR THE LORD IS ENRAGED AGAINST ALL THE NATIONS AND FURIOUS AGAINST ALL THEIR HOST; HE HAS DEVOTED THEM TO DESTRUCTION HAS GIVEN THEM OVER FOR SLAUGHTER

THEIR SLAIN SHALL BE CAST OUT AND THE STENCH OF THEIR CORPSES SHALL RISE; THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH THEIR BLOOD

ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN SHALL ROT AWAY AND THE SKIES ROLL UP LIKE A SCROLL

ALL THEIR HOST SHALL FALL AS LEAVES FALL FROM THE VINE LIKE LEAVES FALLING FROM THE FIG TREE

FOR MY SWORD HAS DRUNK ITS FILL IN THE HEAVENS; BEHOLD IT DESCENDS FOR JUDGMENT UPON EDOM UPON THE PEOPLE I HAVE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION

THE LORD HAS A SWORD; IT IS SATED WITH BLOOD; IT IS GORGED WITH FAT WITH THE BLOOD OF LAMBS AND GOATS WITH THE FAT OF THE KIDNEYS OF RAMS

FOR THE LORD HAS A SACRIFICE IN BOZRAH A GREAT SLAUGHTER IN THE LAND OF EDOM

WILD OXEN SHALL FALL WITH THEM AND YOUNG STEERS WITH THE MIGHTY BULLS

THEIR LAND SHALL DRINK ITS FILL OF BLOOD AND THEIR SOIL SHALL BE GORGED WITH FAT

FOR THE LORD HAS A DAY OF VENGEANCE A YEAR OF RECOMPENSE FOR THE CAUSE OF ZION

AND THE STREAMS OF EDOM SHALL BE TURNED INTO PITCH AND HER SOIL INTO SULFUR; HER LAND SHALL BECOME BURNING PITCH

NIGHT AND DAY IT SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED; ITS SMOKE SHALL GO UP FOREVER

FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION IT SHALL LIE WASTE; NONE SHALL PASS THROUGH IT FOREVER AND EVER

BUT THE HAWK AND THE PORCUPINE SHALL POSSESS IT THE OWL AND THE RAVEN SHALL DWELL IN IT

HE SHALL STRETCH THE LINE OF CONFUSION OVER IT AND THE PLUMB LINE OF EMPTINESS

ITS NOBLESTHERE IS NO ONE THERE TO CALL IT A KINGDOM AND ALL ITS PRINCES SHALL BE NOTHING

THORNS SHALL GROW OVER ITS STRONGHOLDS NETTLES AND THISTLES IN ITS FORTRESSES

IT SHALL BE THE HAUNT OF JACKALS AN ABODE FOR OSTRICHES

AND WILD ANIMALS SHALL MEET WITH HYENAS; THE WILD GOAT SHALL CRY TO HIS FELLOW; INDEED THERE THE NIGHT BIRD SETTLES AND FINDS FOR HERSELF A RESTING PLACE

THERE THE OWL NESTS AND LAYS AND HATCHES AND GATHERS HER YOUNG IN HER SHADOW; INDEED THERE THE HAWKS ARE GATHERED EACH ONE WITH HER MATE

SEEK AND READ FROM THE BOOK OF THE LORD NOT ONE OF THESE SHALL BE MISSING; NONE SHALL BE WITHOUT HER MATE

FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AND HIS SPIRIT HAS GATHERED THEM

HE HAS CAST THE LOT FOR THEM; HIS HAND HAS PORTIONED IT OUT TO THEM WITH THE LINE; THEY SHALL POSSESS IT FOREVER; FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION THEY SHALL DWELL IN IT

THE WILDERNESS AND THE DRY LAND SHALL BE GLAD; THE DESERT SHALL REJOICE AND BLOSSOM LIKE THE CROCUS; IT SHALL BLOSSOM ABUNDANTLY AND REJOICE WITH JOY AND SINGING

THE GLORY OF LEBANON SHALL BE GIVEN TO IT THE MAJESTY OF CARMEL AND SHARON

THEY SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE LORD THE MAJESTY OF OUR GOD

STRENGTHEN THE WEAK HANDS AND MAKE FIRM THE FEEBLE KNEES

SAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE AN ANXIOUS HEART BE STRONG; FEAR NOT

BEHOLD YOUR GOD WILL COME WITH VENGEANCE WITH THE RECOMPENSE OF GOD

HE WILL COME AND SAVE YOU

 THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED AND THE EARS OF THE DEAF UNSTOPPED; THEN SHALL THE LAME MAN LEAP LIKE A DEER AND THE TONGUE OF THE MUTE SING FOR JOY

FOR WATERS BREAK FORTH IN THE WILDERNESS AND STREAMS IN THE DESERT; THE BURNING SAND SHALL BECOME A POOL AND THE THIRSTY GROUND SPRINGS OF WATER; IN THE HAUNT OF JACKALS WHERE THEY LIE DOWN THE GRASS SHALL BECOME REEDS AND RUSHES

AND A HIGHWAY SHALL BE THERE AND IT SHALL BE CALLED THE WAY OF HOLINESS; THE UNCLEAN SHALL NOT PASS OVER IT

IT SHALL BELONG TO THOSE WHO WALK ON THE WAY; EVEN IF THEY ARE FOOLS THEY SHALL NOT GO ASTRAY

NO LION SHALL BE THERE NOR SHALL ANY RAVENOUS BEAST COME UP ON IT; THEY SHALL NOT BE FOUND THERE BUT THE REDEEMED SHALL WALK THERE

AND THE RANSOMED OF THE LORD SHALL RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH SINGING; EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UPON THEIR HEADS; THEY SHALL OBTAIN GLADNESS AND JOY AND SORROW AND SIGHING SHALL FLEE AWAY

IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR OF KING HEZEKIAH SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA CAME UP AGAINST ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH AND TOOK THEM

AND THE KING OF ASSYRIA SENT THE RABSHAKEH FROM LACHISH TO KING HEZEKIAH AT JERUSALEM WITH A GREAT ARMY

AND HE STOOD BY THE CONDUIT OF THE UPPER POOL ON THE HIGHWAY TO THE WASHER'S FIELD

AND THERE CAME OUT TO HIM ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNA THE SECRETARY AND JOAH THE SON OF ASAPH THE RECORDER

AND THE RABSHAKEH SAID TO THEM SAY TO HEZEKIAH 'THUS SAYS THE GREAT KING THE KING OF ASSYRIA ON WHAT DO YOU REST THIS TRUST OF YOURS

DO YOU THINK THAT MERE WORDS ARE STRATEGY AND POWER FOR WAR

IN WHOM DO YOU NOW TRUST THAT YOU HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

BEHOLD YOU ARE TRUSTING IN EGYPT THAT BROKEN REED OF A STAFF WHICH WILL PIERCE THE HAND OF ANY MAN WHO LEANS ON IT

SUCH IS PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT TO ALL WHO TRUST IN HIM

BUT IF YOU SAY TO ME WE TRUST IN THE LORD OUR GOD IS IT NOT HE WHOSE HIGH PLACES AND ALTARS HEZEKIAH HAS REMOVED SAYING TO JUDAH AND TO JERUSALEM YOU SHALL WORSHIP BEFORE THIS ALTAR

COME NOW MAKE A WAGER WITH MY MASTER THE KING OF ASSYRIA I WILL GIVE YOU TWO THOUSAND HORSES IF YOU ARE ABLE ON YOUR PART TO SET RIDERS ON THEM

HOW THEN CAN YOU REPULSE A SINGLE CAPTAIN AMONG THE LEAST OF MY MASTER'S SERVANTS WHEN YOU TRUST IN EGYPT FOR CHARIOTS AND FOR HORSEMEN

MOREOVER IS IT WITHOUT THE LORD THAT I HAVE COME UP AGAINST THIS LAND TO DESTROY IT

THE LORD SAID TO ME GO UP AGAINST THIS LAND AND DESTROY IT

' THEN ELIAKIM SHEBNA AND JOAH SAID TO THE RABSHAKEH PLEASE SPEAK TO YOUR SERVANTS IN ARAMAIC FOR WE UNDERSTAND IT

DO NOT SPEAK TO US IN THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH WITHIN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE WALL

 BUT THE RABSHAKEH SAID HAS MY MASTER SENT ME TO SPEAK THESE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER AND TO YOU AND NOT TO THE MEN SITTING ON THE WALL WHO ARE DOOMED WITH YOU TO EAT THEIR OWN DUNG AND DRINK THEIR OWN URINE

 THEN THE RABSHAKEH STOOD AND CALLED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE IN THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH HEAR THE WORDS OF THE GREAT KING THE KING OF ASSYRIA

THUS SAYS THE KING 'DO NOT LET HEZEKIAH DECEIVE YOU FOR HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER YOU

DO NOT LET HEZEKIAH MAKE YOU TRUST IN THE LORD BY SAYING THE LORD WILL SURELY DELIVER US

THIS CITY WILL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

 DO NOT LISTEN TO HEZEKIAH

FOR THUS SAYS THE KING OF ASSYRIA MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH ME AND COME OUT TO ME

THEN EACH ONE OF YOU WILL EAT OF HIS OWN VINE AND EACH ONE OF HIS OWN FIG TREE AND EACH ONE OF YOU WILL DRINK THE WATER OF HIS OWN CISTERN UNTIL I COME AND TAKE YOU AWAY TO A LAND LIKE YOUR OWN LAND A LAND OF GRAIN AND WINE A LAND OF BREAD AND VINEYARDS

BEWARE LEST HEZEKIAH MISLEAD YOU BY SAYING THE LORD WILL DELIVER US

 HAS ANY OF THE GODS OF THE NATIONS DELIVERED HIS LAND OUT OF THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

WHERE ARE THE GODS OF HAMATH AND ARPAD

WHERE ARE THE GODS OF SEPHARVAIM

HAVE THEY DELIVERED SAMARIA OUT OF MY HAND

WHO AMONG ALL THE GODS OF THESE LANDS HAVE DELIVERED THEIR LANDS OUT OF MY HAND THAT THE LORD SHOULD DELIVER JERUSALEM OUT OF MY HAND

' BUT THEY WERE SILENT AND ANSWERED HIM NOT A WORD FOR THE KING'S COMMAND WAS DO NOT ANSWER HIM

 THEN ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNA THE SECRETARY AND JOAH THE SON OF ASAPH THE RECORDER CAME TO HEZEKIAH WITH THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND TOLD HIM THE WORDS OF THE RABSHAKEH

AS SOON AS KING HEZEKIAH HEARD IT HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH SACKCLOTH AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE SENT ELIAKIM WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNA THE SECRETARY AND THE SENIOR PRIESTS COVERED WITH SACKCLOTH TO THE PROPHET ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ

THEY SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS HEZEKIAH 'THIS DAY IS A DAY OF DISTRESS OF REBUKE AND OF DISGRACE; CHILDREN HAVE COME TO THE POINT OF BIRTH AND THERE IS NO STRENGTH TO BRING THEM FORTH

IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL HEAR THE WORDS OF THE RABSHAKEH WHOM HIS MASTER THE KING OF ASSYRIA HAS SENT TO MOCK THE LIVING GOD AND WILL REBUKE THE WORDS THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS HEARD; THEREFORE LIFT UP YOUR PRAYER FOR THE REMNANT THAT IS LEFT

' WHEN THE SERVANTS OF KING HEZEKIAH CAME TO ISAIAH ISAIAH SAID TO THEM SAY TO YOUR MASTER 'THUS SAYS THE LORD DO NOT BE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD WITH WHICH THE YOUNG MEN OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA HAVE REVILED ME

BEHOLD I WILL PUT A SPIRIT IN HIM SO THAT HE SHALL HEAR A RUMOR AND RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND AND I WILL MAKE HIM FALL BY THE SWORD IN HIS OWN LAND

' THE RABSHAKEH RETURNED AND FOUND THE KING OF ASSYRIA FIGHTING AGAINST LIBNAH FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING HAD LEFT LACHISH

NOW THE KING HEARD CONCERNING TIRHAKAH KING OF CUSH HE HAS SET OUT TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU

 AND WHEN HE HEARD IT HE SENT MESSENGERS TO HEZEKIAH SAYING THUS SHALL YOU SPEAK TO HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH 'DO NOT LET YOUR GOD IN WHOM YOU TRUST DECEIVE YOU BY PROMISING THAT JERUSALEM WILL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

BEHOLD YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA HAVE DONE TO ALL LANDS DEVOTING THEM TO DESTRUCTION

AND SHALL YOU BE DELIVERED

HAVE THE GODS OF THE NATIONS DELIVERED THEM THE NATIONS THAT MY FATHERS DESTROYED GOZAN HARAN REZEPH AND THE PEOPLE OF EDEN WHO WERE IN TELASSAR

WHERE IS THE KING OF HAMATH THE KING OF ARPAD THE KING OF THE CITY OF SEPHARVAIM THE KING OF HENA OR THE KING OF IVVAH

' HEZEKIAH RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM THE HAND OF THE MESSENGERS AND READ IT; AND HEZEKIAH WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SPREAD IT BEFORE THE LORD

AND HEZEKIAH PRAYED TO THE LORD O LORD OF HOSTS GOD OF ISRAEL WHO IS ENTHRONED ABOVE THE CHERUBIM YOU ARE THE GOD YOU ALONE OF ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH; YOU HAVE MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH

INCLINE YOUR EAR O LORD AND HEAR; OPEN YOUR EYES O LORD AND SEE; AND HEAR ALL THE WORDS OF SENNACHERIB WHICH HE HAS SENT TO MOCK THE LIVING GOD

TRULY O LORD THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA HAVE LAID WASTE ALL THE NATIONS AND THEIR LANDS AND HAVE CAST THEIR GODS INTO THE FIRE

FOR THEY WERE NO GODS BUT THE WORK OF MEN'S HANDS WOOD AND STONE

THEREFORE THEY WERE DESTROYED

SO NOW O LORD OUR GOD SAVE US FROM HIS HAND THAT ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW THAT YOU ALONE ARE THE LORD

 THEN ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ SENT TO HEZEKIAH SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BECAUSE YOU HAVE PRAYED TO ME CONCERNING SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA THIS IS THE WORD THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN CONCERNING HIM 'SHE DESPISES YOU SHE SCORNS YOUTHE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF ZION; SHE WAGS HER HEAD BEHIND YOUTHE DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

'WHOM HAVE YOU MOCKED AND REVILED

AGAINST WHOM HAVE YOU RAISED YOUR VOICE AND LIFTED YOUR EYES TO THE HEIGHTS

AGAINST THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

BY YOUR SERVANTS YOU HAVE MOCKED THE LORD AND YOU HAVE SAID WITH MY MANY CHARIOTS I HAVE GONE UP THE HEIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE FAR RECESSES OF LEBANON TO CUT DOWN ITS TALLEST CEDARS ITS CHOICEST CYPRESSES TO COME TO ITS REMOTEST HEIGHT ITS MOST FRUITFUL FOREST

I DUG WELLS AND DRANK WATERS TO DRY UP WITH THE SOLE OF MY FOOT ALL THE STREAMS OF EGYPT

'HAVE YOU NOT HEARD THAT I DETERMINED IT LONG AGO

I PLANNED FROM DAYS OF OLD WHAT NOW I BRING TO PASS THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE FORTIFIED CITIES CRASH INTO HEAPS OF RUINS WHILE THEIR INHABITANTS SHORN OF STRENGTH ARE DISMAYED AND CONFOUNDED AND HAVE BECOME LIKE PLANTS OF THE FIELD AND LIKE TENDER GRASS LIKE GRASS ON THE HOUSETOPS BLIGHTED BEFORE IT IS GROWN

'I KNOW YOUR SITTING DOWN AND YOUR GOING OUT AND COMING IN AND YOUR RAGING AGAINST ME

BECAUSE YOU HAVE RAGED AGAINST ME AND YOUR COMPLACENCY HAS COME TO MY EARS I WILL PUT MY HOOK IN YOUR NOSE AND MY BIT IN YOUR MOUTH AND I WILL TURN YOU BACK ON THE WAY BY WHICH YOU CAME

' AND THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN FOR YOU THIS YEAR YOU SHALL EAT WHAT GROWS OF ITSELF AND IN THE SECOND YEAR WHAT SPRINGS FROM THAT

THEN IN THE THIRD YEAR SOW AND REAP AND PLANT VINEYARDS AND EAT THEIR FRUIT

AND THE SURVIVING REMNANT OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL AGAIN TAKE ROOT DOWNWARD AND BEAR FRUIT UPWARD

FOR OUT OF JERUSALEM SHALL GO A REMNANT AND OUT OF MOUNT ZION A BAND OF SURVIVORS

THE ZEAL OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL DO THIS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE KING OF ASSYRIA HE SHALL NOT COME INTO THIS CITY OR SHOOT AN ARROW THERE OR COME BEFORE IT WITH A SHIELD OR CAST UP A SIEGE MOUND AGAINST IT

BY THE WAY THAT HE CAME BY THE SAME HE SHALL RETURN AND HE SHALL NOT COME INTO THIS CITY DECLARES THE LORD

FOR I WILL DEFEND THIS CITY TO SAVE IT FOR MY OWN SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF MY SERVANT DAVID

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND STRUCK DOWN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTYFIVE THOUSAND IN THE CAMP OF THE ASSYRIANS

AND WHEN PEOPLE AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING BEHOLD THESE WERE ALL DEAD BODIES

THEN SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA DEPARTED AND RETURNED HOME AND LIVED AT NINEVEH

AND AS HE WAS WORSHIPING IN THE HOUSE OF NISROCH HIS GOD ADRAMMELECH AND SHAREZER HIS SONS STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH THE SWORD

AND AFTER THEY ESCAPED INTO THE LAND OF ARARAT ESARHADDON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THOSE DAYS HEZEKIAH BECAME SICK AND WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH

AND ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE SON OF AMOZ CAME TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER FOR YOU SHALL DIE YOU SHALL NOT RECOVER

 THEN HEZEKIAH TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND PRAYED TO THE LORD AND SAID PLEASE O LORD REMEMBER HOW I HAVE WALKED BEFORE YOU IN FAITHFULNESS AND WITH A WHOLE HEART AND HAVE DONE WHAT IS GOOD IN YOUR SIGHT

 AND HEZEKIAH WEPT BITTERLY

THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ISAIAH GO AND SAY TO HEZEKIAH THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF DAVID YOUR FATHER I HAVE HEARD YOUR PRAYER; I HAVE SEEN YOUR TEARS

BEHOLD I WILL ADD FIFTEEN YEARS TO YOUR LIFE

I WILL DELIVER YOU AND THIS CITY OUT OF THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND WILL DEFEND THIS CITY

THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO YOU FROM THE LORD THAT THE LORD WILL DO THIS THING THAT HE HAS PROMISED BEHOLD I WILL MAKE THE SHADOW CAST BY THE DECLINING SUN ON THE DIAL OF AHAZ TURN BACK TEN STEPS

 SO THE SUN TURNED BACK ON THE DIAL THE TEN STEPS BY WHICH IT HAD DECLINED

A WRITING OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AFTER HE HAD BEEN SICK AND HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS I SAID IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DAYS I MUST DEPART; I AM CONSIGNED TO THE GATES OF SHEOL FOR THE REST OF MY YEARS

I SAID I SHALL NOT SEE THE LORD THE LORD IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING; I SHALL LOOK ON MAN NO MORE AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD

MY DWELLING IS PLUCKED UP AND REMOVED FROM ME LIKE A SHEPHERD'S TENT; LIKE A WEAVER I HAVE ROLLED UP MY LIFE; HE CUTS ME OFF FROM THE LOOM; FROM DAY TO NIGHT YOU BRING ME TO AN END; I CALMED MYSELF UNTIL MORNING; LIKE A LION HE BREAKS ALL MY BONES; FROM DAY TO NIGHT YOU BRING ME TO AN END

LIKE A SWALLOW OR A CRANE I CHIRP; I MOAN LIKE A DOVE

MY EYES ARE WEARY WITH LOOKING UPWARD

O LORD I AM OPPRESSED; BE MY PLEDGE OF SAFETY

WHAT SHALL I SAY

FOR HE HAS SPOKEN TO ME AND HE HIMSELF HAS DONE IT

I WALK SLOWLY ALL MY YEARS BECAUSE OF THE BITTERNESS OF MY SOUL

O LORD BY THESE THINGS MEN LIVE AND IN ALL THESE IS THE LIFE OF MY SPIRIT

OH RESTORE ME TO HEALTH AND MAKE ME LIVE

BEHOLD IT WAS FOR MY WELFARE THAT I HAD GREAT BITTERNESS; BUT IN LOVE YOU HAVE DELIVERED MY LIFE FROM THE PIT OF DESTRUCTION FOR YOU HAVE CAST ALL MY SINS BEHIND YOUR BACK

FOR SHEOL DOES NOT THANK YOU; DEATH DOES NOT PRAISE YOU; THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT DO NOT HOPE FOR YOUR FAITHFULNESS

THE LIVING THE LIVING HE THANKS YOU AS I DO THIS DAY; THE FATHER MAKES KNOWN TO THE CHILDREN YOUR FAITHFULNESS

THE LORD WILL SAVE ME AND WE WILL PLAY MY MUSIC ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES AT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

NOW ISAIAH HAD SAID LET THEM TAKE A CAKE OF FIGS AND APPLY IT TO THE BOIL THAT HE MAY RECOVER

 HEZEKIAH ALSO HAD SAID WHAT IS THE SIGN THAT I SHALL GO UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AT THAT TIME MERODACHBALADAN THE SON OF BALADAN KING OF BABYLON SENT ENVOYS WITH LETTERS AND A PRESENT TO HEZEKIAH FOR HE HEARD THAT HE HAD BEEN SICK AND HAD RECOVERED

AND HEZEKIAH WELCOMED THEM GLADLY

AND HE SHOWED THEM HIS TREASURE HOUSE THE SILVER THE GOLD THE SPICES THE PRECIOUS OIL HIS WHOLE ARMORY ALL THAT WAS FOUND IN HIS STOREHOUSES

THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS HOUSE OR IN ALL HIS REALM THAT HEZEKIAH DID NOT SHOW THEM

THEN ISAIAH THE PROPHET CAME TO KING HEZEKIAH AND SAID TO HIM WHAT DID THESE MEN SAY

AND FROM WHERE DID THEY COME TO YOU

 HEZEKIAH SAID THEY HAVE COME TO ME FROM A FAR COUNTRY FROM BABYLON

 HE SAID WHAT HAVE THEY SEEN IN YOUR HOUSE

 HEZEKIAH ANSWERED THEY HAVE SEEN ALL THAT IS IN MY HOUSE

THERE IS NOTHING IN MY STOREHOUSES THAT I DID NOT SHOW THEM

 THEN ISAIAH SAID TO HEZEKIAH HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN ALL THAT IS IN YOUR HOUSE AND THAT WHICH YOUR FATHERS HAVE STORED UP TILL THIS DAY SHALL BE CARRIED TO BABYLON

NOTHING SHALL BE LEFT SAYS THE LORD

AND SOME OF YOUR OWN SONS WHO WILL COME FROM YOU WHOM YOU WILL FATHER SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY AND THEY SHALL BE EUNUCHS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF BABYLON

 THEN SAID HEZEKIAH TO ISAIAH THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN IS GOOD

 FOR HE THOUGHT THERE WILL BE PEACE AND SECURITY IN MY DAYS

COMFORT COMFORT MY PEOPLE SAYS YOUR GOD

SPEAK TENDERLY TO JERUSALEM AND CRY TO HER THAT HER WARFARE IS ENDED THAT HER INIQUITY IS PARDONED THAT SHE HAS RECEIVED FROM THE LORD'S HAND DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS

A VOICE CRIES IN THE WILDERNESS PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD; MAKE STRAIGHT IN THE DESERT A HIGHWAY FOR OUR GOD

EVERY VALLEY SHALL BE LIFTED UP AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL BE MADE LOW; THE UNEVEN GROUND SHALL BECOME LEVEL AND THE ROUGH PLACES A PLAIN

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE REVEALED AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE IT TOGETHER FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

 A VOICE SAYS CRY

 AND I SAID WHAT SHALL I CRY

 ALL FLESH IS GRASS AND ALL ITS BEAUTY IS LIKE THE FLOWER OF THE FIELD

THE GRASS WITHERS THE FLOWER FADES WHEN THE BREATH OF THE LORD BLOWS ON IT; SURELY THE PEOPLE ARE GRASS

THE GRASS WITHERS THE FLOWER FADES BUT THE WORD OF OUR GOD WILL STAND FOREVER

GET YOU UP TO A HIGH MOUNTAIN O ZION HERALD OF GOOD NEWS; LIFT UP YOUR VOICE WITH STRENGTH O JERUSALEM HERALD OF GOOD NEWS; LIFT IT UP FEAR NOT; SAY TO THE CITIES OF JUDAH BEHOLD YOUR GOD

 BEHOLD THE LORD GOD COMES WITH MIGHT AND HIS ARM RULES FOR HIM; BEHOLD HIS REWARD IS WITH HIM AND HIS RECOMPENSE BEFORE HIM

HE WILL TEND HIS FLOCK LIKE A SHEPHERD; HE WILL GATHER THE LAMBS IN HIS ARMS; HE WILL CARRY THEM IN HIS BOSOM AND GENTLY LEAD THOSE THAT ARE WITH YOUNG

WHO HAS MEASURED THE WATERS IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND MARKED OFF THE HEAVENS WITH A SPAN ENCLOSED THE DUST OF THE EARTH IN A MEASURE AND WEIGHED THE MOUNTAINS IN SCALES AND THE HILLS IN A BALANCE

WHO HAS MEASURED THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD OR WHAT MAN SHOWS HIM HIS COUNSEL

WHOM DID HE CONSULT AND WHO MADE HIM UNDERSTAND

WHO TAUGHT HIM THE PATH OF JUSTICE AND TAUGHT HIM KNOWLEDGE AND SHOWED HIM THE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING

BEHOLD THE NATIONS ARE LIKE A DROP FROM A BUCKET AND ARE ACCOUNTED AS THE DUST ON THE SCALES; BEHOLD HE TAKES UP THE COASTLANDS LIKE FINE DUST

LEBANON WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR FUEL NOR ARE ITS BEASTS ENOUGH FOR A BURNT OFFERING

ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM THEY ARE ACCOUNTED BY HIM AS LESS THAN NOTHING AND EMPTINESS

TO WHOM THEN WILL YOU LIKEN GOD OR WHAT LIKENESS COMPARE WITH HIM

AN IDOL

A CRAFTSMAN CASTS IT AND A GOLDSMITH OVERLAYS IT WITH GOLD AND CASTS FOR IT SILVER CHAINS

HE WHO IS TOO IMPOVERISHED FOR AN OFFERING CHOOSES WOOD THAT WILL NOT ROT; HE SEEKS OUT A SKILLFUL CRAFTSMAN TO SET UP AN IDOL THAT WILL NOT MOVE

DO YOU NOT KNOW

DO YOU NOT HEAR

HAS IT NOT BEEN TOLD YOU FROM THE BEGINNING

HAVE YOU NOT UNDERSTOOD FROM THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH

IT IS HE WHO SITS ABOVE THE CIRCLE OF THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS ARE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS; WHO STRETCHES OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN AND SPREADS THEM LIKE A TENT TO DWELL IN; WHO BRINGS PRINCES TO NOTHING AND MAKES THE RULERS OF THE EARTH AS EMPTINESS

SCARCELY ARE THEY PLANTED SCARCELY SOWN SCARCELY HAS THEIR STEM TAKEN ROOT IN THE EARTH WHEN HE BLOWS ON THEM AND THEY WITHER AND THE TEMPEST CARRIES THEM OFF LIKE STUBBLE

TO WHOM THEN WILL YOU COMPARE ME THAT I SHOULD BE LIKE HIM

SAYS THE HOLY ONE

LIFT UP YOUR EYES ON HIGH AND SEE WHO CREATED THESE

HE WHO BRINGS OUT THEIR HOST BY NUMBER CALLING THEM ALL BY NAME BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS MIGHT AND BECAUSE HE IS STRONG IN POWER NOT ONE IS MISSING

WHY DO YOU SAY O JACOB AND SPEAK O ISRAEL MY WAY IS HIDDEN FROM THE LORD AND MY RIGHT IS DISREGARDED BY MY GOD

HAVE YOU NOT KNOWN

HAVE YOU NOT HEARD

THE LORD IS THE EVERLASTING GOD THE CREATOR OF THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

HE DOES NOT FAINT OR GROW WEARY; HIS UNDERSTANDING IS UNSEARCHABLE

HE GIVES POWER TO THE FAINT AND TO HIM WHO HAS NO MIGHT HE INCREASES STRENGTH

EVEN YOUTHS SHALL FAINT AND BE WEARY AND YOUNG MEN SHALL FALL EXHAUSTED; BUT THEY WHO WAIT FOR THE LORD SHALL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH; THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS LIKE EAGLES; THEY SHALL RUN AND NOT BE WEARY; THEY SHALL WALK AND NOT FAINT

LISTEN TO ME IN SILENCE O COASTLANDS; LET THE PEOPLES RENEW THEIR STRENGTH; LET THEM APPROACH THEN LET THEM SPEAK; LET US TOGETHER DRAW NEAR FOR JUDGMENT

WHO STIRRED UP ONE FROM THE EAST WHOM VICTORY MEETS AT EVERY STEP

HE GIVES UP NATIONS BEFORE HIM SO THAT HE TRAMPLES KINGS UNDERFOOT; HE MAKES THEM LIKE DUST WITH HIS SWORD LIKE DRIVEN STUBBLE WITH HIS BOW

HE PURSUES THEM AND PASSES ON SAFELY BY PATHS HIS FEET HAVE NOT TROD

WHO HAS PERFORMED AND DONE THIS CALLING THE GENERATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING

I THE LORD THE FIRST AND WITH THE LAST; I AM HE

THE COASTLANDS HAVE SEEN AND ARE AFRAID; THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TREMBLE; THEY HAVE DRAWN NEAR AND COME

EVERYONE HELPS HIS NEIGHBOR AND SAYS TO HIS BROTHER BE STRONG

 THE CRAFTSMAN STRENGTHENS THE GOLDSMITH AND HE WHO SMOOTHS WITH THE HAMMER HIM WHO STRIKES THE ANVIL SAYING OF THE SOLDERING IT IS GOOD; AND THEY STRENGTHEN IT WITH NAILS SO THAT IT CANNOT BE MOVED

BUT YOU ISRAEL MY SERVANT JACOB WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN THE OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM MY FRIEND; YOU WHOM I TOOK FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND CALLED FROM ITS FARTHEST CORNERS SAYING TO YOU YOU ARE MY SERVANT I HAVE CHOSEN YOU AND NOT CAST YOU OFF; FEAR NOT FOR I AM WITH YOU; BE NOT DISMAYED FOR I AM YOUR GOD; I WILL STRENGTHEN YOU I WILL HELP YOU I WILL UPHOLD YOU WITH MY RIGHTEOUS RIGHT HAND

BEHOLD ALL WHO ARE INCENSED AGAINST YOU SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME AND CONFOUNDED; THOSE WHO STRIVE AGAINST YOU SHALL BE AS NOTHING AND SHALL PERISH

YOU SHALL SEEK THOSE WHO CONTEND WITH YOU BUT YOU SHALL NOT FIND THEM; THOSE WHO WAR AGAINST YOU SHALL BE AS NOTHING AT ALL

FOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD HOLD YOUR RIGHT HAND; IT IS I WHO SAY TO YOU FEAR NOT I AM THE ONE WHO HELPS YOU

 FEAR NOT YOU WORM JACOB YOU MEN OF ISRAEL

I AM THE ONE WHO HELPS YOU DECLARES THE LORD; YOUR REDEEMER IS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

BEHOLD I MAKE OF YOU A THRESHING SLEDGE NEW SHARP AND HAVING TEETH; YOU SHALL THRESH THE MOUNTAINS AND CRUSH THEM AND YOU SHALL MAKE THE HILLS LIKE CHAFF; YOU SHALL WINNOW THEM AND THE WIND SHALL CARRY THEM AWAY AND THE TEMPEST SHALL SCATTER THEM

AND YOU SHALL REJOICE IN THE LORD; IN THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL YOU SHALL GLORY

WHEN THE POOR AND NEEDY SEEK WATER AND THERE IS NONE AND THEIR TONGUE IS PARCHED WITH THIRST I THE LORD WILL ANSWER THEM; I THE GOD OF ISRAEL WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM

I WILL OPEN RIVERS ON THE BARE HEIGHTS AND FOUNTAINS IN THE MIDST OF THE VALLEYS

I WILL MAKE THE WILDERNESS A POOL OF WATER AND THE DRY LAND SPRINGS OF WATER

I WILL PUT IN THE WILDERNESS THE CEDAR THE ACACIA THE MYRTLE AND THE OLIVE

I WILL SET IN THE DESERT THE CYPRESS THE PLANE AND THE PINE TOGETHER THAT THEY MAY SEE AND KNOW MAY CONSIDER AND UNDERSTAND TOGETHER THAT THE HAND OF THE LORD HAS DONE THIS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL HAS CREATED IT

SET FORTH YOUR CASE SAYS THE LORD; BRING YOUR PROOFS SAYS THE KING OF JACOB

LET THEM BRING THEM AND TELL US WHAT IS TO HAPPEN

TELL US THE FORMER THINGS WHAT THEY ARE THAT WE MAY CONSIDER THEM THAT WE MAY KNOW THEIR OUTCOME; OR DECLARE TO US THE THINGS TO COME

TELL US WHAT IS TO COME HEREAFTER THAT WE MAY KNOW THAT YOU ARE GODS; DO GOOD OR DO HARM THAT WE MAY BE DISMAYED AND TERRIFIED

BEHOLD YOU ARE NOTHING AND YOUR WORK IS LESS THAN NOTHING; AN ABOMINATION IS HE WHO CHOOSES YOU

I STIRRED UP ONE FROM THE NORTH AND HE HAS COME FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN AND HE SHALL CALL UPON MY NAME; HE SHALL TRAMPLE ON RULERS AS ON MORTAR AS THE POTTER TREADS CLAY

WHO DECLARED IT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WE MIGHT KNOW AND BEFOREHAND THAT WE MIGHT SAY HE IS RIGHT

THERE WAS NONE WHO DECLARED IT NONE WHO PROCLAIMED NONE WHO HEARD YOUR WORDS

I WAS THE FIRST TO SAY TO ZION BEHOLD HERE THEY ARE

 AND I GIVE TO JERUSALEM A HERALD OF GOOD NEWS

BUT WHEN I LOOK THERE IS NO ONE; AMONG THESE THERE IS NO COUNSELOR WHO WHEN I ASK GIVES AN ANSWER

BEHOLD THEY ARE ALL A DELUSION; THEIR WORKS ARE NOTHING; THEIR METAL IMAGES ARE EMPTY WIND

BEHOLD MY SERVANT WHOM I UPHOLD MY CHOSEN IN WHOM MY SOUL DELIGHTS; I HAVE PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM; HE WILL BRING FORTH JUSTICE TO THE NATIONS

HE WILL NOT CRY ALOUD OR LIFT UP HIS VOICE OR MAKE IT HEARD IN THE STREET; A BRUISED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK AND A FAINTLY BURNING WICK HE WILL NOT QUENCH; HE WILL FAITHFULLY BRING FORTH JUSTICE

HE WILL NOT GROW FAINT OR BE DISCOURAGED TILL HE HAS ESTABLISHED JUSTICE IN THE EARTH; AND THE COASTLANDS WAIT FOR HIS LAW

THUS SAYS GOD THE LORD WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND STRETCHED THEM OUT WHO SPREAD OUT THE EARTH AND WHAT COMES FROM IT WHO GIVES BREATH TO THE PEOPLE ON IT AND SPIRIT TO THOSE WHO WALK IN IT I AM THE LORD; I HAVE CALLED YOU IN RIGHTEOUSNESS; I WILL TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND KEEP YOU; I WILL GIVE YOU AS A COVENANT FOR THE PEOPLE A LIGHT FOR THE NATIONS TO OPEN THE EYES THAT ARE BLIND TO BRING OUT THE PRISONERS FROM THE DUNGEON FROM THE PRISON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS

I AM THE LORD; THAT IS MY NAME; MY GLORY I GIVE TO NO OTHER NOR MY PRAISE TO CARVED IDOLS

BEHOLD THE FORMER THINGS HAVE COME TO PASS AND NEW THINGS I NOW DECLARE; BEFORE THEY SPRING FORTH I TELL YOU OF THEM

 SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG HIS PRAISE FROM THE END OF THE EARTH YOU WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA AND ALL THAT FILLS IT THE COASTLANDS AND THEIR INHABITANTS

LET THE DESERT AND ITS CITIES LIFT UP THEIR VOICE THE VILLAGES THAT KEDAR INHABITS; LET THE HABITANTS OF SELA SING FOR JOY LET THEM SHOUT FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS

LET THEM GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD AND DECLARE HIS PRAISE IN THE COASTLANDS

THE LORD GOES OUT LIKE A MIGHTY MAN LIKE A MAN OF WAR HE STIRS UP HIS ZEAL; HE CRIES OUT HE SHOUTS ALOUD HE SHOWS HIMSELF MIGHTY AGAINST HIS FOES

FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE HELD MY PEACE; I HAVE KEPT STILL AND RESTRAINED MYSELF; NOW I WILL CRY OUT LIKE A WOMAN IN LABOR; I WILL GASP AND PANT

I WILL LAY WASTE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS AND DRY UP ALL THEIR VEGETATION; I WILL TURN THE RIVERS INTO ISLANDS AND DRY UP THE POOLS

AND I WILL LEAD THE BLIND IN A WAY THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IN PATHS THAT THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN I WILL GUIDE THEM

I WILL TURN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THEM INTO LIGHT THE ROUGH PLACES INTO LEVEL GROUND

THESE ARE THE THINGS I DO AND I DO NOT FORSAKE THEM

THEY ARE TURNED BACK AND UTTERLY PUT TO SHAME WHO TRUST IN CARVED IDOLS WHO SAY TO METAL IMAGES YOU ARE OUR GODS

 HEAR YOU DEAF AND LOOK YOU BLIND THAT YOU MAY SEE

WHO IS BLIND BUT MY SERVANT OR DEAF AS MY MESSENGER WHOM I SEND

WHO IS BLIND AS MY DEDICATED ONE OR BLIND AS THE SERVANT OF THE LORD

HE SEES MANY THINGS BUT DOES NOT OBSERVE THEM; HIS EARS ARE OPEN BUT HE DOES NOT HEAR

THE LORD WAS PLEASED FOR HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE TO MAGNIFY HIS LAW AND MAKE IT GLORIOUS

BUT THIS IS A PEOPLE PLUNDERED AND LOOTED; THEY ARE ALL OF THEM TRAPPED IN HOLES AND HIDDEN IN PRISONS; THEY HAVE BECOME PLUNDER WITH NONE TO RESCUE SPOIL WITH NONE TO SAY RESTORE

 WHO AMONG YOU WILL GIVE EAR TO THIS WILL ATTEND AND LISTEN FOR THE TIME TO COME

WHO GAVE UP JACOB TO THE LOOTER AND ISRAEL TO THE PLUNDERERS

WAS IT NOT THE LORD AGAINST WHOM WE HAVE SINNED IN WHOSE WAYS THEY WOULD NOT WALK AND WHOSE LAW THEY WOULD NOT OBEY

SO HE POURED ON HIM THE HEAT OF HIS ANGER AND THE MIGHT OF BATTLE; IT SET HIM ON FIRE ALL AROUND BUT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND; IT BURNED HIM UP BUT HE DID NOT TAKE IT TO HEART

YOU ARE MY WITNESSES DECLARES THE LORD AND MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN THAT YOU MAY KNOW AND BELIEVE ME AND UNDERSTAND THAT I AM HE

BEFORE ME NO GOD WAS FORMED NOR SHALL THERE BE ANY AFTER ME

I I AM THE LORD AND BESIDES ME THERE IS NO SAVIOR

ALSO HENCEFORTH I AM HE; THERE IS NONE WHO CAN DELIVER FROM MY HAND; I WORK AND WHO CAN TURN IT BACK

 THUS SAYS THE LORD YOUR REDEEMER THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL FOR YOUR SAKE I SEND TO BABYLON AND BRING THEM ALL DOWN AS FUGITIVES EVEN THE CHALDEANS IN THE SHIPS IN WHICH THEY REJOICE

I AM THE LORD YOUR HOLY ONE THE CREATOR OF ISRAEL YOUR KING

 THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO MAKES A WAY IN THE SEA A PATH IN THE MIGHTY WATERS WHO BRINGS FORTH CHARIOT AND HORSE ARMY AND WARRIOR; THEY LIE DOWN THEY CANNOT RISE THEY ARE EXTINGUISHED QUENCHED LIKE A WICK REMEMBER NOT THE FORMER THINGS NOR CONSIDER THE THINGS OF OLD

BEHOLD I AM DOING A NEW THING; NOW IT SPRINGS FORTH DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE IT

I WILL MAKE A WAY IN THE WILDERNESS AND RIVERS IN THE DESERT

THE WILD BEASTS WILL HONOR ME THE JACKALS AND THE OSTRICHES FOR I GIVE WATER IN THE WILDERNESS RIVERS IN THE DESERT TO GIVE DRINK TO MY CHOSEN PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHOM I FORMED FOR MYSELF THAT THEY MIGHT DECLARE MY PRAISE

YET YOU DID NOT CALL UPON ME O JACOB; BUT YOU HAVE BEEN WEARY OF ME O ISRAEL

YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ME YOUR SHEEP FOR BURNT OFFERINGS OR HONORED ME WITH YOUR SACRIFICES

I HAVE NOT BURDENED YOU WITH OFFERINGS OR WEARIED YOU WITH FRANKINCENSE

YOU HAVE NOT BOUGHT ME SWEET CANE WITH MONEY OR SATISFIED ME WITH THE FAT OF YOUR SACRIFICES

BUT YOU HAVE BURDENED ME WITH YOUR SINS; YOU HAVE WEARIED ME WITH YOUR INIQUITIES

I I AM HE WHO BLOTS OUT YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS FOR MY OWN SAKE AND I WILL NOT REMEMBER YOUR SINS

PUT ME IN REMEMBRANCE; LET US ARGUE TOGETHER; SET FORTH YOUR CASE THAT YOU MAY BE PROVED RIGHT

YOUR FIRST FATHER SINNED AND YOUR MEDIATORS TRANSGRESSED AGAINST ME

THEREFORE I WILL PROFANE THE PRINCES OF THE SANCTUARY AND DELIVER JACOB TO UTTER DESTRUCTION AND ISRAEL TO REVILING

BUT NOW HEAR O JACOB MY SERVANT ISRAEL WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN

THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO MADE YOU WHO FORMED YOU FROM THE WOMB AND WILL HELP YOU FEAR NOT O JACOB MY SERVANT JESHURUN WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN

FOR I WILL POUR WATER ON THE THIRSTY LAND AND STREAMS ON THE DRY GROUND; I WILL POUR MY SPIRIT UPON YOUR OFFSPRING AND MY BLESSING ON YOUR DESCENDANTS

THEY SHALL SPRING UP AMONG THE GRASS LIKE WILLOWS BY FLOWING STREAMS

THIS ONE WILL SAY 'I AM THE LORD'S' ANOTHER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF JACOB AND ANOTHER WILL WRITE ON HIS HAND 'THE LORD'S' AND NAME HIMSELF BY THE NAME OF ISRAEL

 THUS SAYS THE LORD THE KING OF ISRAEL AND HIS REDEEMER THE LORD OF HOSTS I AM THE FIRST AND I AM THE LAST; BESIDES ME THERE IS NO GOD

WHO IS LIKE ME

LET HIM PROCLAIM IT

LET HIM DECLARE AND SET IT BEFORE ME SINCE I APPOINTED AN ANCIENT PEOPLE

LET THEM DECLARE WHAT IS TO COME AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN

FEAR NOT NOR BE AFRAID; HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU FROM OF OLD AND DECLARED IT

AND YOU ARE MY WITNESSES

IS THERE A GOD BESIDES ME

THERE IS NO ROCK; I KNOW NOT ANY

 ALL WHO FASHION IDOLS ARE NOTHING AND THE THINGS THEY DELIGHT IN DO NOT PROFIT

THEIR WITNESSES NEITHER SEE NOR KNOW THAT THEY MAY BE PUT TO SHAME

WHO FASHIONS A GOD OR CASTS AN IDOL THAT IS PROFITABLE FOR NOTHING

BEHOLD ALL HIS COMPANIONS SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME AND THE CRAFTSMEN ARE ONLY HUMAN

LET THEM ALL ASSEMBLE LET THEM STAND FORTH

THEY SHALL BE TERRIFIED; THEY SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME TOGETHER

THE IRONSMITH TAKES A CUTTING TOOL AND WORKS IT OVER THE COALS

HE FASHIONS IT WITH HAMMERS AND WORKS IT WITH HIS STRONG ARM

HE BECOMES HUNGRY AND HIS STRENGTH FAILS; HE DRINKS NO WATER AND IS FAINT

THE CARPENTER STRETCHES A LINE; HE MARKS IT OUT WITH A PENCIL

HE SHAPES IT WITH PLANES AND MARKS IT WITH A COMPASS

HE SHAPES IT INTO THE FIGURE OF A MAN WITH THE BEAUTY OF A MAN TO DWELL IN A HOUSE

HE CUTS DOWN CEDARS OR HE CHOOSES A CYPRESS TREE OR AN OAK AND LETS IT GROW STRONG AMONG THE TREES OF THE FOREST

HE PLANTS A CEDAR AND THE RAIN NOURISHES IT

THEN IT BECOMES FUEL FOR A MAN

HE TAKES A PART OF IT AND WARMS HIMSELF; HE KINDLES A FIRE AND BAKES BREAD

ALSO HE MAKES A GOD AND WORSHIPS IT; HE MAKES IT AN IDOL AND FALLS DOWN BEFORE IT

HALF OF IT HE BURNS IN THE FIRE

OVER THE HALF HE EATS MEAT; HE ROASTS IT AND IS SATISFIED

ALSO HE WARMS HIMSELF AND SAYS AHA I AM WARM I HAVE SEEN THE FIRE

 AND THE REST OF IT HE MAKES INTO A GOD HIS IDOL AND FALLS DOWN TO IT AND WORSHIPS IT

HE PRAYS TO IT AND SAYS DELIVER ME FOR YOU ARE MY GOD

 THEY KNOW NOT NOR DO THEY DISCERN FOR HE HAS SHUT THEIR EYES SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE AND THEIR HEARTS SO THAT THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND

NO ONE CONSIDERS NOR IS THERE KNOWLEDGE OR DISCERNMENT TO SAY HALF OF IT I BURNED IN THE FIRE; I ALSO BAKED BREAD ON ITS COALS; I ROASTED MEAT AND HAVE EATEN

AND SHALL I MAKE THE REST OF IT AN ABOMINATION

SHALL I FALL DOWN BEFORE A BLOCK OF WOOD

 HE FEEDS ON ASHES; A DELUDED HEART HAS LED HIM ASTRAY AND HE CANNOT DELIVER HIMSELF OR SAY IS THERE NOT A LIE IN MY RIGHT HAND

 REMEMBER THESE THINGS O JACOB AND ISRAEL FOR YOU ARE MY SERVANT; I FORMED YOU; YOU ARE MY SERVANT; O ISRAEL YOU WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY ME

I HAVE BLOTTED OUT YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS LIKE A CLOUD AND YOUR SINS LIKE MIST; RETURN TO ME FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU

SING O HEAVENS FOR THE LORD HAS DONE IT; SHOUT O DEPTHS OF THE EARTH; BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING O MOUNTAINS O FOREST AND EVERY TREE IN IT

FOR THE LORD HAS REDEEMED JACOB AND WILL BE GLORIFIED IN ISRAEL

THUS SAYS THE LORD YOUR REDEEMER WHO FORMED YOU FROM THE WOMB I AM THE LORD WHO MADE ALL THINGS WHO ALONE STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS WHO SPREAD OUT THE EARTH BY MYSELF WHO FRUSTRATES THE SIGNS OF LIARS AND MAKES FOOLS OF DIVINERS WHO TURNS WISE MEN BACK AND MAKES THEIR KNOWLEDGE FOOLISH WHO CONFIRMS THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT AND FULFILLS THE COUNSEL OF HIS MESSENGERS WHO SAYS OF JERUSALEM 'SHE SHALL BE INHABITED' AND OF THE CITIES OF JUDAH 'THEY SHALL BE BUILT AND I WILL RAISE UP THEIR RUINS'; WHO SAYS TO THE DEEP 'BE DRY; I WILL DRY UP YOUR RIVERS'; WHO SAYS OF CYRUS 'HE IS MY SHEPHERD AND HE SHALL FULFILL ALL MY PURPOSE'; SAYING OF JERUSALEM 'SHE SHALL BE BUILT' AND OF THE TEMPLE 'YOUR FOUNDATION SHALL BE LAID

FOR THE SAKE OF MY SERVANT JACOB AND ISRAEL MY CHOSEN I CALL YOU BY YOUR NAME I NAME YOU THOUGH YOU DO NOT KNOW ME

I AM THE LORD AND THERE IS NO OTHER BESIDES ME THERE IS NO GOD; I EQUIP YOU THOUGH YOU DO NOT KNOW ME THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN AND FROM THE WEST THAT THERE IS NONE BESIDES ME; I AM THE LORD AND THERE IS NO OTHER

I FORM LIGHT AND CREATE DARKNESS I MAKE WELLBEING AND CREATE CALAMITY I AM THE LORD WHO DOES ALL THESE THINGS

SHOWER O HEAVENS FROM ABOVE AND LET THE CLOUDS RAIN DOWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; LET THE EARTH OPEN THAT SALVATION AND RIGHTEOUSNESS MAY BEAR FRUIT; LET THE EARTH CAUSE THEM BOTH TO SPROUT; I THE LORD HAVE CREATED IT

WOE TO HIM WHO STRIVES WITH HIM WHO FORMED HIM A POT AMONG EARTHEN POTS

DOES THE CLAY SAY TO HIM WHO FORMS IT 'WHAT ARE YOU MAKING

' OR 'YOUR WORK HAS NO HANDLES'

WOE TO HIM WHO SAYS TO A FATHER 'WHAT ARE YOU BEGETTING

' OR TO A WOMAN 'WITH WHAT ARE YOU IN LABOR

' THUS SAYS THE LORD THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL AND THE ONE WHO FORMED HIM ASK ME OF THINGS TO COME; WILL YOU COMMAND ME CONCERNING MY CHILDREN AND THE WORK OF MY HANDS

I MADE THE EARTH AND CREATED MAN ON IT; IT WAS MY HANDS THAT STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS AND I COMMANDED ALL THEIR HOST

I HAVE STIRRED HIM UP IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND I WILL MAKE ALL HIS WAYS LEVEL; HE SHALL BUILD MY CITY AND SET MY EXILES FREE NOT FOR PRICE OR REWARD SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

THUS SAYS THE LORD THE WEALTH OF EGYPT AND THE MERCHANDISE OF CUSH AND THE SABEANS MEN OF STATURE SHALL COME OVER TO YOU AND BE YOURS; THEY SHALL FOLLOW YOU; THEY SHALL COME OVER IN CHAINS AND BOW DOWN TO YOU

THEY WILL PLEAD WITH YOU SAYING 'SURELY GOD IS IN YOU AND THERE IS NO OTHER NO GOD BESIDES HIM

' TRULY YOU ARE A GOD WHO HIDES YOURSELF O GOD OF ISRAEL THE SAVIOR

ALL OF THEM ARE PUT TO SHAME AND CONFOUNDED; THE MAKERS OF IDOLS GO IN CONFUSION TOGETHER

BUT ISRAEL IS SAVED BY THE LORD WITH EVERLASTING SALVATION; YOU SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME OR CONFOUNDED TO ALL ETERNITY

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS HE IS GOD

 WHO FORMED THE EARTH AND MADE IT HE ESTABLISHED IT; HE DID NOT CREATE IT EMPTY HE FORMED IT TO BE INHABITED

 I AM THE LORD AND THERE IS NO OTHER

I DID NOT SPEAK IN SECRET IN A LAND OF DARKNESS; I DID NOT SAY TO THE OFFSPRING OF JACOB 'SEEK ME IN VAIN

' I THE LORD SPEAK THE TRUTH; I DECLARE WHAT IS RIGHT

ASSEMBLE YOURSELVES AND COME; DRAW NEAR TOGETHER YOU SURVIVORS OF THE NATIONS

THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE WHO CARRY ABOUT THEIR WOODEN IDOLS AND KEEP ON PRAYING TO A GOD THAT CANNOT SAVE

DECLARE AND PRESENT YOUR CASE; LET THEM TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER

WHO TOLD THIS LONG AGO

WHO DECLARED IT OF OLD

WAS IT NOT I THE LORD

AND THERE IS NO OTHER GOD BESIDES ME A RIGHTEOUS GOD AND A SAVIOR; THERE IS NONE BESIDES ME

TURN TO ME AND BE SAVED ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

FOR I AM GOD AND THERE IS NO OTHER

BY MYSELF I HAVE SWORN; FROM MY MOUTH HAS GONE OUT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS A WORD THAT SHALL NOT RETURN 'TO ME EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW EVERY TONGUE SHALL SWEAR ALLEGIANCE

' ONLY IN THE LORD IT SHALL BE SAID OF ME ARE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND STRENGTH; TO HIM SHALL COME AND BE ASHAMED ALL WHO WERE INCENSED AGAINST HIM

IN THE LORD ALL THE OFFSPRING OF ISRAEL SHALL BE JUSTIFIED AND SHALL GLORY

BEL BOWS DOWN; NEBO STOOPS; THEIR IDOLS ARE ON BEASTS AND LIVESTOCK; THESE THINGS YOU CARRY ARE BORNE AS BURDENS ON WEARY BEASTS

THEY STOOP; THEY BOW DOWN TOGETHER; THEY CANNOT SAVE THE BURDEN BUT THEMSELVES GO INTO CAPTIVITY

LISTEN TO ME O HOUSE OF JACOB ALL THE REMNANT OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WHO HAVE BEEN BORNE BY ME FROM BEFORE YOUR BIRTH CARRIED FROM THE WOMB; EVEN TO YOUR OLD AGE I AM HE AND TO GRAY HAIRS I WILL CARRY YOU

I HAVE MADE AND I WILL BEAR; I WILL CARRY AND WILL SAVE

TO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME AND MAKE ME EQUAL AND COMPARE ME THAT WE MAY BE ALIKE

THOSE WHO LAVISH GOLD FROM THE PURSE AND WEIGH OUT SILVER IN THE SCALES HIRE A GOLDSMITH AND HE MAKES IT INTO A GOD; THEN THEY FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP

THEY LIFT IT TO THEIR SHOULDERS THEY CARRY IT THEY SET IT IN ITS PLACE AND IT STANDS THERE; IT CANNOT MOVE FROM ITS PLACE

IF ONE CRIES TO IT IT DOES NOT ANSWER OR SAVE HIM FROM HIS TROUBLE

REMEMBER THIS AND STAND FIRM RECALL IT TO MIND YOU TRANSGRESSORS REMEMBER THE FORMER THINGS OF OLD; FOR I AM GOD AND THERE IS NO OTHER; I AM GOD AND THERE IS NONE LIKE ME DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING AND FROM ANCIENT TIMES THINGS NOT YET DONE SAYING 'MY COUNSEL SHALL STAND AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY PURPOSE' CALLING A BIRD OF PREY FROM THE EAST THE MAN OF MY COUNSEL FROM A FAR COUNTRY

I HAVE SPOKEN AND I WILL BRING IT TO PASS; I HAVE PURPOSED AND I WILL DO IT

YOUR NAKEDNESS SHALL BE UNCOVERED AND YOUR DISGRACE SHALL BE SEEN

I WILL TAKE VENGEANCE AND I WILL SPARE NO ONE

OUR REDEEMERTHE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAMEIS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

SIT IN SILENCE AND GO INTO DARKNESS O DAUGHTER OF THE CHALDEANS; FOR YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED THE MISTRESS OF KINGDOMS

I WAS ANGRY WITH MY PEOPLE; I PROFANED MY HERITAGE; I GAVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND; YOU SHOWED THEM NO MERCY; ON THE AGED YOU MADE YOUR YOKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY

YOU SAID I SHALL BE MISTRESS FOREVER SO THAT YOU DID NOT LAY THESE THINGS TO HEART OR REMEMBER THEIR END

NOW THEREFORE HEAR THIS YOU LOVER OF PLEASURES WHO SIT SECURELY WHO SAY IN YOUR HEART I AM AND THERE IS NO ONE BESIDES ME; I SHALL NOT SIT AS A WIDOW OR KNOW THE LOSS OF CHILDREN THESE TWO THINGS SHALL COME TO YOU IN A MOMENT IN ONE DAY; THE LOSS OF CHILDREN AND WIDOWHOOD SHALL COME UPON YOU IN FULL MEASURE IN SPITE OF YOUR MANY SORCERIES AND THE GREAT POWER OF YOUR ENCHANTMENTS

YOU FELT SECURE IN YOUR WICKEDNESS YOU SAID NO ONE SEES ME; YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE LED YOU ASTRAY AND YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART I AM AND THERE IS NO ONE BESIDES ME

 BUT EVIL SHALL COME UPON YOU WHICH YOU WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO CHARM AWAY; DISASTER SHALL FALL UPON YOU FOR WHICH YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ATONE; AND RUIN SHALL COME UPON YOU SUDDENLY OF WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING

STAND FAST IN YOUR ENCHANTMENTS AND YOUR MANY SORCERIES WITH WHICH YOU HAVE LABORED FROM YOUR YOUTH; PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SUCCEED; PERHAPS YOU MAY INSPIRE TERROR

YOU ARE WEARIED WITH YOUR MANY COUNSELS; LET THEM STAND FORTH AND SAVE YOU THOSE WHO DIVIDE THE HEAVENS WHO GAZE AT THE STARS WHO AT THE NEW MOONS MAKE KNOWN WHAT SHALL COME UPON YOU

BEHOLD THEY ARE LIKE STUBBLE; THE FIRE CONSUMES THEM; THEY CANNOT DELIVER THEMSELVES FROM THE POWER OF THE FLAME

NO COAL FOR WARMING ONESELF IS THIS NO FIRE TO SIT BEFORE

SUCH TO YOU ARE THOSE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE LABORED WHO HAVE DONE BUSINESS WITH YOU FROM YOUR YOUTH; THEY WANDER ABOUT EACH IN HIS OWN DIRECTION; THERE IS NO ONE TO SAVE YOU

HEAR THIS O HOUSE OF JACOB WHO ARE CALLED BY THE NAME OF ISRAEL AND WHO CAME FROM THE WATERS OF JUDAH WHO SWEAR BY THE NAME OF THE LORD AND CONFESS THE GOD OF ISRAEL BUT NOT IN TRUTH OR RIGHT

FOR THEY CALL THEMSELVES AFTER THE HOLY CITY AND STAY THEMSELVES ON THE GOD OF ISRAEL; THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME

THE FORMER THINGS I DECLARED OF OLD; THEY WENT OUT FROM MY MOUTH AND I ANNOUNCED THEM; THEN SUDDENLY I DID THEM AND THEY CAME TO PASS

BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE OBSTINATE AND YOUR NECK IS AN IRON SINEW AND YOUR FOREHEAD BRASS I DECLARED THEM TO YOU FROM OF OLD BEFORE THEY CAME TO PASS I ANNOUNCED THEM TO YOU LEST YOU SHOULD SAY 'MY IDOL DID THEM MY CARVED IMAGE AND MY METAL IMAGE COMMANDED THEM

' YOU HAVE HEARD; NOW SEE ALL THIS; AND WILL YOU NOT DECLARE IT

THEY ARE CREATED NOW NOT LONG AGO; BEFORE TODAY YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THEM LEST YOU SHOULD SAY 'BEHOLD I KNEW THEM

' YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN FROM OF OLD YOUR EAR HAS NOT BEEN OPENED

FOR I KNEW THAT YOU WOULD SURELY DEAL TREACHEROUSLY AND THAT FROM BEFORE BIRTH YOU WERE CALLED A REBEL

FOR MY NAME'S SAKE I DEFER MY ANGER FOR THE SAKE OF MY PRAISE I RESTRAIN IT FOR YOU THAT I MAY NOT CUT YOU OFF

BEHOLD I HAVE REFINED YOU BUT NOT AS SILVER; I HAVE TRIED YOU IN THE FURNACE OF AFFLICTION

FOR MY OWN SAKE FOR MY OWN SAKE I DO IT FOR HOW SHOULD MY NAME BE PROFANED

MY GLORY I WILL NOT GIVE TO ANOTHER

LISTEN TO ME O JACOB AND ISRAEL WHOM I CALLED

I AM HE; I AM THE FIRST AND I AM THE LAST

MY HAND LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH AND MY RIGHT HAND SPREAD OUT THE HEAVENS; WHEN I CALL TO THEM THEY STAND FORTH TOGETHER

ASSEMBLE ALL OF YOU AND LISTEN

WHO AMONG THEM HAS DECLARED THESE THINGS

THE LORD LOVES HIM; HE SHALL PERFORM HIS PURPOSE ON BABYLON AND HIS ARM SHALL BE AGAINST THE CHALDEANS

I EVEN I HAVE SPOKEN AND CALLED HIM; I HAVE BROUGHT HIM AND HE WILL PROSPER IN HIS WAY

DRAW NEAR TO ME HEAR THIS FROM THE BEGINNING I HAVE NOT SPOKEN IN SECRET FROM THE TIME IT CAME TO BE I HAVE BEEN THERE

 AND NOW THE LORD GOD HAS SENT ME AND HIS SPIRIT

THUS SAYS THE LORD YOUR REDEEMER THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO TEACHES YOU TO PROFIT WHO LEADS YOU IN THE WAY YOU SHOULD GO

OH THAT YOU HAD PAID ATTENTION TO MY COMMANDMENTS

THEN YOUR PEACE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A RIVER AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE THE WAVES OF THE SEA; YOUR OFFSPRING WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THE SAND AND YOUR DESCENDANTS LIKE ITS GRAINS; THEIR NAME WOULD NEVER BE CUT OFF OR DESTROYED FROM BEFORE ME

 GO OUT FROM BABYLON FLEE FROM CHALDEA DECLARE THIS WITH A SHOUT OF JOY PROCLAIM IT SEND IT OUT TO THE END OF THE EARTH; SAY THE LORD HAS REDEEMED HIS SERVANT JACOB

 THEY DID NOT THIRST WHEN HE LED THEM THROUGH THE DESERTS; HE MADE WATER FLOW FOR THEM FROM THE ROCK; HE SPLIT THE ROCK AND THE WATER GUSHED OUT

THERE IS NO PEACE SAYS THE LORD FOR THE WICKED

LISTEN TO ME O COASTLANDS AND GIVE ATTENTION YOU PEOPLES FROM AFAR

THE LORD CALLED ME FROM THE WOMB FROM THE BODY OF MY MOTHER HE NAMED MY NAME

HE MADE MY MOUTH LIKE A SHARP SWORD; IN THE SHADOW OF HIS HAND HE HID ME; HE MADE ME A POLISHED ARROW; IN HIS QUIVER HE HID ME AWAY

AND HE SAID TO ME YOU ARE MY SERVANT ISRAEL IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED

 BUT I SAID I HAVE LABORED IN VAIN; I HAVE SPENT MY STRENGTH FOR NOTHING AND VANITY; YET SURELY MY RIGHT IS WITH THE LORD AND MY RECOMPENSE WITH MY GOD

 AND NOW THE LORD SAYS HE WHO FORMED ME FROM THE WOMB TO BE HIS SERVANT TO BRING JACOB BACK TO HIM; AND THAT ISRAEL MIGHT BE GATHERED TO HIMFOR I AM HONORED IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND MY GOD HAS BECOME MY STRENGTH HE SAYS IT IS TOO LIGHT A THING THAT YOU SHOULD BE MY SERVANT TO RAISE UP THE TRIBES OF JACOB AND TO BRING BACK THE PRESERVED OF ISRAEL; I WILL MAKE YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE NATIONS THAT MY SALVATION MAY REACH TO THE END OF THE EARTH

 THUS SAYS THE LORD THE REDEEMER OF ISRAEL AND HIS HOLY ONE TO ONE DEEPLY DESPISED ABHORRED BY THE NATION THE SERVANT OF RULERS KINGS SHALL SEE AND ARISE; PRINCES AND THEY SHALL PROSTRATE THEMSELVES; BECAUSE OF THE LORD WHO IS FAITHFUL THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL WHO HAS CHOSEN YOU

 THUS SAYS THE LORD IN A TIME OF FAVOR I HAVE ANSWERED YOU; IN A DAY OF SALVATION I HAVE HELPED YOU; I WILL KEEP YOU AND GIVE YOU AS A COVENANT TO THE PEOPLE TO ESTABLISH THE LAND TO APPORTION THE DESOLATE HERITAGES SAYING TO THE PRISONERS 'COME OUT' TO THOSE WHO ARE IN DARKNESS 'APPEAR

' THEY SHALL FEED ALONG THE WAYS; ON ALL BARE HEIGHTS SHALL BE THEIR PASTURE; THEY SHALL NOT HUNGER OR THIRST NEITHER SCORCHING WIND NOR SUN SHALL STRIKE THEM FOR HE WHO HAS PITY ON THEM WILL LEAD THEM AND BY SPRINGS OF WATER WILL GUIDE THEM

AND I WILL MAKE ALL MY MOUNTAINS A ROAD AND MY HIGHWAYS SHALL BE RAISED UP

BEHOLD THESE SHALL COME FROM AFAR AND BEHOLD THESE FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE WEST AND THESE FROM THE LAND OF SYENE

 SING FOR JOY O HEAVENS AND EXULT O EARTH; BREAK FORTH O MOUNTAINS INTO SINGING

FOR THE LORD HAS COMFORTED HIS PEOPLE AND WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON HIS AFFLICTED

BUT ZION SAID THE LORD HAS FORSAKEN ME; MY LORD HAS FORGOTTEN ME

 CAN A WOMAN FORGET HER NURSING CHILD THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE NO COMPASSION ON THE SON OF HER WOMB

EVEN THESE MAY FORGET YET I WILL NOT FORGET YOU

BEHOLD I HAVE ENGRAVED YOU ON THE PALMS OF MY HANDS; YOUR WALLS ARE CONTINUALLY BEFORE ME

YOUR BUILDERS MAKE HASTE; YOUR DESTROYERS AND THOSE WHO LAID YOU WASTE GO OUT FROM YOU

LIFT UP YOUR EYES AROUND AND SEE; THEY ALL GATHER THEY COME TO YOU

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD YOU SHALL PUT THEM ALL ON AS AN ORNAMENT; YOU SHALL BIND THEM ON AS A BRIDE DOES

SURELY YOUR WASTE AND YOUR DESOLATE PLACES AND YOUR DEVASTATED LANDSURELY NOW YOU WILL BE TOO NARROW FOR YOUR INHABITANTS AND THOSE WHO SWALLOWED YOU UP WILL BE FAR AWAY

THE CHILDREN OF YOUR BEREAVEMENT WILL YET SAY IN YOUR EARS 'THE PLACE IS TOO NARROW FOR ME; MAKE ROOM FOR ME TO DWELL IN

' THEN YOU WILL SAY IN YOUR HEART 'WHO HAS BORNE ME THESE

I WAS BEREAVED AND BARREN EXILED AND PUT AWAY BUT WHO HAS BROUGHT UP THESE

BEHOLD I WAS LEFT ALONE; FROM WHERE HAVE THESE COME

' THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL LIFT UP MY HAND TO THE NATIONS AND RAISE MY SIGNAL TO THE PEOPLES; AND THEY SHALL BRING YOUR SONS IN THEIR BOSOM AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL BE CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS

KINGS SHALL BE YOUR FOSTER FATHERS AND THEIR QUEENS YOUR NURSING MOTHERS

WITH THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND THEY SHALL BOW DOWN TO YOU AND LICK THE DUST OF YOUR FEET

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; THOSE WHO WAIT FOR ME SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME

 CAN THE PREY BE TAKEN FROM THE MIGHTY OR THE CAPTIVES OF A TYRANT BE RESCUED

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD EVEN THE CAPTIVES OF THE MIGHTY SHALL BE TAKEN AND THE PREY OF THE TYRANT BE RESCUED FOR I WILL CONTEND WITH THOSE WHO CONTEND WITH YOU AND I WILL SAVE YOUR CHILDREN

I WILL MAKE YOUR OPPRESSORS EAT THEIR OWN FLESH AND THEY SHALL BE DRUNK WITH THEIR OWN BLOOD AS WITH WINE

THEN ALL FLESH SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR SAVIOR AND YOUR REDEEMER THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB

THUS SAYS THE LORD WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER'S CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE WITH WHICH I SENT HER AWAY

OR WHICH OF MY CREDITORS IS IT TO WHOM I HAVE SOLD YOU

BEHOLD FOR YOUR INIQUITIES YOU WERE SOLD AND FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS YOUR MOTHER WAS SENT AWAY

WHY WHEN I CAME WAS THERE NO MAN; WHY WHEN I CALLED WAS THERE NO ONE TO ANSWER

IS MY HAND SHORTENED THAT IT CANNOT REDEEM

OR HAVE I NO POWER TO DELIVER

BEHOLD BY MY REBUKE I DRY UP THE SEA I MAKE THE RIVERS A DESERT; THEIR FISH STINK FOR LACK OF WATER AND DIE OF THIRST

I CLOTHE THE HEAVENS WITH BLACKNESS AND MAKE SACKCLOTH THEIR COVERING

 THE LORD GOD HAS GIVEN ME THE TONGUE OF THOSE WHO ARE TAUGHT THAT I MAY KNOW HOW TO SUSTAIN WITH A WORD HIM WHO IS WEARY

MORNING BY MORNING HE AWAKENS; HE AWAKENS MY EAR TO HEAR AS THOSE WHO ARE TAUGHT

THE LORD GOD HAS OPENED MY EAR AND I WAS NOT REBELLIOUS; I TURNED NOT BACKWARD

I GAVE MY BACK TO THOSE WHO STRIKE AND MY CHEEKS TO THOSE WHO PULL OUT THE BEARD; I HID NOT MY FACE FROM DISGRACE AND SPITTING

BUT THE LORD GOD HELPS ME; THEREFORE I HAVE NOT BEEN DISGRACED; THEREFORE I HAVE SET MY FACE LIKE A FLINT AND I KNOW THAT I SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME

HE WHO VINDICATES ME IS NEAR

WHO WILL CONTEND WITH ME

LET US STAND UP TOGETHER

WHO IS MY ADVERSARY

LET HIM COME NEAR TO ME

BEHOLD THE LORD GOD HELPS ME; WHO WILL DECLARE ME GUILTY

BEHOLD ALL OF THEM WILL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT; THE MOTH WILL EAT THEM UP

WHO AMONG YOU FEARS THE LORD AND OBEYS THE VOICE OF HIS SERVANT

LET HIM WHO WALKS IN DARKNESS AND HAS NO LIGHT TRUST IN THE NAME OF THE LORD AND RELY ON HIS GOD

BEHOLD ALL YOU WHO KINDLE A FIRE WHO EQUIP YOURSELVES WITH BURNING TORCHES

WALK BY THE LIGHT OF YOUR FIRE AND BY THE TORCHES THAT YOU HAVE KINDLED

THIS YOU HAVE FROM MY HAND YOU SHALL LIE DOWN IN TORMENT

LISTEN TO ME YOU WHO PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS YOU WHO SEEK THE LORD LOOK TO THE ROCK FROM WHICH YOU WERE HEWN AND TO THE QUARRY FROM WHICH YOU WERE DUG

LOOK TO ABRAHAM YOUR FATHER AND TO SARAH WHO BORE YOU; FOR HE WAS BUT ONE WHEN I CALLED HIM THAT I MIGHT BLESS HIM AND MULTIPLY HIM

FOR THE LORD COMFORTS ZION; HE COMFORTS ALL HER WASTE PLACES AND MAKES HER WILDERNESS LIKE EDEN HER DESERT LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD; JOY AND GLADNESS WILL BE FOUND IN HER THANKSGIVING AND THE VOICE OF SONG

GIVE ATTENTION TO ME MY PEOPLE AND GIVE EAR TO ME MY NATION; FOR A LAW WILL GO OUT FROM ME AND I WILL SET MY JUSTICE FOR A LIGHT TO THE PEOPLES

MY RIGHTEOUSNESS DRAWS NEAR MY SALVATION HAS GONE OUT AND MY ARMS WILL JUDGE THE PEOPLES; THE COASTLANDS HOPE FOR ME AND FOR MY ARM THEY WAIT

LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO THE HEAVENS AND LOOK AT THE EARTH BENEATH; FOR THE HEAVENS VANISH LIKE SMOKE THE EARTH WILL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT AND THEY WHO DWELL IN IT WILL DIE IN LIKE MANNER; BUT MY SALVATION WILL BE FOREVER AND MY RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL NEVER BE DISMAYED

LISTEN TO ME YOU WHO KNOW RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PEOPLE IN WHOSE HEART IS MY LAW; FEAR NOT THE REPROACH OF MAN NOR BE DISMAYED AT THEIR REVILINGS

FOR THE MOTH WILL EAT THEM UP LIKE A GARMENT AND THE WORM WILL EAT THEM LIKE WOOL; BUT MY RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BE FOREVER AND MY SALVATION TO ALL GENERATIONS

 AWAKE AWAKE PUT ON STRENGTH O ARM OF THE LORD; AWAKE AS IN DAYS OF OLD THE GENERATIONS OF LONG AGO

WAS IT NOT YOU WHO CUT RAHAB IN PIECES THAT PIERCED THE DRAGON

WAS IT NOT YOU WHO DRIED UP THE SEA THE WATERS OF THE GREAT DEEP WHO MADE THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A WAY FOR THE REDEEMED TO PASS OVER

AND THE RANSOMED OF THE LORD SHALL RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH SINGING; EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UPON THEIR HEADS; THEY SHALL OBTAIN GLADNESS AND JOY AND SORROW AND SIGHING SHALL FLEE AWAY

I I AM HE WHO COMFORTS YOU; WHO ARE YOU THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF MAN WHO DIES OF THE SON OF MAN WHO IS MADE LIKE GRASS AND HAVE FORGOTTEN THE LORD YOUR MAKER WHO STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH AND YOU FEAR CONTINUALLY ALL THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE WRATH OF THE OPPRESSOR WHEN HE SETS HIMSELF TO DESTROY

AND WHERE IS THE WRATH OF THE OPPRESSOR

HE WHO IS BOWED DOWN SHALL SPEEDILY BE RELEASED; HE SHALL NOT DIE AND GO DOWN TO THE PIT NEITHER SHALL HIS BREAD BE LACKING

I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO STIRS UP THE SEA SO THAT ITS WAVES ROARTHE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME

AND I HAVE PUT MY WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH AND COVERED YOU IN THE SHADOW OF MY HAND ESTABLISHING THE HEAVENS AND LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH AND SAYING TO ZION 'YOU ARE MY PEOPLE

' WAKE YOURSELF WAKE YOURSELF STAND UP O JERUSALEM YOU WHO HAVE DRUNK FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD THE CUP OF HIS WRATH WHO HAVE DRUNK TO THE DREGS THE BOWL THE CUP OF STAGGERING

THESE TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO YOUWHO WILL CONSOLE YOU

DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION FAMINE AND SWORD; WHO WILL COMFORT YOU

YOUR SONS HAVE FAINTED; THEY LIE AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET LIKE AN ANTELOPE IN A NET; THEY ARE FULL OF THE WRATH OF THE LORD THE REBUKE OF YOUR GOD

THEREFORE HEAR THIS YOU WHO ARE AFFLICTED WHO ARE DRUNK BUT NOT WITH WINE THUS SAYS YOUR LORD THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO PLEADS THE CAUSE OF HIS PEOPLE BEHOLD I HAVE TAKEN FROM YOUR HAND THE CUP OF STAGGERING; THE BOWL OF MY WRATH YOU SHALL DRINK NO MORE; AND I WILL PUT IT INTO THE HAND OF YOUR TORMENTORS WHO HAVE SAID TO YOU 'BOW DOWN THAT WE MAY PASS OVER'; AND YOU HAVE MADE YOUR BACK LIKE THE GROUND AND LIKE THE STREET FOR THEM TO PASS OVER

AWAKE AWAKE PUT ON YOUR STRENGTH O ZION; PUT ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL GARMENTS O JERUSALEM THE HOLY CITY; FOR THERE SHALL NO MORE COME INTO YOU THE UNCIRCUMCISED AND THE UNCLEAN

SHAKE YOURSELF FROM THE DUST AND ARISE; BE SEATED O JERUSALEM; LOOSE THE BONDS FROM YOUR NECK O CAPTIVE DAUGHTER OF ZION

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU WERE SOLD FOR NOTHING AND YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED WITHOUT MONEY

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD MY PEOPLE WENT DOWN AT THE FIRST INTO EGYPT TO SOJOURN THERE AND THE ASSYRIAN OPPRESSED THEM FOR NOTHING

NOW THEREFORE WHAT HAVE I HERE DECLARES THE LORD SEEING THAT MY PEOPLE ARE TAKEN AWAY FOR NOTHING

THEIR RULERS WAIL DECLARES THE LORD AND CONTINUALLY ALL THE DAY MY NAME IS DESPISED

THEREFORE MY PEOPLE SHALL KNOW MY NAME

THEREFORE IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL KNOW THAT IT IS I WHO SPEAK; HERE AM I

DEPART DEPART GO OUT FROM THERE; TOUCH NO UNCLEAN THING; GO OUT FROM THE MIDST OF HER; PURIFY YOURSELVES YOU WHO BEAR THE VESSELS OF THE LORD

FOR YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT IN HASTE AND YOU SHALL NOT GO IN FLIGHT FOR THE LORD WILL GO BEFORE YOU AND THE GOD OF ISRAEL WILL BE YOUR REAR GUARD

BEHOLD MY SERVANT SHALL ACT WISELY; HE SHALL BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP AND SHALL BE EXALTED

AS MANY WERE ASTONISHED AT YOUHIS APPEARANCE WAS SO MARRED BEYOND HUMAN SEMBLANCE AND HIS FORM BEYOND THAT OF THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND SO SHALL HE SPRINKLE MANY NATIONS; KINGS SHALL SHUT THEIR MOUTHS BECAUSE OF HIM; FOR THAT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN TOLD THEM THEY SEE AND THAT WHICH THEY HAVE NOT HEARD THEY UNDERSTAND

WHO HAS BELIEVED WHAT THEY HEARD FROM US

AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED

FOR HE GREW UP BEFORE HIM LIKE A YOUNG PLANT AND LIKE A ROOT OUT OF DRY GROUND; HE HAD NO FORM OR MAJESTY THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT HIM AND NO BEAUTY THAT WE SHOULD DESIRE HIM

HE WAS DESPISED AND REJECTED BY MEN; A MAN OF SORROWS AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF; AND AS ONE FROM WHOM MEN HIDE THEIR FACES HE WAS DESPISED AND WE ESTEEMED HIM NOT

SURELY HE HAS BORNE OUR GRIEFS AND CARRIED OUR SORROWS; YET WE ESTEEMED HIM STRICKEN SMITTEN BY GOD AND AFFLICTED

BUT HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS; HE WAS CRUSHED FOR OUR INIQUITIES; UPON HIM WAS THE CHASTISEMENT THAT BROUGHT US PEACE AND WITH HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED

ALL WE LIKE SHEEP HAVE GONE ASTRAY; WE HAVE TURNED EVERY ONE TO HIS OWN WAY; AND THE LORD HAS LAID ON HIM THE INIQUITY OF US ALL

HE WAS OPPRESSED AND HE WAS AFFLICTED YET HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH; LIKE A LAMB THAT IS LED TO THE SLAUGHTER AND LIKE A SHEEP THAT BEFORE ITS SHEARERS IS SILENT SO HE OPENED NOT HIS MOUTH

BY OPPRESSION AND JUDGMENT HE WAS TAKEN AWAY; AND AS FOR HIS GENERATION WHO CONSIDERED THAT HE WAS CUT OFF OUT OF THE LAND OF THE LIVING STRICKEN FOR THE TRANSGRESSION OF MY PEOPLE

AND THEY MADE HIS GRAVE WITH THE WICKED AND WITH A RICH MAN IN HIS DEATH ALTHOUGH HE HAD DONE NO VIOLENCE AND THERE WAS NO DECEIT IN HIS MOUTH

YET IT WAS THE WILL OF THE LORD TO CRUSH HIM; HE HAS PUT HIM TO GRIEF; WHEN HIS SOUL MAKES AN OFFERING FOR SIN HE SHALL SEE HIS OFFSPRING; HE SHALL PROLONG HIS DAYS; THE WILL OF THE LORD SHALL PROSPER IN HIS HAND

OUT OF THE ANGUISH OF HIS SOUL HE SHALL SEE AND BE SATISFIED; BY HIS KNOWLEDGE SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS ONE MY SERVANT MAKE MANY TO BE ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUS AND HE SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITIES

THEREFORE I WILL DIVIDE HIM A PORTION WITH THE MANY AND HE SHALL DIVIDE THE SPOIL WITH THE STRONG BECAUSE HE POURED OUT HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND WAS NUMBERED WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS; YET HE BORE THE SIN OF MANY AND MAKES INTERCESSION FOR THE TRANSGRESSORS

SING O BARREN ONE WHO DID NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING AND CRY ALOUD YOU WHO HAVE NOT BEEN IN LABOR

FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE ONE WILL BE MORE THAN THE CHILDREN OF HER WHO IS MARRIED SAYS THE LORD

ENLARGE THE PLACE OF YOUR TENT AND LET THE CURTAINS OF YOUR HABITATIONS BE STRETCHED OUT; DO NOT HOLD BACK; LENGTHEN YOUR CORDS AND STRENGTHEN YOUR STAKES

FOR YOU WILL SPREAD ABROAD TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT AND YOUR OFFSPRING WILL POSSESS THE NATIONS AND WILL PEOPLE THE DESOLATE CITIES

FEAR NOT FOR YOU WILL NOT BE ASHAMED; BE NOT CONFOUNDED FOR YOU WILL NOT BE DISGRACED; FOR YOU WILL FORGET THE SHAME OF YOUR YOUTH AND THE REPROACH OF YOUR WIDOWHOOD YOU WILL REMEMBER NO MORE

FOR YOUR MAKER IS YOUR HUSBAND THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME; AND THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL IS YOUR REDEEMER THE GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH HE IS CALLED

FOR THE LORD HAS CALLED YOU LIKE A WIFE DESERTED AND GRIEVED IN SPIRIT LIKE A WIFE OF YOUTH WHEN SHE IS CAST OFF SAYS YOUR GOD

FOR A BRIEF MOMENT I DESERTED YOU BUT WITH GREAT COMPASSION I WILL GATHER YOU

IN OVERFLOWING ANGER FOR A MOMENT I HID MY FACE FROM YOU BUT WITH EVERLASTING LOVE I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON YOU SAYS THE LORD YOUR REDEEMER

THIS IS LIKE THE DAYS OF NOAH TO ME AS I SWORE THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH SHOULD NO MORE GO OVER THE EARTH SO I HAVE SWORN THAT I WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND WILL NOT REBUKE YOU

FOR THE MOUNTAINS MAY DEPART AND THE HILLS BE REMOVED BUT MY STEADFAST LOVE SHALL NOT DEPART FROM YOU AND MY COVENANT OF PEACE SHALL NOT BE REMOVED SAYS THE LORD WHO HAS COMPASSION ON YOU

O AFFLICTED ONE STORMTOSSED AND NOT COMFORTED BEHOLD I WILL SET YOUR STONES IN ANTIMONY AND LAY YOUR FOUNDATIONS WITH SAPPHIRES

I WILL MAKE YOUR PINNACLES OF AGATE YOUR GATES OF CARBUNCLES AND ALL YOUR WALL OF PRECIOUS STONES

ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD AND GREAT SHALL BE THE PEACE OF YOUR CHILDREN

IN RIGHTEOUSNESS YOU SHALL BE ESTABLISHED; YOU SHALL BE FAR FROM OPPRESSION FOR YOU SHALL NOT FEAR; AND FROM TERROR FOR IT SHALL NOT COME NEAR YOU

IF ANYONE STIRS UP STRIFE IT IS NOT FROM ME; WHOEVER STIRS UP STRIFE WITH YOU SHALL FALL BECAUSE OF YOU

BEHOLD I HAVE CREATED THE SMITH WHO BLOWS THE FIRE OF COALS AND PRODUCES A WEAPON FOR ITS PURPOSE

I HAVE ALSO CREATED THE RAVAGER TO DESTROY; NO WEAPON THAT IS FASHIONED AGAINST YOU SHALL SUCCEED AND YOU SHALL CONFUTE EVERY TONGUE THAT RISES AGAINST YOU IN JUDGMENT

THIS IS THE HERITAGE OF THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD AND THEIR VINDICATION FROM ME DECLARES THE LORD

COME EVERYONE WHO THIRSTS COME TO THE WATERS; AND HE WHO HAS NO MONEY COME BUY AND EAT

COME BUY WINE AND MILK WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE

WHY DO YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY FOR THAT WHICH IS NOT BREAD AND YOUR LABOR FOR THAT WHICH DOES NOT SATISFY

LISTEN DILIGENTLY TO ME AND EAT WHAT IS GOOD AND DELIGHT YOURSELVES IN RICH FOOD

INCLINE YOUR EAR AND COME TO ME; HEAR THAT YOUR SOUL MAY LIVE; AND I WILL MAKE WITH YOU AN EVERLASTING COVENANT MY STEADFAST SURE LOVE FOR DAVID

BEHOLD I MADE HIM A WITNESS TO THE PEOPLES A LEADER AND COMMANDER FOR THE PEOPLES

BEHOLD YOU SHALL CALL A NATION THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW AND A NATION THAT DID NOT KNOW YOU SHALL RUN TO YOU BECAUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL FOR HE HAS GLORIFIED YOU

SEEK THE LORD WHILE HE MAY BE FOUND; CALL UPON HIM WHILE HE IS NEAR; LET THE WICKED FORSAKE HIS WAY AND THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAN HIS THOUGHTS; LET HIM RETURN TO THE LORD THAT HE MAY HAVE COMPASSION ON HIM AND TO OUR GOD FOR HE WILL ABUNDANTLY PARDON

FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS NEITHER ARE YOUR WAYS MY WAYS DECLARES THE LORD

FOR AS THE HEAVENS ARE HIGHER THAN THE EARTH SO ARE MY WAYS HIGHER THAN YOUR WAYS AND MY THOUGHTS THAN YOUR THOUGHTS

FOR AS THE RAIN AND THE SNOW COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND DO NOT RETURN THERE BUT WATER THE EARTH MAKING IT BRING FORTH AND SPROUT GIVING SEED TO THE SOWER AND BREAD TO THE EATER SO SHALL MY WORD BE THAT GOES OUT FROM MY MOUTH; IT SHALL NOT RETURN TO ME EMPTY BUT IT SHALL ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH I PURPOSE AND SHALL SUCCEED IN THE THING FOR WHICH I SENT IT

FOR YOU SHALL GO OUT IN JOY AND BE LED FORTH IN PEACE; THE MOUNTAINS AND THE HILLS BEFORE YOU SHALL BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING AND ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL CLAP THEIR HANDS

INSTEAD OF THE THORN SHALL COME UP THE CYPRESS; INSTEAD OF THE BRIER SHALL COME UP THE MYRTLE; AND IT SHALL MAKE A NAME FOR THE LORD AN EVERLASTING SIGN THAT SHALL NOT BE CUT OFF

THUS SAYS THE LORD KEEP JUSTICE AND DO RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR SOON MY SALVATION WILL COME AND MY DELIVERANCE BE REVEALED

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO DOES THIS AND THE SON OF MAN WHO HOLDS IT FAST WHO KEEPS THE SABBATH NOT PROFANING IT AND KEEPS HIS HAND FROM DOING ANY EVIL

 LET NOT THE FOREIGNER WHO HAS JOINED HIMSELF TO THE LORD SAY THE LORD WILL SURELY SEPARATE ME FROM HIS PEOPLE; AND LET NOT THE EUNUCH SAY BEHOLD I AM A DRY TREE

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD TO THE EUNUCHS WHO KEEP MY SABBATHS WHO CHOOSE THE THINGS THAT PLEASE ME AND HOLD FAST MY COVENANT I WILL GIVE IN MY HOUSE AND WITHIN MY WALLS A MONUMENT AND A NAME BETTER THAN SONS AND DAUGHTERS; I WILL GIVE THEM AN EVERLASTING NAME THAT SHALL NOT BE CUT OFF

AND THE FOREIGNERS WHO JOIN THEMSELVES TO THE LORD TO MINISTER TO HIM TO LOVE THE NAME OF THE LORD AND TO BE HIS SERVANTS EVERYONE WHO KEEPS THE SABBATH AND DOES NOT PROFANE IT AND HOLDS FAST MY COVENANT THESE I WILL BRING TO MY HOLY MOUNTAIN AND MAKE THEM JOYFUL IN MY HOUSE OF PRAYER; THEIR BURNT OFFERINGS AND THEIR SACRIFICES WILL BE ACCEPTED ON MY ALTAR; FOR MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL PEOPLES

 THE LORD GOD WHO GATHERS THE OUTCASTS OF ISRAEL DECLARES I WILL GATHER YET OTHERS TO HIM BESIDES THOSE ALREADY GATHERED

 ALL YOU BEASTS OF THE FIELD COME TO DEVOURALL YOU BEASTS IN THE FOREST

HIS WATCHMEN ARE BLIND; THEY ARE ALL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE; THEY ARE ALL SILENT DOGS; THEY CANNOT BARK DREAMING LYING DOWN LOVING TO SLUMBER

THE DOGS HAVE A MIGHTY APPETITE; THEY NEVER HAVE ENOUGH

BUT THEY ARE SHEPHERDS WHO HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING; THEY HAVE ALL TURNED TO THEIR OWN WAY EACH TO HIS OWN GAIN ONE AND ALL

COME THEY SAY LET ME GET WINE; LET US FILL OURSELVES WITH STRONG DRINK; AND TOMORROW WILL BE LIKE THIS DAY GREAT BEYOND MEASURE

THE RIGHTEOUS MAN PERISHES AND NO ONE LAYS IT TO HEART; DEVOUT MEN ARE TAKEN AWAY WHILE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS

FOR THE RIGHTEOUS MAN IS TAKEN AWAY FROM CALAMITY; HE ENTERS INTO PEACE; THEY REST IN THEIR BEDS WHO WALK IN THEIR UPRIGHTNESS

BUT YOU DRAW NEAR SONS OF THE SORCERESS OFFSPRING OF THE ADULTERER AND THE LOOSE WOMAN

WHOM ARE YOU MOCKING

AGAINST WHOM DO YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE AND STICK OUT YOUR TONGUE

ARE YOU NOT CHILDREN OF TRANSGRESSION THE OFFSPRING OF DECEIT YOU WHO BURN WITH LUST AMONG THE OAKS UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE WHO SLAUGHTER YOUR CHILDREN IN THE VALLEYS UNDER THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCKS

AMONG THE SMOOTH STONES OF THE VALLEY IS YOUR PORTION; THEY THEY ARE YOUR LOT; TO THEM YOU HAVE POURED OUT A DRINK OFFERING YOU HAVE BROUGHT A GRAIN OFFERING

SHALL I RELENT FOR THESE THINGS

ON A HIGH AND LOFTY MOUNTAIN YOU HAVE SET YOUR BED AND THERE YOU WENT UP TO OFFER SACRIFICE

BEHIND THE DOOR AND THE DOORPOST YOU HAVE SET UP YOUR MEMORIAL; FOR DESERTING ME YOU HAVE UNCOVERED YOUR BED YOU HAVE GONE UP TO IT YOU HAVE MADE IT WIDE; AND YOU HAVE MADE A COVENANT FOR YOURSELF WITH THEM YOU HAVE LOVED THEIR BED YOU HAVE LOOKED ON NAKEDNESS

YOU JOURNEYED TO THE KING WITH OIL AND MULTIPLIED YOUR PERFUMES; YOU SENT YOUR ENVOYS FAR OFF AND SENT DOWN EVEN TO SHEOL

YOU WERE WEARIED WITH THE LENGTH OF YOUR WAY BUT YOU DID NOT SAY IT IS HOPELESS; YOU FOUND NEW LIFE FOR YOUR STRENGTH AND SO YOU WERE NOT FAINT

WHOM DID YOU DREAD AND FEAR SO THAT YOU LIED AND DID NOT REMEMBER ME DID NOT LAY IT TO HEART

HAVE I NOT HELD MY PEACE EVEN FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU DO NOT FEAR ME

I WILL DECLARE YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND YOUR DEEDS BUT THEY WILL NOT PROFIT YOU

WHEN YOU CRY OUT LET YOUR COLLECTION OF IDOLS DELIVER YOU

THE WIND WILL CARRY THEM OFF A BREATH WILL TAKE THEM AWAY

BUT HE WHO TAKES REFUGE IN ME SHALL POSSESS THE LAND AND SHALL INHERIT MY HOLY MOUNTAIN

AND IT SHALL BE SAID BUILD UP BUILD UP PREPARE THE WAY REMOVE EVERY OBSTRUCTION FROM MY PEOPLE'S WAY

 FOR THUS SAYS THE ONE WHO IS HIGH AND LIFTED UP WHO INHABITS ETERNITY WHOSE NAME IS HOLY I DWELL IN THE HIGH AND HOLY PLACE AND ALSO WITH HIM WHO IS OF A CONTRITE AND LOWLY SPIRIT TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF THE LOWLY AND TO REVIVE THE HEART OF THE CONTRITE

FOR I WILL NOT CONTEND FOREVER NOR WILL I ALWAYS BE ANGRY; FOR THE SPIRIT WOULD GROW FAINT BEFORE ME AND THE BREATH OF LIFE THAT I MADE

BECAUSE OF THE INIQUITY OF HIS UNJUST GAIN I WAS ANGRY I STRUCK HIM; I HID MY FACE AND WAS ANGRY BUT HE WENT ON BACKSLIDING IN THE WAY OF HIS OWN HEART

I HAVE SEEN HIS WAYS BUT I WILL HEAL HIM; I WILL LEAD HIM AND RESTORE COMFORT TO HIM AND HIS MOURNERS CREATING THE FRUIT OF THE LIPS

PEACE PEACE TO THE FAR AND TO THE NEAR SAYS THE LORD AND I WILL HEAL HIM

BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TOSSING SEA; FOR IT CANNOT BE QUIET AND ITS WATERS TOSS UP MIRE AND DIRT

THERE IS NO PEACE SAYS MY GOD FOR THE WICKED

CRY ALOUD; DO NOT HOLD BACK; LIFT UP YOUR VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET; DECLARE TO MY PEOPLE THEIR TRANSGRESSION TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB THEIR SINS

YET THEY SEEK ME DAILY AND DELIGHT TO KNOW MY WAYS AS IF THEY WERE A NATION THAT DID RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DID NOT FORSAKE THE JUDGMENT OF THEIR GOD; THEY ASK OF ME RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENTS; THEY DELIGHT TO DRAW NEAR TO GOD

'WHY HAVE WE FASTED AND YOU SEE IT NOT

WHY HAVE WE HUMBLED OURSELVES AND YOU TAKE NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT

' BEHOLD IN THE DAY OF YOUR FAST YOU SEEK YOUR OWN PLEASURE AND OPPRESS ALL YOUR WORKERS

BEHOLD YOU FAST ONLY TO QUARREL AND TO FIGHT AND TO HIT WITH A WICKED FIST

FASTING LIKE YOURS THIS DAY WILL NOT MAKE YOUR VOICE TO BE HEARD ON HIGH

IS SUCH THE FAST THAT I CHOOSE A DAY FOR A PERSON TO HUMBLE HIMSELF

IS IT TO BOW DOWN HIS HEAD LIKE A REED AND TO SPREAD SACKCLOTH AND ASHES UNDER HIM

WILL YOU CALL THIS A FAST AND A DAY ACCEPTABLE TO THE LORD

IS NOT THIS THE FAST THAT I CHOOSE TO LOOSE THE BONDS OF WICKEDNESS TO UNDO THE STRAPS OF THE YOKE TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE AND TO BREAK EVERY YOKE

IS IT NOT TO SHARE YOUR BREAD WITH THE HUNGRY AND BRING THE HOMELESS POOR INTO YOUR HOUSE; WHEN YOU SEE THE NAKED TO COVER HIM AND NOT TO HIDE YOURSELF FROM YOUR OWN FLESH

THEN SHALL YOUR LIGHT BREAK FORTH LIKE THE DAWN AND YOUR HEALING SHALL SPRING UP SPEEDILY; YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL GO BEFORE YOU; THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR REAR GUARD

THEN YOU SHALL CALL AND THE LORD WILL ANSWER; YOU SHALL CRY AND HE WILL SAY 'HERE I AM

' IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE YOKE FROM YOUR MIDST THE POINTING OF THE FINGER AND SPEAKING WICKEDNESS IF YOU POUR YOURSELF OUT FOR THE HUNGRY AND SATISFY THE DESIRE OF THE AFFLICTED THEN SHALL YOUR LIGHT RISE IN THE DARKNESS AND YOUR GLOOM BE AS THE NOONDAY

AND THE LORD WILL GUIDE YOU CONTINUALLY AND SATISFY YOUR DESIRE IN SCORCHED PLACES AND MAKE YOUR BONES STRONG; AND YOU SHALL BE LIKE A WATERED GARDEN LIKE A SPRING OF WATER WHOSE WATERS DO NOT FAIL

AND YOUR ANCIENT RUINS SHALL BE REBUILT; YOU SHALL RAISE UP THE FOUNDATIONS OF MANY GENERATIONS; YOU SHALL BE CALLED THE REPAIRER OF THE BREACH THE RESTORER OF STREETS TO DWELL IN

IF YOU TURN BACK YOUR FOOT FROM THE SABBATH FROM DOING YOUR PLEASURE ON MY HOLY DAY AND CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT AND THE HOLY DAY OF THE LORD HONORABLE; IF YOU HONOR IT NOT GOING YOUR OWN WAYS OR SEEKING YOUR OWN PLEASURE OR TALKING IDLY; THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN THE LORD AND I WILL MAKE YOU RIDE ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE EARTH; I WILL FEED YOU WITH THE HERITAGE OF JACOB YOUR FATHER FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

BEHOLD THE LORD'S HAND IS NOT SHORTENED THAT IT CANNOT SAVE OR HIS EAR DULL THAT IT CANNOT HEAR; BUT YOUR INIQUITIES HAVE MADE A SEPARATION BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GOD AND YOUR SINS HAVE HIDDEN HIS FACE FROM YOU SO THAT HE DOES NOT HEAR

FOR YOUR HANDS ARE DEFILED WITH BLOOD AND YOUR FINGERS WITH INIQUITY; YOUR LIPS HAVE SPOKEN LIES; YOUR TONGUE MUTTERS WICKEDNESS

NO ONE ENTERS SUIT JUSTLY; NO ONE GOES TO LAW HONESTLY; THEY RELY ON EMPTY PLEAS THEY SPEAK LIES THEY CONCEIVE MISCHIEF AND GIVE BIRTH TO INIQUITY

THEY HATCH ADDERS' EGGS; THEY WEAVE THE SPIDER'S WEB; HE WHO EATS THEIR EGGS DIES AND FROM ONE THAT IS CRUSHED A VIPER IS HATCHED

THEIR WEBS WILL NOT SERVE AS CLOTHING; MEN WILL NOT COVER THEMSELVES WITH WHAT THEY MAKE

THEIR WORKS ARE WORKS OF INIQUITY AND DEEDS OF VIOLENCE ARE IN THEIR HANDS

THEIR FEET RUN TO EVIL AND THEY ARE SWIFT TO SHED INNOCENT BLOOD; THEIR THOUGHTS ARE THOUGHTS OF INIQUITY; DESOLATION AND DESTRUCTION ARE IN THEIR HIGHWAYS

THE WAY OF PEACE THEY DO NOT KNOW AND THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN THEIR PATHS; THEY HAVE MADE THEIR ROADS CROOKED; NO ONE WHO TREADS ON THEM KNOWS PEACE

THEREFORE JUSTICE IS FAR FROM US AND RIGHTEOUSNESS DOES NOT OVERTAKE US; WE HOPE FOR LIGHT AND BEHOLD DARKNESS AND FOR BRIGHTNESS BUT WE WALK IN GLOOM

WE GROPE FOR THE WALL LIKE THE BLIND; WE GROPE LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE NO EYES; WE STUMBLE AT NOON AS IN THE TWILIGHT AMONG THOSE IN FULL VIGOR WE ARE LIKE DEAD MEN

WE ALL GROWL LIKE BEARS; WE MOAN AND MOAN LIKE DOVES; WE HOPE FOR JUSTICE BUT THERE IS NONE; FOR SALVATION BUT IT IS FAR FROM US

FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS ARE MULTIPLIED BEFORE YOU AND OUR SINS TESTIFY AGAINST US; FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS ARE WITH US AND WE KNOW OUR INIQUITIES TRANSGRESSING AND DENYING THE LORD AND TURNING BACK FROM FOLLOWING OUR GOD SPEAKING OPPRESSION AND REVOLT CONCEIVING AND UTTERING FROM THE HEART LYING WORDS

JUSTICE IS TURNED BACKAND RIGHTEOUSNESS STANDS AFAR OFF; FOR TRUTH HAS STUMBLED IN THE PUBLIC SQUARESAND UPRIGHTNESS CANNOT ENTER

TRUTH IS LACKING AND HE WHO DEPARTS FROM EVIL MAKES HIMSELF A PREY

THE LORD SAW IT AND IT DISPLEASED HIM THAT THERE WAS NO JUSTICE

HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO MAN AND WONDERED THAT THERE WAS NO ONE TO INTERCEDE; THEN HIS OWN ARM BROUGHT HIM SALVATION AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS UPHELD HIM

HE PUT ON RIGHTEOUSNESS AS A BREASTPLATE AND A HELMET OF SALVATION ON HIS HEAD; HE PUT ON GARMENTS OF VENGEANCE FOR CLOTHING AND WRAPPED HIMSELF IN ZEAL AS A CLOAK

ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS SO WILL HE REPAY WRATH TO HIS ADVERSARIES REPAYMENT TO HIS ENEMIES; TO THE COASTLANDS HE WILL RENDER REPAYMENT

SO THEY SHALL FEAR THE NAME OF THE LORD FROM THE WEST AND HIS GLORY FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN; FOR HE WILL COME LIKE A RUSHING STREAM WHICH THE WIND OF THE LORD DRIVES

AND A REDEEMER WILL COME TO ZION TO THOSE IN JACOB WHO TURN FROM TRANSGRESSION DECLARES THE LORD

AND AS FOR ME THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM SAYS THE LORD MY SPIRIT THAT IS UPON YOU AND MY WORDS THAT I HAVE PUT IN YOUR MOUTH SHALL NOT DEPART OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR OUT OF THE MOUTH OF YOUR OFFSPRING OR OUT OF THE MOUTH OF YOUR CHILDREN'S OFFSPRING SAYS THE LORD FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

ARISE SHINE FOR YOUR LIGHT HAS COME AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS RISEN UPON YOU

FOR BEHOLD DARKNESS SHALL COVER THE EARTH AND THICK DARKNESS THE PEOPLES; BUT THE LORD WILL ARISE UPON YOU AND HIS GLORY WILL BE SEEN UPON YOU

AND NATIONS SHALL COME TO YOUR LIGHT AND KINGS TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR RISING

LIFT UP YOUR EYES ALL AROUND AND SEE; THEY ALL GATHER TOGETHER THEY COME TO YOU; YOUR SONS SHALL COME FROM AFAR AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL BE CARRIED ON THE HIP

THEN YOU SHALL SEE AND BE RADIANT; YOUR HEART SHALL THRILL AND EXULT BECAUSE THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SEA SHALL BE TURNED TO YOU THE WEALTH OF THE NATIONS SHALL COME TO YOU

A MULTITUDE OF CAMELS SHALL COVER YOU THE YOUNG CAMELS OF MIDIAN AND EPHAH; ALL THOSE FROM SHEBA SHALL COME

THEY SHALL BRING GOLD AND FRANKINCENSE AND SHALL BRING GOOD NEWS THE PRAISES OF THE LORD

ALL THE FLOCKS OF KEDAR SHALL BE GATHERED TO YOU; THE RAMS OF NEBAIOTH SHALL MINISTER TO YOU; THEY SHALL COME UP WITH ACCEPTANCE ON MY ALTAR AND I WILL BEAUTIFY MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE

WHO ARE THESE THAT FLY LIKE A CLOUD AND LIKE DOVES TO THEIR WINDOWS

FOR THE COASTLANDS SHALL HOPE FOR ME THE SHIPS OF TARSHISH FIRST TO BRING YOUR CHILDREN FROM AFAR THEIR SILVER AND GOLD WITH THEM FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND FOR THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE HE HAS MADE YOU BEAUTIFUL

FOREIGNERS SHALL BUILD UP YOUR WALLS AND THEIR KINGS SHALL MINISTER TO YOU; FOR IN MY WRATH I STRUCK YOU BUT IN MY FAVOR I HAVE HAD MERCY ON YOU

YOUR GATES SHALL BE OPEN CONTINUALLY; DAY AND NIGHT THEY SHALL NOT BE SHUT THAT PEOPLE MAY BRING TO YOU THE WEALTH OF THE NATIONS WITH THEIR KINGS LED IN PROCESSION

FOR THE NATION AND KINGDOM THAT WILL NOT SERVE YOU SHALL PERISH; THOSE NATIONS SHALL BE UTTERLY LAID WASTE

THE GLORY OF LEBANON SHALL COME TO YOU THE CYPRESS THE PLANE AND THE PINE TO BEAUTIFY THE PLACE OF MY SANCTUARY AND I WILL MAKE THE PLACE OF MY FEET GLORIOUS

THE SONS OF THOSE WHO AFFLICTED YOU SHALL COME BENDING LOW TO YOU AND ALL WHO DESPISED YOU SHALL BOW DOWN AT YOUR FEET; THEY SHALL CALL YOU THE CITY OF THE LORD THE ZION OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

WHEREAS YOU HAVE BEEN FORSAKEN AND HATED WITH NO ONE PASSING THROUGH I WILL MAKE YOU MAJESTIC FOREVER A JOY FROM AGE TO AGE

YOU SHALL SUCK THE MILK OF NATIONS; YOU SHALL NURSE AT THE BREAST OF KINGS; AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I THE LORD AM YOUR SAVIOR AND YOUR REDEEMER THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB

INSTEAD OF BRONZE I WILL BRING GOLD AND INSTEAD OF IRON I WILL BRING SILVER; INSTEAD OF WOOD BRONZE INSTEAD OF STONES IRON

I WILL MAKE YOUR OVERSEERS PEACE AND YOUR TASKMASTERS RIGHTEOUSNESS

VIOLENCE SHALL NO MORE BE HEARD IN YOUR LAND DEVASTATION OR DESTRUCTION WITHIN YOUR BORDERS; YOU SHALL CALL YOUR WALLS SALVATION AND YOUR GATES PRAISE

THE SUN SHALL BE NO MORE YOUR LIGHT BY DAY NOR FOR BRIGHTNESS SHALL THE MOON GIVE YOU LIGHT; BUT THE LORD WILL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT AND YOUR GOD WILL BE YOUR GLORY

YOUR SUN SHALL NO MORE GO DOWN NOR YOUR MOON WITHDRAW ITSELF; FOR THE LORD WILL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT AND YOUR DAYS OF MOURNING SHALL BE ENDED

YOUR PEOPLE SHALL ALL BE RIGHTEOUS; THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND FOREVER THE BRANCH OF MY PLANTING THE WORK OF MY HANDS THAT I MIGHT BE GLORIFIED

THE LEAST ONE SHALL BECOME A CLAN AND THE SMALLEST ONE A MIGHTY NATION; I AM THE LORD; IN ITS TIME I WILL HASTEN IT

THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GOD IS UPON ME BECAUSE THE LORD HAS ANOINTED ME TO BRING GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR; HE HAS SENT ME TO BIND UP THE BROKENHEARTED TO PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND; TO PROCLAIM THE YEAR OF THE LORD'S FAVOR AND THE DAY OF VENGEANCE OF OUR GOD; TO COMFORT ALL WHO MOURN; TO GRANT TO THOSE WHO MOURN IN ZIONTO GIVE THEM A BEAUTIFUL HEADDRESS INSTEAD OF ASHES THE OIL OF GLADNESS INSTEAD OF MOURNING THE GARMENT OF PRAISE INSTEAD OF A FAINT SPIRIT; THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED OAKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PLANTING OF THE LORD THAT HE MAY BE GLORIFIED

THEY SHALL BUILD UP THE ANCIENT RUINS; THEY SHALL RAISE UP THE FORMER DEVASTATIONS; THEY SHALL REPAIR THE RUINED CITIES THE DEVASTATIONS OF MANY GENERATIONS

STRANGERS SHALL STAND AND TEND YOUR FLOCKS; FOREIGNERS SHALL BE YOUR PLOWMEN AND VINEDRESSERS; BUT YOU SHALL BE CALLED THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD; THEY SHALL SPEAK OF YOU AS THE MINISTERS OF OUR GOD; YOU SHALL EAT THE WEALTH OF THE NATIONS AND IN THEIR GLORY YOU SHALL BOAST

INSTEAD OF YOUR SHAME THERE SHALL BE A DOUBLE PORTION; INSTEAD OF DISHONOR THEY SHALL REJOICE IN THEIR LOT; THEREFORE IN THEIR LAND THEY SHALL POSSESS A DOUBLE PORTION; THEY SHALL HAVE EVERLASTING JOY

FOR I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE; I HATE ROBBERY AND WRONG; I WILL FAITHFULLY GIVE THEM THEIR RECOMPENSE AND I WILL MAKE AN EVERLASTING COVENANT WITH THEM

THEIR OFFSPRING SHALL BE KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLES; ALL WHO SEE THEM SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE THEM THAT THEY ARE AN OFFSPRING THE LORD HAS BLESSED

I WILL GREATLY REJOICE IN THE LORD; MY SOUL SHALL EXULT IN MY GOD FOR HE HAS CLOTHED ME WITH THE GARMENTS OF SALVATION; HE HAS COVERED ME WITH THE ROBE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AS A BRIDEGROOM DECKS HIMSELF LIKE A PRIEST WITH A BEAUTIFUL HEADDRESS AND AS A BRIDE ADORNS HERSELF WITH HER JEWELS

FOR AS THE EARTH BRINGS FORTH ITS SPROUTS AND AS A GARDEN CAUSES WHAT IS SOWN IN IT TO SPROUT UP SO THE LORD GOD WILL CAUSE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PRAISE TO SPROUT UP BEFORE ALL THE NATIONS

FOR ZION'S SAKE I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT AND FOR JERUSALEM'S SAKE I WILL NOT BE QUIET UNTIL HER RIGHTEOUSNESS GOES FORTH AS BRIGHTNESS AND HER SALVATION AS A BURNING TORCH

THE NATIONS SHALL SEE YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THE KINGS YOUR GLORY AND YOU SHALL BE CALLED BY A NEW NAME THAT THE MOUTH OF THE LORD WILL GIVE

YOU SHALL BE A CROWN OF BEAUTY IN THE HAND OF THE LORD AND A ROYAL DIADEM IN THE HAND OF YOUR GOD

YOU SHALL NO MORE BE TERMED FORSAKEN AND YOUR LAND SHALL NO MORE BE TERMED DESOLATE BUT YOU SHALL BE CALLED MY DELIGHT IS IN HER AND YOUR LAND MARRIED; FOR THE LORD DELIGHTS IN YOU AND YOUR LAND SHALL BE MARRIED

FOR AS A YOUNG MAN MARRIES A YOUNG WOMAN SO SHALL YOUR SONS MARRY YOU AND AS THE BRIDEGROOM REJOICES OVER THE BRIDE SO SHALL YOUR GOD REJOICE OVER YOU

ON YOUR WALLS O JERUSALEM I HAVE SET WATCHMEN; ALL THE DAY AND ALL THE NIGHT THEY SHALL NEVER BE SILENT

YOU WHO PUT THE LORD IN REMEMBRANCE TAKE NO REST AND GIVE HIM NO REST UNTIL HE ESTABLISHES JERUSALEM AND MAKES IT A PRAISE IN THE EARTH

THE LORD HAS SWORN BY HIS RIGHT HAND AND BY HIS MIGHTY ARM I WILL NOT AGAIN GIVE YOUR GRAIN TO BE FOOD FOR YOUR ENEMIES AND FOREIGNERS SHALL NOT DRINK YOUR WINE FOR WHICH YOU HAVE LABORED; BUT THOSE WHO GARNER IT SHALL EAT IT AND PRAISE THE LORD AND THOSE WHO GATHER IT SHALL DRINK IT IN THE COURTS OF MY SANCTUARY

 GO THROUGH GO THROUGH THE GATES; PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE PEOPLE; BUILD UP BUILD UP THE HIGHWAY; CLEAR IT OF STONES; LIFT UP A SIGNAL OVER THE PEOPLES

BEHOLD THE LORD HAS PROCLAIMED TO THE END OF THE EARTH SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION BEHOLD YOUR SALVATION COMES; BEHOLD HIS REWARD IS WITH HIM AND HIS RECOMPENSE BEFORE HIM

 AND THEY SHALL BE CALLED THE HOLY PEOPLE THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD; AND YOU SHALL BE CALLED SOUGHT OUT A CITY NOT FORSAKEN

WHO IS THIS WHO COMES FROM EDOM IN CRIMSONED GARMENTS FROM BOZRAH HE WHO IS SPLENDID IN HIS APPAREL MARCHING IN THE GREATNESS OF HIS STRENGTH

IT IS I SPEAKING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS MIGHTY TO SAVE

 WHY IS YOUR APPAREL RED AND YOUR GARMENTS LIKE HIS WHO TREADS IN THE WINEPRESS

I HAVE TRODDEN THE WINEPRESS ALONE AND FROM THE PEOPLES NO ONE WAS WITH ME; I TROD THEM IN MY ANGER AND TRAMPLED THEM IN MY WRATH; THEIR LIFEBLOOD SPATTERED ON MY GARMENTS AND STAINED ALL MY APPAREL

FOR THE DAY OF VENGEANCE WAS IN MY HEART AND MY YEAR OF REDEMPTION HAD COME

I LOOKED BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP; I WAS APPALLED BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO UPHOLD; SO MY OWN ARM BROUGHT ME SALVATION AND MY WRATH UPHELD ME

I TRAMPLED DOWN THE PEOPLES IN MY ANGER; I MADE THEM DRUNK IN MY WRATH AND I POURED OUT THEIR LIFEBLOOD ON THE EARTH

 I WILL RECOUNT THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD THE PRAISES OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD HAS GRANTED US AND THE GREAT GOODNESS TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THAT HE HAS GRANTED THEM ACCORDING TO HIS COMPASSION ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS STEADFAST LOVE

FOR HE SAID SURELY THEY ARE MY PEOPLE CHILDREN WHO WILL NOT DEAL FALSELY

 AND HE BECAME THEIR SAVIOR

IN ALL THEIR AFFLICTION HE WAS AFFLICTED AND THE ANGEL OF HIS PRESENCE SAVED THEM; IN HIS LOVE AND IN HIS PITY HE REDEEMED THEM; HE LIFTED THEM UP AND CARRIED THEM ALL THE DAYS OF OLD

BUT THEY REBELLED AND GRIEVED HIS HOLY SPIRIT; THEREFORE HE TURNED TO BE THEIR ENEMY AND HIMSELF FOUGHT AGAINST THEM

THEN HE REMEMBERED THE DAYS OF OLD OF MOSES AND HIS PEOPLE

WHERE IS HE WHO BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF THE SEA WITH THE SHEPHERDS OF HIS FLOCK

WHERE IS HE WHO PUT IN THE MIDST OF THEM HIS HOLY SPIRIT WHO CAUSED HIS GLORIOUS ARM TO GO AT THE RIGHT HAND OF MOSES WHO DIVIDED THE WATERS BEFORE THEM TO MAKE FOR HIMSELF AN EVERLASTING NAME WHO LED THEM THROUGH THE DEPTHS

LIKE A HORSE IN THE DESERT THEY DID NOT STUMBLE

LIKE LIVESTOCK THAT GO DOWN INTO THE VALLEY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GAVE THEM REST

SO YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE TO MAKE FOR YOURSELF A GLORIOUS NAME

LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND SEE FROM YOUR HOLY AND BEAUTIFUL HABITATION

WHERE ARE YOUR ZEAL AND YOUR MIGHT

THE STIRRING OF YOUR INNER PARTS AND YOUR COMPASSION ARE HELD BACK FROM ME

FOR YOU ARE OUR FATHER THOUGH ABRAHAM DOES NOT KNOW US AND ISRAEL DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE US; YOU O LORD ARE OUR FATHER OUR REDEEMER FROM OF OLD IS YOUR NAME

O LORD WHY DO YOU MAKE US WANDER FROM YOUR WAYS AND HARDEN OUR HEART SO THAT WE FEAR YOU NOT

RETURN FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SERVANTS THE TRIBES OF YOUR HERITAGE

YOUR HOLY PEOPLE HELD POSSESSION FOR A LITTLE WHILE; OUR ADVERSARIES HAVE TRAMPLED DOWN YOUR SANCTUARY

WE HAVE BECOME LIKE THOSE OVER WHOM YOU HAVE NEVER RULED LIKE THOSE WHO ARE NOT CALLED BY YOUR NAME

OH THAT YOU WOULD REND THE HEAVENS AND COME DOWN THAT THE MOUNTAINS MIGHT QUAKE AT YOUR PRESENCE AS WHEN FIRE KINDLES BRUSHWOOD AND THE FIRE CAUSES WATER TO BOILTO MAKE YOUR NAME KNOWN TO YOUR ADVERSARIES AND THAT THE NATIONS MIGHT TREMBLE AT YOUR PRESENCE

WHEN YOU DID AWESOME THINGS THAT WE DID NOT LOOK FOR YOU CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAINS QUAKED AT YOUR PRESENCE

FROM OF OLD NO ONE HAS HEARD OR PERCEIVED BY THE EAR NO EYE HAS SEEN A GOD BESIDES YOU WHO ACTS FOR THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIM

YOU MEET HIM WHO JOYFULLY WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS THOSE WHO REMEMBER YOU IN YOUR WAYS

BEHOLD YOU WERE ANGRY AND WE SINNED; IN OUR SINS WE HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AND SHALL WE BE SAVED

WE HAVE ALL BECOME LIKE ONE WHO IS UNCLEAN AND ALL OUR RIGHTEOUS DEEDS ARE LIKE A POLLUTED GARMENT

WE ALL FADE LIKE A LEAF AND OUR INIQUITIES LIKE THE WIND TAKE US AWAY

THERE IS NO ONE WHO CALLS UPON YOUR NAME WHO ROUSES HIMSELF TO TAKE HOLD OF YOU; FOR YOU HAVE HIDDEN YOUR FACE FROM US AND HAVE MADE US MELT IN THE HAND OF OUR INIQUITIES

BUT NOW O LORD YOU ARE OUR FATHER; WE ARE THE CLAY AND YOU ARE OUR POTTER; WE ARE ALL THE WORK OF YOUR HAND

BE NOT SO TERRIBLY ANGRY O LORD AND REMEMBER NOT INIQUITY FOREVER

BEHOLD PLEASE LOOK WE ARE ALL YOUR PEOPLE

YOUR HOLY CITIES HAVE BECOME A WILDERNESS; ZION HAS BECOME A WILDERNESS JERUSALEM A DESOLATION

OUR HOLY AND BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WHERE OUR FATHERS PRAISED YOU HAS BEEN BURNED BY FIRE AND ALL OUR PLEASANT PLACES HAVE BECOME RUINS

WILL YOU RESTRAIN YOURSELF AT THESE THINGS O LORD

WILL YOU KEEP SILENT AND AFFLICT US SO TERRIBLY

I WAS READY TO BE SOUGHT BY THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME; I WAS READY TO BE FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME

I SAID HERE AM I HERE AM I TO A NATION THAT WAS NOT CALLED BY MY NAME

I SPREAD OUT MY HANDS ALL THE DAY TO A REBELLIOUS PEOPLE WHO WALK IN A WAY THAT IS NOT GOOD FOLLOWING THEIR OWN DEVICES; A PEOPLE WHO PROVOKE ME TO MY FACE CONTINUALLY SACRIFICING IN GARDENS AND MAKING OFFERINGS ON BRICKS; WHO SIT IN TOMBS AND SPEND THE NIGHT IN SECRET PLACES; WHO EAT PIG'S FLESH AND BROTH OF TAINTED MEAT IS IN THEIR VESSELS; WHO SAY KEEP TO YOURSELF DO NOT COME NEAR ME FOR I AM TOO HOLY FOR YOU

 THESE ARE A SMOKE IN MY NOSTRILS A FIRE THAT BURNS ALL THE DAY

BEHOLD IT IS WRITTEN BEFORE ME I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT BUT I WILL REPAY; I WILL INDEED REPAY INTO THEIR BOSOM BOTH YOUR INIQUITIES AND YOUR FATHERS' INIQUITIES TOGETHER SAYS THE LORD; BECAUSE THEY MADE OFFERINGS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND INSULTED ME ON THE HILLS I WILL MEASURE INTO THEIR BOSOM PAYMENT FOR THEIR FORMER DEEDS

 THUS SAYS THE LORD AS THE NEW WINE IS FOUND IN THE CLUSTER AND THEY SAY 'DO NOT DESTROY IT FOR THERE IS A BLESSING IN IT' SO I WILL DO FOR MY SERVANTS' SAKE AND NOT DESTROY THEM ALL

I WILL BRING FORTH OFFSPRING FROM JACOB AND FROM JUDAH POSSESSORS OF MY MOUNTAINS; MY CHOSEN SHALL POSSESS IT AND MY SERVANTS SHALL DWELL THERE

SHARON SHALL BECOME A PASTURE FOR FLOCKS AND THE VALLEY OF ACHOR A PLACE FOR HERDS TO LIE DOWN FOR MY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ME

BUT YOU WHO FORSAKE THE LORD WHO FORGET MY HOLY MOUNTAIN WHO SET A TABLE FOR FORTUNE AND FILL CUPS OF MIXED WINE FOR DESTINY I WILL DESTINE YOU TO THE SWORD AND ALL OF YOU SHALL BOW DOWN TO THE SLAUGHTER BECAUSE WHEN I CALLED YOU DID NOT ANSWER; WHEN I SPOKE YOU DID NOT LISTEN BUT YOU DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN MY EYES AND CHOSE WHAT I DID NOT DELIGHT IN

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD MY SERVANTS SHALL EAT BUT YOU SHALL BE HUNGRY; BEHOLD MY SERVANTS SHALL DRINK BUT YOU SHALL BE THIRSTY; BEHOLD MY SERVANTS SHALL REJOICE BUT YOU SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME; BEHOLD MY SERVANTS SHALL SING FOR GLADNESS OF HEART BUT YOU SHALL CRY OUT FOR PAIN OF HEART AND SHALL WAIL FOR BREAKING OF SPIRIT

YOU SHALL LEAVE YOUR NAME TO MY CHOSEN FOR A CURSE AND THE LORD GOD WILL PUT YOU TO DEATH BUT HIS SERVANTS HE WILL CALL BY ANOTHER NAME

SO THAT HE WHO BLESSES HIMSELF IN THE LAND SHALL BLESS HIMSELF BY THE GOD OF TRUTH AND HE WHO TAKES AN OATH IN THE LAND SHALL SWEAR BY THE GOD OF TRUTH; BECAUSE THE FORMER TROUBLES ARE FORGOTTEN AND ARE HIDDEN FROM MY EYES

FOR BEHOLD I CREATE NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH AND THE FORMER THINGS SHALL NOT BE REMEMBERED OR COME INTO MIND

BUT BE GLAD AND REJOICE FOREVER IN THAT WHICH I CREATE; FOR BEHOLD I CREATE JERUSALEM TO BE A JOY AND HER PEOPLE TO BE A GLADNESS

I WILL REJOICE IN JERUSALEM AND BE GLAD IN MY PEOPLE; NO MORE SHALL BE HEARD IN IT THE SOUND OF WEEPING AND THE CRY OF DISTRESS

NO MORE SHALL THERE BE IN IT AN INFANT WHO LIVES BUT A FEW DAYS OR AN OLD MAN WHO DOES NOT FILL OUT HIS DAYS FOR THE YOUNG MAN SHALL DIE A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND THE SINNER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SHALL BE ACCURSED

THEY SHALL BUILD HOUSES AND INHABIT THEM; THEY SHALL PLANT VINEYARDS AND EAT THEIR FRUIT

THEY SHALL NOT BUILD AND ANOTHER INHABIT; THEY SHALL NOT PLANT AND ANOTHER EAT; FOR LIKE THE DAYS OF A TREE SHALL THE DAYS OF MY PEOPLE BE AND MY CHOSEN SHALL LONG ENJOY THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS

THEY SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN OR BEAR CHILDREN FOR CALAMITY FOR THEY SHALL BE THE OFFSPRING OF THE BLESSED OF THE LORD AND THEIR DESCENDANTS WITH THEM

BEFORE THEY CALL I WILL ANSWER; WHILE THEY ARE YET SPEAKING I WILL HEAR

THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL GRAZE TOGETHER; THE LION SHALL EAT STRAW LIKE THE OX AND DUST SHALL BE THE SERPENT'S FOOD

THEY SHALL NOT HURT OR DESTROY IN ALL MY HOLY MOUNTAIN SAYS THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD HEAVEN IS MY THRONE AND THE EARTH IS MY FOOTSTOOL; WHAT IS THE HOUSE THAT YOU WOULD BUILD FOR ME AND WHAT IS THE PLACE OF MY REST

ALL THESE THINGS MY HAND HAS MADE AND SO ALL THESE THINGS CAME TO BE DECLARES THE LORD

BUT THIS IS THE ONE TO WHOM I WILL LOOK HE WHO IS HUMBLE AND CONTRITE IN SPIRIT AND TREMBLES AT MY WORD

HE WHO SLAUGHTERS AN OX IS LIKE ONE WHO KILLS A MAN; HE WHO SACRIFICES A LAMB LIKE ONE WHO BREAKS A DOG'S NECK; HE WHO PRESENTS A GRAIN OFFERING LIKE ONE WHO OFFERS PIG'S BLOOD; HE WHO MAKES A MEMORIAL OFFERING OF FRANKINCENSE LIKE ONE WHO BLESSES AN IDOL

THESE HAVE CHOSEN THEIR OWN WAYS AND THEIR SOUL DELIGHTS IN THEIR ABOMINATIONS; I ALSO WILL CHOOSE HARSH TREATMENT FOR THEM AND BRING THEIR FEARS UPON THEM BECAUSE WHEN I CALLED NO ONE ANSWERED WHEN I SPOKE THEY DID NOT LISTEN; BUT THEY DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN MY EYES AND CHOSE THAT IN WHICH I DID NOT DELIGHT

 HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD YOU WHO TREMBLE AT HIS WORD YOUR BROTHERS WHO HATE YOU AND CAST YOU OUT FOR MY NAME'S SAKE HAVE SAID 'LET THE LORD BE GLORIFIED THAT WE MAY SEE YOUR JOY'; BUT IT IS THEY WHO SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME

THE SOUND OF AN UPROAR FROM THE CITY

A SOUND FROM THE TEMPLE

THE SOUND OF THE LORD RENDERING RECOMPENSE TO HIS ENEMIES

BEFORE SHE WAS IN LABOR SHE GAVE BIRTH; BEFORE HER PAIN CAME UPON HER SHE DELIVERED A SON

WHO HAS HEARD SUCH A THING

WHO HAS SEEN SUCH THINGS

SHALL A LAND BE BORN IN ONE DAY

SHALL A NATION BE BROUGHT FORTH IN ONE MOMENT

FOR AS SOON AS ZION WAS IN LABOR SHE BROUGHT FORTH HER CHILDREN

SHALL I BRING TO THE POINT OF BIRTH AND NOT CAUSE TO BRING FORTH

 SAYS THE LORD; SHALL I WHO CAUSE TO BRING FORTH SHUT THE WOMB

 SAYS YOUR GOD

REJOICE WITH JERUSALEM AND BE GLAD FOR HER ALL YOU WHO LOVE HER; REJOICE WITH HER IN JOY ALL YOU WHO MOURN OVER HER; THAT YOU MAY NURSE AND BE SATISFIED FROM HER CONSOLING BREAST; THAT YOU MAY DRINK DEEPLY WITH DELIGHT FROM HER GLORIOUS ABUNDANCE

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL EXTEND PEACE TO HER LIKE A RIVER AND THE GLORY OF THE NATIONS LIKE AN OVERFLOWING STREAM; AND YOU SHALL NURSE YOU SHALL BE CARRIED UPON HER HIP AND BOUNCED UPON HER KNEES

AS ONE WHOM HIS MOTHER COMFORTS SO I WILL COMFORT YOU; YOU SHALL BE COMFORTED IN JERUSALEM

YOU SHALL SEE AND YOUR HEART SHALL REJOICE; YOUR BONES SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE GRASS; AND THE HAND OF THE LORD SHALL BE KNOWN TO HIS SERVANTS AND HE SHALL SHOW HIS INDIGNATION AGAINST HIS ENEMIES

FOR BEHOLD THE LORD WILL COME IN FIRE AND HIS CHARIOTS LIKE THE WHIRLWIND TO RENDER HIS ANGER IN FURY AND HIS REBUKE WITH FLAMES OF FIRE

FOR BY FIRE WILL THE LORD ENTER INTO JUDGMENT AND BY HIS SWORD WITH ALL FLESH; AND THOSE SLAIN BY THE LORD SHALL BE MANY

THOSE WHO SANCTIFY AND PURIFY THEMSELVES TO GO INTO THE GARDENS FOLLOWING ONE IN THE MIDST EATING PIG'S FLESH AND THE ABOMINATION AND MICE SHALL COME TO AN END TOGETHER DECLARES THE LORD

FOR I KNOW THEIR WORKS AND THEIR THOUGHTS AND THE TIME IS COMING TO GATHER ALL NATIONS AND TONGUES

AND THEY SHALL COME AND SHALL SEE MY GLORY AND I WILL SET A SIGN AMONG THEM

AND FROM THEM I WILL SEND SURVIVORS TO THE NATIONS TO TARSHISH PUL AND LUD WHO DRAW THE BOW TO TUBAL AND JAVAN TO THE COASTLANDS AFAR OFF THAT HAVE NOT HEARD MY FAME OR SEEN MY GLORY

AND THEY SHALL DECLARE MY GLORY AMONG THE NATIONS

AND THEY SHALL BRING ALL YOUR BROTHERS FROM ALL THE NATIONS AS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD ON HORSES AND IN CHARIOTS AND IN LITTERS AND ON MULES AND ON DROMEDARIES TO MY HOLY MOUNTAIN JERUSALEM SAYS THE LORD JUST AS THE ISRAELITES BRING THEIR GRAIN OFFERING IN A CLEAN VESSEL TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND SOME OF THEM ALSO I WILL TAKE FOR PRIESTS AND FOR LEVITES SAYS THE LORD

FOR AS THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH THAT I MAKE SHALL REMAIN BEFORE ME SAYS THE LORD SO SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING AND YOUR NAME REMAIN

FROM NEW MOON TO NEW MOON AND FROM SABBATH TO SABBATH ALL FLESH SHALL COME TO WORSHIP BEFORE ME DECLARES THE LORD

AND THEY SHALL GO OUT AND LOOK ON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE MEN WHO HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

FOR THEIR WORM SHALL NOT DIE THEIR FIRE SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED AND THEY SHALL BE AN ABHORRENCE TO ALL FLESH

 THESSALONIANSPAUL SILVANUS AND TIMOTHYTO THE CHURCH OF THE THESSALONIANS IN GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

WE OUGHT ALWAYS TO GIVE THANKS TO GOD FOR YOU BROTHERS AS IS RIGHT BECAUSE YOUR FAITH IS GROWING ABUNDANTLY AND THE LOVE OF EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR ONE ANOTHER IS INCREASING

THEREFORE WE OURSELVES BOAST ABOUT YOU IN THE CHURCHES OF GOD FOR YOUR STEADFASTNESS AND FAITH IN ALL YOUR PERSECUTIONS AND IN THE AFFLICTIONS THAT YOU ARE ENDURING

THIS IS EVIDENCE OF THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT OF GOD THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDERED WORTHY OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD FOR WHICH YOU ARE ALSO SUFFERING SINCE INDEED GOD CONSIDERS IT JUST TO REPAY WITH AFFLICTION THOSE WHO AFFLICT YOU AND TO GRANT RELIEF TO YOU WHO ARE AFFLICTED AS WELL AS TO US WHEN THE LORD JESUS IS REVEALED FROM HEAVEN WITH HIS MIGHTY ANGELS IN FLAMING FIRE INFLICTING VENGEANCE ON THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD AND ON THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY THE GOSPEL OF OUR LORD JESUS

THEY WILL SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT OF ETERNAL DESTRUCTION AWAY FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND FROM THE GLORY OF HIS MIGHT WHEN HE COMES ON THAT DAY TO BE GLORIFIED IN HIS SAINTS AND TO BE MARVELED AT AMONG ALL WHO HAVE BELIEVED BECAUSE OUR TESTIMONY TO YOU WAS BELIEVED

TO THIS END WE ALWAYS PRAY FOR YOU THAT OUR GOD MAY MAKE YOU WORTHY OF HIS CALLING AND MAY FULFILL EVERY RESOLVE FOR GOOD AND EVERY WORK OF FAITH BY HIS POWER SO THAT THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS MAY BE GLORIFIED IN YOU AND YOU IN HIM ACCORDING TO THE GRACE OF OUR GOD AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

NOW CONCERNING THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND OUR BEING GATHERED TOGETHER TO HIM WE ASK YOU BROTHERS NOT TO BE QUICKLY SHAKEN IN MIND OR ALARMED EITHER BY A SPIRIT OR A SPOKEN WORD OR A LETTER SEEMING TO BE FROM US TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DAY OF THE LORD HAS COME

LET NO ONE DECEIVE YOU IN ANY WAY

FOR THAT DAY WILL NOT COME UNLESS THE REBELLION COMES FIRST AND THE MAN OF LAWLESSNESS IS REVEALED THE SON OF DESTRUCTION WHO OPPOSES AND EXALTS HIMSELF AGAINST EVERY SOCALLED GOD OR OBJECT OF WORSHIP SO THAT HE TAKES HIS SEAT IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD PROCLAIMING HIMSELF TO BE GOD

DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS STILL WITH YOU I TOLD YOU THESE THINGS

AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS RESTRAINING HIM NOW SO THAT HE MAY BE REVEALED IN HIS TIME

FOR THE MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS IS ALREADY AT WORK

ONLY HE WHO NOW RESTRAINS IT WILL DO SO UNTIL HE IS OUT OF THE WAY

AND THEN THE LAWLESS ONE WILL BE REVEALED WHOM THE LORD JESUS WILL KILL WITH THE BREATH OF HIS MOUTH AND BRING TO NOTHING BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMING

THE COMING OF THE LAWLESS ONE IS BY THE ACTIVITY OF SATAN WITH ALL POWER AND FALSE SIGNS AND WONDERS AND WITH ALL WICKED DECEPTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE PERISHING BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO LOVE THE TRUTH AND SO BE SAVED

THEREFORE GOD SENDS THEM A STRONG DELUSION SO THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE WHAT IS FALSE IN ORDER THAT ALL MAY BE CONDEMNED WHO DID NOT BELIEVE THE TRUTH BUT HAD PLEASURE IN UNRIGHTEOUSNESS

BUT WE OUGHT ALWAYS TO GIVE THANKS TO GOD FOR YOU BROTHERS BELOVED BY THE LORD BECAUSE GOD CHOSE YOU AS THE FIRSTFRUITS TO BE SAVED THROUGH SANCTIFICATION BY THE SPIRIT AND BELIEF IN THE TRUTH

TO THIS HE CALLED YOU THROUGH OUR GOSPEL SO THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE GLORY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

SO THEN BROTHERS STAND FIRM AND HOLD TO THE TRADITIONS THAT YOU WERE TAUGHT BY US EITHER BY OUR SPOKEN WORD OR BY OUR LETTER

NOW MAY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF AND GOD OUR FATHER WHO LOVED US AND GAVE US ETERNAL COMFORT AND GOOD HOPE THROUGH GRACE COMFORT YOUR HEARTS AND ESTABLISH THEM IN EVERY GOOD WORK AND WORD

FINALLY BROTHERS PRAY FOR US THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD MAY SPEED AHEAD AND BE HONORED AS HAPPENED AMONG YOU AND THAT WE MAY BE DELIVERED FROM WICKED AND EVIL MEN

FOR NOT ALL HAVE FAITH

BUT THE LORD IS FAITHFUL

HE WILL ESTABLISH YOU AND GUARD YOU AGAINST THE EVIL ONE

AND WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE LORD ABOUT YOU THAT YOU ARE DOING AND WILL DO THE THINGS THAT WE COMMAND

MAY THE LORD DIRECT YOUR HEARTS TO THE LOVE OF GOD AND TO THE STEADFASTNESS OF CHRIST

NOW WE COMMAND YOU BROTHERS IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT YOU KEEP AWAY FROM ANY BROTHER WHO IS WALKING IN IDLENESS AND NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE TRADITION THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM US

FOR YOU YOURSELVES KNOW HOW YOU OUGHT TO IMITATE US BECAUSE WE WERE NOT IDLE WHEN WE WERE WITH YOU NOR DID WE EAT ANYONE'S BREAD WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT BUT WITH TOIL AND LABOR WE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE A BURDEN TO ANY OF YOU

IT WAS NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT BUT TO GIVE YOU IN OURSELVES AN EXAMPLE TO IMITATE

FOR EVEN WHEN WE WERE WITH YOU WE WOULD GIVE YOU THIS COMMAND IF ANYONE IS NOT WILLING TO WORK LET HIM NOT EAT

FOR WE HEAR THAT SOME AMONG YOU WALK IN IDLENESS NOT BUSY AT WORK BUT BUSYBODIES

NOW SUCH PERSONS WE COMMAND AND ENCOURAGE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO DO THEIR WORK QUIETLY AND TO EARN THEIR OWN LIVING

AS FOR YOU BROTHERS DO NOT GROW WEARY IN DOING GOOD

IF ANYONE DOES NOT OBEY WHAT WE SAY IN THIS LETTER TAKE NOTE OF THAT PERSON AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM THAT HE MAY BE ASHAMED

DO NOT REGARD HIM AS AN ENEMY BUT WARN HIM AS A BROTHER

NOW MAY THE LORD OF PEACE HIMSELF GIVE YOU PEACE AT ALL TIMES IN EVERY WAY

THE LORD BE WITH YOU ALL

I PAUL WRITE THIS GREETING WITH MY OWN HAND

THIS IS THE SIGN OF GENUINENESS IN EVERY LETTER OF MINE; IT IS THE WAY I WRITE

THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOU ALL

ALL THESE WHO WERE CHOSEN AS GATEKEEPERS AT THE THRESHOLDS WERE 

THEY WERE ENROLLED BY GENEALOGIES IN THEIR VILLAGES

DAVID AND SAMUEL THE SEER ESTABLISHED THEM IN THEIR OFFICE OF TRUST

SO THEY AND THEIR SONS WERE IN CHARGE OF THE GATES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THAT IS THE HOUSE OF THE TENT AS GUARDS

NOW THE PHILISTINES FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL FLED BEFORE THE PHILISTINES AND FELL SLAIN ON MOUNT GILBOA

AND THE PHILISTINES OVERTOOK SAUL AND HIS SONS AND THE PHILISTINES STRUCK DOWN JONATHAN AND ABINADAB AND MALCHISHUA THE SONS OF SAUL

THE BATTLE PRESSED HARD AGAINST SAUL AND THE ARCHERS FOUND HIM AND HE WAS WOUNDED BY THE ARCHERS

THEN SAUL SAID TO HIS ARMORBEARER DRAW YOUR SWORD AND THRUST ME THROUGH WITH IT LEST THESE UNCIRCUMCISED COME AND MISTREAT ME

 BUT HIS ARMORBEARER WOULD NOT FOR HE FEARED GREATLY

THEREFORE SAUL TOOK HIS OWN SWORD AND FELL UPON IT

AND WHEN HIS ARMORBEARER SAW THAT SAUL WAS DEAD HE ALSO FELL UPON HIS SWORD AND DIED

THUS SAUL DIED; HE AND HIS THREE SONS AND ALL HIS HOUSE DIED TOGETHER

AND WHEN ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL WHO WERE IN THE VALLEY SAW THAT THE ARMY HAD FLED AND THAT SAUL AND HIS SONS WERE DEAD THEY ABANDONED THEIR CITIES AND FLED AND THE PHILISTINES CAME AND LIVED IN THEM

THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE PHILISTINES CAME TO STRIP THE SLAIN THEY FOUND SAUL AND HIS SONS FALLEN ON MOUNT GILBOA

AND THEY STRIPPED HIM AND TOOK HIS HEAD AND HIS ARMOR AND SENT MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES TO CARRY THE GOOD NEWS TO THEIR IDOLS AND TO THE PEOPLE

AND THEY PUT HIS ARMOR IN THE TEMPLE OF THEIR GODS AND FASTENED HIS HEAD IN THE TEMPLE OF DAGON

BUT WHEN ALL JABESHGILEAD HEARD ALL THAT THE PHILISTINES HAD DONE TO SAUL ALL THE VALIANT MEN AROSE AND TOOK AWAY THE BODY OF SAUL AND THE BODIES OF HIS SONS AND BROUGHT THEM TO JABESH

AND THEY BURIED THEIR BONES UNDER THE OAK IN JABESH AND FASTED SEVEN DAYS

SO SAUL DIED FOR HIS BREACH OF FAITH

HE BROKE FAITH WITH THE LORD IN THAT HE DID NOT KEEP THE COMMAND OF THE LORD AND ALSO CONSULTED A MEDIUM SEEKING GUIDANCE

HE DID NOT SEEK GUIDANCE FROM THE LORD

THEREFORE THE LORD PUT HIM TO DEATH AND TURNED THE KINGDOM OVER TO DAVID THE SON OF JESSE

THEN ALL ISRAEL GATHERED TOGETHER TO DAVID AT HEBRON AND SAID BEHOLD WE ARE YOUR BONE AND FLESH

IN TIMES PAST EVEN WHEN SAUL WAS KING IT WAS YOU WHO LED OUT AND BROUGHT IN ISRAEL

AND THE LORD YOUR GOD SAID TO YOU 'YOU SHALL BE SHEPHERD OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND YOU SHALL BE PRINCE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' SO ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME TO THE KING AT HEBRON AND DAVID MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM AT HEBRON BEFORE THE LORD

AND THEY ANOINTED DAVID KING OVER ISRAEL ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD BY SAMUEL

AND DAVID AND ALL ISRAEL WENT TO JERUSALEM THAT IS JEBUS WHERE THE JEBUSITES WERE THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

THE INHABITANTS OF JEBUS SAID TO DAVID YOU WILL NOT COME IN HERE

 NEVERTHELESS DAVID TOOK THE STRONGHOLD OF ZION THAT IS THE CITY OF DAVID

DAVID SAID WHOEVER STRIKES THE JEBUSITES FIRST SHALL BE CHIEF AND COMMANDER

 AND JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH WENT UP FIRST SO HE BECAME CHIEF

AND DAVID LIVED IN THE STRONGHOLD; THEREFORE IT WAS CALLED THE CITY OF DAVID

AND HE BUILT THE CITY ALL AROUND FROM THE MILLO IN COMPLETE CIRCUIT AND JOAB REPAIRED THE REST OF THE CITY

AND DAVID BECAME GREATER AND GREATER FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS WAS WITH HIM

NOW THESE ARE THE CHIEFS OF DAVID'S MIGHTY MEN WHO GAVE HIM STRONG SUPPORT IN HIS KINGDOM TOGETHER WITH ALL ISRAEL TO MAKE HIM KING ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD CONCERNING ISRAEL

THIS IS AN ACCOUNT OF DAVID'S MIGHTY MEN JASHOBEAM A HACHMONITE WAS CHIEF OF THE THREE

HE WIELDED HIS SPEAR AGAINST  WHOM HE KILLED AT ONE TIME

AND NEXT TO HIM AMONG THE THREE MIGHTY MEN WAS ELEAZAR THE SON OF DODO THE AHOHITE

HE WAS WITH DAVID AT PASDAMMIM WHEN THE PHILISTINES WERE GATHERED THERE FOR BATTLE

THERE WAS A PLOT OF GROUND FULL OF BARLEY AND THE MEN FLED FROM THE PHILISTINES

BUT HE TOOK HIS STAND IN THE MIDST OF THE PLOT AND DEFENDED IT AND KILLED THE PHILISTINES

AND THE LORD SAVED THEM BY A GREAT VICTORY

THREE OF THE THIRTY CHIEF MEN WENT DOWN TO THE ROCK TO DAVID AT THE CAVE OF ADULLAM WHEN THE ARMY OF PHILISTINES WAS ENCAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

DAVID WAS THEN IN THE STRONGHOLD AND THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES WAS THEN AT BETHLEHEM

AND DAVID SAID LONGINGLY OH THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE ME WATER TO DRINK FROM THE WELL OF BETHLEHEM THAT IS BY THE GATE

 THEN THE THREE MIGHTY MEN BROKE THROUGH THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES AND DREW WATER OUT OF THE WELL OF BETHLEHEM THAT WAS BY THE GATE AND TOOK IT AND BROUGHT IT TO DAVID

BUT DAVID WOULD NOT DRINK IT

HE POURED IT OUT TO THE LORD AND SAID FAR BE IT FROM ME BEFORE MY GOD THAT I SHOULD DO THIS

SHALL I DRINK THE LIFEBLOOD OF THESE MEN

FOR AT THE RISK OF THEIR LIVES THEY BROUGHT IT

 THEREFORE HE WOULD NOT DRINK IT

THESE THINGS DID THE THREE MIGHTY MEN

NOW ABISHAI THE BROTHER OF JOAB WAS CHIEF OF THE THIRTY

AND HE WIELDED HIS SPEAR AGAINST  MEN AND KILLED THEM AND WON A NAME BESIDE THE THREE

HE WAS THE MOST RENOWNED OF THE THIRTY AND BECAME THEIR COMMANDER BUT HE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THE THREE

AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS A VALIANT MAN OF KABZEEL A DOER OF GREAT DEEDS

HE STRUCK DOWN TWO HEROES OF MOAB

HE ALSO WENT DOWN AND STRUCK DOWN A LION IN A PIT ON A DAY WHEN SNOW HAD FALLEN

AND HE STRUCK DOWN AN EGYPTIAN A MAN OF GREAT STATURE FIVE CUBITS TALL

THE EGYPTIAN HAD IN HIS HAND A SPEAR LIKE A WEAVER'S BEAM BUT BENAIAH WENT DOWN TO HIM WITH A STAFF AND SNATCHED THE SPEAR OUT OF THE EGYPTIAN'S HAND AND KILLED HIM WITH HIS OWN SPEAR

THESE THINGS DID BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA AND WON A NAME BESIDE THE THREE MIGHTY MEN

HE WAS RENOWNED AMONG THE THIRTY BUT HE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THE THREE

AND DAVID SET HIM OVER HIS BODYGUARD

THE MIGHTY MEN WERE ASAHEL THE BROTHER OF JOAB ELHANAN THE SON OF DODO OF BETHLEHEM SHAMMOTH OF HAROD HELEZ THE PELONITE IRA THE SON OF IKKESH OF TEKOA ABIEZER OF ANATHOTH SIBBECAI THE HUSHATHITE ILAI THE AHOHITE MAHARAI OF NETOPHAH HELED THE SON OF BAANAH OF NETOPHAH ITHAI THE SON OF RIBAI OF GIBEAH OF THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN BENAIAH OF PIRATHON HURAI OF THE BROOKS OF GAASH ABIEL THE ARBATHITE AZMAVETH OF BAHARUM ELIAHBA THE SHAALBONITE HASHEM THE GIZONITE JONATHAN THE SON OF SHAGEE THE HARARITE AHIAM THE SON OF SACHAR THE HARARITE ELIPHAL THE SON OF UR HEPHER THE MECHERATHITE AHIJAH THE PELONITE HEZRO OF CARMEL NAARAI THE SON OF EZBAI JOEL THE BROTHER OF NATHAN MIBHAR THE SON OF HAGRI ZELEK THE AMMONITE NAHARAI OF BEEROTH THE ARMORBEARER OF JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH IRA THE ITHRITE GAREB THE ITHRITE URIAH THE HITTITE ZABAD THE SON OF AHLAI ADINA THE SON OF SHIZA THE REUBENITE A LEADER OF THE REUBENITES AND THIRTY WITH HIM HANAN THE SON OF MAACAH AND JOSHAPHAT THE MITHNITE UZZIA THE ASHTERATHITE SHAMA AND JEIEL THE SONS OF HOTHAM THE AROERITE JEDIAEL THE SON OF SHIMRI AND JOHA HIS BROTHER THE TIZITE ELIEL THE MAHAVITE AND JERIBAI AND JOSHAVIAH THE SONS OF ELNAAM AND ITHMAH THE MOABITE ELIEL AND OBED AND JAASIEL THE MEZOBAITE

NOW THESE ARE THE MEN WHO CAME TO DAVID AT ZIKLAG WHILE HE COULD NOT MOVE ABOUT FREELY BECAUSE OF SAUL THE SON OF KISH

AND THEY WERE AMONG THE MIGHTY MEN WHO HELPED HIM IN WAR

THEY WERE BOWMEN AND COULD SHOOT ARROWS AND SLING STONES WITH EITHER THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT HAND; THEY WERE BENJAMINITES SAUL'S KINSMEN

THE CHIEF WAS AHIEZER THEN JOASH BOTH SONS OF SHEMAAH OF GIBEAH; ALSO JEZIEL AND PELET THE SONS OF AZMAVETH; BERACAH JEHU OF ANATHOTH ISHMAIAH OF GIBEON A MIGHTY MAN AMONG THE THIRTY AND A LEADER OVER THE THIRTY; JEREMIAH JAHAZIEL JOHANAN JOZABAD OF GEDERAH ELUZAI JERIMOTH BEALIAH SHEMARIAH SHEPHATIAH THE HARUPHITE; ELKANAH ISSHIAH AZAREL JOEZER AND JASHOBEAM THE KORAHITES; AND JOELAH AND ZEBADIAH THE SONS OF JEROHAM OF GEDOR

THESE GADITES WERE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY; THE LEAST WAS A MATCH FOR A HUNDRED MEN AND THE GREATEST FOR A THOUSAND

THESE ARE THE MEN WHO CROSSED THE JORDAN IN THE FIRST MONTH WHEN IT WAS OVERFLOWING ALL ITS BANKS AND PUT TO FLIGHT ALL THOSE IN THE VALLEYS TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST

AND SOME OF THE MEN OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH CAME TO THE STRONGHOLD TO DAVID

DAVID WENT OUT TO MEET THEM AND SAID TO THEM IF YOU HAVE COME TO ME IN FRIENDSHIP TO HELP ME MY HEART WILL BE JOINED TO YOU; BUT IF TO BETRAY ME TO MY ADVERSARIES ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO WRONG IN MY HANDS THEN MAY THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS SEE AND REBUKE YOU

 THEN THE SPIRIT CLOTHED AMASAI CHIEF OF THE THIRTY AND HE SAID WE ARE YOURS O DAVID AND WITH YOU O SON OF JESSE

PEACE PEACE TO YOU AND PEACE TO YOUR HELPERS

FOR YOUR GOD HELPS YOU

THEN DAVID RECEIVED THEM AND MADE THEM OFFICERS OF HIS TROOPS

SOME OF THE MEN OF MANASSEH DESERTED TO DAVID WHEN HE CAME WITH THE PHILISTINES FOR THE BATTLE AGAINST SAUL

YET HE DID NOT HELP THEM FOR THE RULERS OF THE PHILISTINES TOOK COUNSEL AND SENT HIM AWAY SAYING AT PERIL TO OUR HEADS HE WILL DESERT TO HIS MASTER SAUL

 AS HE WENT TO ZIKLAG THESE MEN OF MANASSEH DESERTED TO HIM ADNAH JOZABAD JEDIAEL MICHAEL JOZABAD ELIHU AND ZILLETHAI CHIEFS OF THOUSANDS IN MANASSEH

THEY HELPED DAVID AGAINST THE BAND OF RAIDERS FOR THEY WERE ALL MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR AND WERE COMMANDERS IN THE ARMY

FOR FROM DAY TO DAY MEN CAME TO DAVID TO HELP HIM UNTIL THERE WAS A GREAT ARMY LIKE AN ARMY OF GOD

THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE ARMED TROOPS WHO CAME TO DAVID IN HEBRON TO TURN THE KINGDOM OF SAUL OVER TO HIM ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

THE MEN OF JUDAH BEARING SHIELD AND SPEAR WERE  ARMED TROOPS

OF THE SIMEONITES MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR FOR WAR 

OF THE LEVITES 

THE PRINCE JEHOIADA OF THE HOUSE OF AARON AND WITH HIM 

ZADOK A YOUNG MAN MIGHTY IN VALOR AND TWENTYTWO COMMANDERS FROM HIS OWN FATHERS' HOUSE

OF THE BENJAMINITES THE KINSMEN OF SAUL  OF WHOM THE MAJORITY HAD TO THAT POINT KEPT THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO THE HOUSE OF SAUL

OF THE EPHRAIMITES  MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR FAMOUS MEN IN THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES

OF THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH  WHO WERE EXPRESSLY NAMED TO COME AND MAKE DAVID KING

OF ISSACHAR MEN WHO HAD UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES TO KNOW WHAT ISRAEL OUGHT TO DO  CHIEFS AND ALL THEIR KINSMEN UNDER THEIR COMMAND

OF ZEBULUN  SEASONED TROOPS EQUIPPED FOR BATTLE WITH ALL THE WEAPONS OF WAR TO HELP DAVID WITH SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE

OF NAPHTALI  COMMANDERS WITH WHOM WERE  MEN ARMED WITH SHIELD AND SPEAR

OF THE DANITES  MEN EQUIPPED FOR BATTLE

OF ASHER  SEASONED TROOPS READY FOR BATTLE

OF THE REUBENITES AND GADITES AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH FROM BEYOND THE JORDAN  MEN ARMED WITH ALL THE WEAPONS OF WAR

ALL THESE MEN OF WAR ARRAYED IN BATTLE ORDER CAME TO HEBRON WITH FULL INTENT TO MAKE DAVID KING OVER ALL ISRAEL

LIKEWISE ALL THE REST OF ISRAEL WERE OF A SINGLE MIND TO MAKE DAVID KING

AND THEY WERE THERE WITH DAVID FOR THREE DAYS EATING AND DRINKING FOR THEIR BROTHERS HAD MADE PREPARATION FOR THEM

AND ALSO THEIR RELATIVES FROM AS FAR AS ISSACHAR AND ZEBULUN AND NAPHTALI CAME BRINGING FOOD ON DONKEYS AND ON CAMELS AND ON MULES AND ON OXEN ABUNDANT PROVISIONS OF FLOUR CAKES OF FIGS CLUSTERS OF RAISINS AND WINE AND OIL OXEN AND SHEEP FOR THERE WAS JOY IN ISRAEL

DAVID CONSULTED WITH THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND OF HUNDREDS WITH EVERY LEADER

AND DAVID SAID TO ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU AND FROM THE LORD OUR GOD LET US SEND ABROAD TO OUR BROTHERS WHO REMAIN IN ALL THE LANDS OF ISRAEL AS WELL AS TO THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES IN THE CITIES THAT HAVE PASTURELANDS THAT THEY MAY BE GATHERED TO US

THEN LET US BRING AGAIN THE ARK OF OUR GOD TO US FOR WE DID NOT SEEK IT IN THE DAYS OF SAUL

 ALL THE ASSEMBLY AGREED TO DO SO FOR THE THING WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF ALL THE PEOPLE

SO DAVID ASSEMBLED ALL ISRAEL FROM THE NILE OF EGYPT TO LEBOHAMATH TO BRING THE ARK OF GOD FROM KIRIATHJEARIM

AND DAVID AND ALL ISRAEL WENT UP TO BAALAH THAT IS TO KIRIATHJEARIM THAT BELONGS TO JUDAH TO BRING UP FROM THERE THE ARK OF GOD WHICH IS CALLED BY THE NAME OF THE LORD WHO SITS ENTHRONED ABOVE THE CHERUBIM

AND THEY CARRIED THE ARK OF GOD ON A NEW CART FROM THE HOUSE OF ABINADAB AND UZZAH AND AHIO WERE DRIVING THE CART

AND DAVID AND ALL ISRAEL WERE REJOICING BEFORE GOD WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT WITH SONG AND LYRES AND HARPS AND TAMBOURINES AND CYMBALS AND TRUMPETS

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE THRESHING FLOOR OF CHIDON UZZAH PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE HOLD OF THE ARK FOR THE OXEN STUMBLED

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST UZZAH AND HE STRUCK HIM DOWN BECAUSE HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO THE ARK AND HE DIED THERE BEFORE GOD

AND DAVID WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THE LORD HAD BROKEN OUT AGAINST UZZAH

AND THAT PLACE IS CALLED PEREZUZZA TO THIS DAY

AND DAVID WAS AFRAID OF GOD THAT DAY AND HE SAID HOW CAN I BRING THE ARK OF GOD HOME TO ME

 SO DAVID DID NOT TAKE THE ARK HOME INTO THE CITY OF DAVID BUT TOOK IT ASIDE TO THE HOUSE OF OBEDEDOM THE GITTITE

AND THE ARK OF GOD REMAINED WITH THE HOUSEHOLD OF OBEDEDOM IN HIS HOUSE THREE MONTHS

AND THE LORD BLESSED THE HOUSEHOLD OF OBEDEDOM AND ALL THAT HE HAD

AND HIRAM KING OF TYRE SENT MESSENGERS TO DAVID AND CEDAR TREES ALSO MASONS AND CARPENTERS TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR HIM

AND DAVID KNEW THAT THE LORD HAD ESTABLISHED HIM AS KING OVER ISRAEL AND THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS HIGHLY EXALTED FOR THE SAKE OF HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND DAVID TOOK MORE WIVES IN JERUSALEM AND DAVID FATHERED MORE SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN BORN TO HIM IN JERUSALEM SHAMMUA SHOBAB NATHAN SOLOMON IBHAR ELISHUA ELPELET NOGAH NEPHEG JAPHIA ELISHAMA BEELIADA AND ELIPHELET

WHEN THE PHILISTINES HEARD THAT DAVID HAD BEEN ANOINTED KING OVER ALL ISRAEL ALL THE PHILISTINES WENT UP TO SEARCH FOR DAVID

BUT DAVID HEARD OF IT AND WENT OUT AGAINST THEM

NOW THE PHILISTINES HAD COME AND MADE A RAID IN THE VALLEY OF REPHAIM

AND DAVID INQUIRED OF GOD SHALL I GO UP AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

WILL YOU GIVE THEM INTO MY HAND

 AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM GO UP AND I WILL GIVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND

 AND HE WENT UP TO BAALPERAZIM AND DAVID STRUCK THEM DOWN THERE

AND DAVID SAID GOD HAS BROKEN THROUGH MY ENEMIES BY MY HAND LIKE A BURSTING FLOOD

 THEREFORE THE NAME OF THAT PLACE IS CALLED BAALPERAZIM

AND THEY LEFT THEIR GODS THERE AND DAVID GAVE COMMAND AND THEY WERE BURNED

AND THE PHILISTINES YET AGAIN MADE A RAID IN THE VALLEY

AND WHEN DAVID AGAIN INQUIRED OF GOD GOD SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL NOT GO UP AFTER THEM; GO AROUND AND COME AGAINST THEM OPPOSITE THE BALSAM TREES

AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF MARCHING IN THE TOPS OF THE BALSAM TREES THEN GO OUT TO BATTLE FOR GOD HAS GONE OUT BEFORE YOU TO STRIKE DOWN THE ARMY OF THE PHILISTINES

 AND DAVID DID AS GOD COMMANDED HIM AND THEY STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINE ARMY FROM GIBEON TO GEZER

AND THE FAME OF DAVID WENT OUT INTO ALL LANDS AND THE LORD BROUGHT THE FEAR OF HIM UPON ALL NATIONS

DAVID BUILT HOUSES FOR HIMSELF IN THE CITY OF DAVID

AND HE PREPARED A PLACE FOR THE ARK OF GOD AND PITCHED A TENT FOR IT

THEN DAVID SAID THAT NO ONE BUT THE LEVITES MAY CARRY THE ARK OF GOD FOR THE LORD HAD CHOSEN THEM TO CARRY THE ARK OF THE LORD AND TO MINISTER TO HIM FOREVER

AND DAVID ASSEMBLED ALL ISRAEL AT JERUSALEM TO BRING UP THE ARK OF THE LORD TO ITS PLACE WHICH HE HAD PREPARED FOR IT

AND DAVID GATHERED TOGETHER THE SONS OF AARON AND THE LEVITES OF THE SONS OF KOHATH URIEL THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS; OF THE SONS OF MERARI ASAIAH THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS; OF THE SONS OF GERSHOM JOEL THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS; OF THE SONS OF ELIZAPHAN SHEMAIAH THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS; OF THE SONS OF HEBRON ELIEL THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS; OF THE SONS OF UZZIEL AMMINADAB THE CHIEF WITH  OF HIS BROTHERS

THEN DAVID SUMMONED THE PRIESTS ZADOK AND ABIATHAR AND THE LEVITES URIEL ASAIAH JOEL SHEMAIAH ELIEL AND AMMINADAB AND SAID TO THEM YOU ARE THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE LEVITES

CONSECRATE YOURSELVES YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS SO THAT YOU MAY BRING UP THE ARK OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO THE PLACE THAT I HAVE PREPARED FOR IT

BECAUSE YOU DID NOT CARRY IT THE FIRST TIME THE LORD OUR GOD BROKE OUT AGAINST US BECAUSE WE DID NOT SEEK HIM ACCORDING TO THE RULE

 SO THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES CONSECRATED THEMSELVES TO BRING UP THE ARK OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

AND THE LEVITES CARRIED THE ARK OF GOD ON THEIR SHOULDERS WITH THE POLES AS MOSES HAD COMMANDED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

DAVID ALSO COMMANDED THE CHIEFS OF THE LEVITES TO APPOINT THEIR BROTHERS AS THE SINGERS WHO SHOULD PLAY LOUDLY ON MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ON HARPS AND LYRES AND CYMBALS TO RAISE SOUNDS OF JOY

SO THE LEVITES APPOINTED HEMAN THE SON OF JOEL; AND OF HIS BROTHERS ASAPH THE SON OF BERECHIAH; AND OF THE SONS OF MERARI THEIR BROTHERS ETHAN THE SON OF KUSHAIAH; AND WITH THEM THEIR BROTHERS OF THE SECOND ORDER ZECHARIAH JAAZIEL SHEMIRAMOTH JEHIEL UNNI ELIAB BENAIAH MAASEIAH MATTITHIAH ELIPHELEHU AND MIKNEIAH AND THE GATEKEEPERS OBEDEDOM AND JEIEL

THE SINGERS HEMAN ASAPH AND ETHAN WERE TO SOUND BRONZE CYMBALS; ZECHARIAH AZIEL SHEMIRAMOTH JEHIEL UNNI ELIAB MAASEIAH AND BENAIAH WERE TO PLAY HARPS ACCORDING TO ALAMOTH; BUT MATTITHIAH ELIPHELEHU MIKNEIAH OBEDEDOM JEIEL AND AZAZIAH WERE TO LEAD WITH LYRES ACCORDING TO THE SHEMINITH

CHENANIAH LEADER OF THE LEVITES IN MUSIC SHOULD DIRECT THE MUSIC FOR HE UNDERSTOOD IT

BERECHIAH AND ELKANAH WERE TO BE GATEKEEPERS FOR THE ARK

SHEBANIAH JOSHAPHAT NETHANEL AMASAI ZECHARIAH BENAIAH AND ELIEZER THE PRIESTS SHOULD BLOW THE TRUMPETS BEFORE THE ARK OF GOD

OBEDEDOM AND JEHIAH WERE TO BE GATEKEEPERS FOR THE ARK

SO DAVID AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS WENT TO BRING UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD FROM THE HOUSE OF OBEDEDOM WITH REJOICING

AND BECAUSE GOD HELPED THE LEVITES WHO WERE CARRYING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD THEY SACRIFICED SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS

DAVID WAS CLOTHED WITH A ROBE OF FINE LINEN AS ALSO WERE ALL THE LEVITES WHO WERE CARRYING THE ARK AND THE SINGERS AND CHENANIAH THE LEADER OF THE MUSIC OF THE SINGERS

AND DAVID WORE A LINEN EPHOD

SO ALL ISRAEL BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD WITH SHOUTING TO THE SOUND OF THE HORN TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS AND MADE LOUD MUSIC ON HARPS AND LYRES

AND AS THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD CAME TO THE CITY OF DAVID MICHAL THE DAUGHTER OF SAUL LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW KING DAVID DANCING AND REJOICING AND SHE DESPISED HIM IN HER HEART

AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE ARK OF GOD AND SET IT INSIDE THE TENT THAT DAVID HAD PITCHED FOR IT AND THEY OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS BEFORE GOD

AND WHEN DAVID HAD FINISHED OFFERING THE BURNT OFFERINGS AND THE PEACE OFFERINGS HE BLESSED THE PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD AND DISTRIBUTED TO ALL ISRAEL BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO EACH A LOAF OF BREAD A PORTION OF MEAT AND A CAKE OF RAISINS

THEN HE APPOINTED SOME OF THE LEVITES AS MINISTERS BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD TO INVOKE TO THANK AND TO PRAISE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

ASAPH WAS THE CHIEF AND SECOND TO HIM WERE ZECHARIAH JEIEL SHEMIRAMOTH JEHIEL MATTITHIAH ELIAB BENAIAH OBEDEDOM AND JEIEL WHO WERE TO PLAY HARPS AND LYRES; ASAPH WAS TO SOUND THE CYMBALS AND BENAIAH AND JAHAZIEL THE PRIESTS WERE TO BLOW TRUMPETS REGULARLY BEFORE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF GOD

THEN ON THAT DAY DAVID FIRST APPOINTED THAT THANKSGIVING BE SUNG TO THE LORD BY ASAPH AND HIS BROTHERS

OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD; CALL UPON HIS NAME; MAKE KNOWN HIS DEEDS AMONG THE PEOPLES

SING TO HIM; SING PRAISES TO HIM; TELL OF ALL HIS WONDROUS WORKS

GLORY IN HIS HOLY NAME; LET THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD REJOICE

SEEK THE LORD AND HIS STRENGTH; SEEK HIS PRESENCE CONTINUALLY

REMEMBER THE WONDROUS WORKS THAT HE HAS DONE HIS MIRACLES AND THE JUDGMENTS HE UTTERED O OFFSPRING OF ISRAEL HIS SERVANT SONS OF JACOB HIS CHOSEN ONES

HE IS THE LORD OUR GOD; HIS JUDGMENTS ARE IN ALL THE EARTH

REMEMBER HIS COVENANT FOREVER THE WORD THAT HE COMMANDED FOR A THOUSAND GENERATIONS THE COVENANT THAT HE MADE WITH ABRAHAM HIS SWORN PROMISE TO ISAAC WHICH HE CONFIRMED AS A STATUTE TO JACOB AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT TO ISRAEL SAYING TO YOU I WILL GIVE THE LAND OF CANAAN AS YOUR PORTION FOR AN INHERITANCE

 WHEN YOU WERE FEW IN NUMBER AND OF LITTLE ACCOUNT AND SOJOURNERS IN IT WANDERING FROM NATION TO NATION FROM ONE KINGDOM TO ANOTHER PEOPLE HE ALLOWED NO ONE TO OPPRESS THEM; HE REBUKED KINGS ON THEIR ACCOUNT SAYING TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED ONES DO MY PROPHETS NO HARM

 SING TO THE LORD ALL THE EARTH

TELL OF HIS SALVATION FROM DAY TO DAY

DECLARE HIS GLORY AMONG THE NATIONS HIS MARVELOUS WORKS AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES

FOR GREAT IS THE LORD AND GREATLY TO BE PRAISED AND HE IS TO BE HELD IN AWE ABOVE ALL GODS

FOR ALL THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES ARE IDOLS BUT THE LORD MADE THE HEAVENS

SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY ARE BEFORE HIM; STRENGTH AND JOY ARE IN HIS PLACE

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD O CLANS OF THE PEOPLES ASCRIBE TO THE LORD GLORY AND STRENGTH

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD THE GLORY DUE HIS NAME; BRING AN OFFERING AND COME BEFORE HIM

WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE SPLENDOR OF HOLINESS; TREMBLE BEFORE HIM ALL THE EARTH; YES THE WORLD IS ESTABLISHED; IT SHALL NEVER BE MOVED

LET THE HEAVENS BE GLAD AND LET THE EARTH REJOICE AND LET THEM SAY AMONG THE NATIONS THE LORD REIGNS

 LET THE SEA ROAR AND ALL THAT FILLS IT; LET THE FIELD EXULT AND EVERYTHING IN IT

THEN SHALL THE TREES OF THE FOREST SING FOR JOY BEFORE THE LORD FOR HE COMES TO JUDGE THE EARTH

OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD; FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

SAY ALSO SAVE US O GOD OF OUR SALVATION AND GATHER AND DELIVER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS THAT WE MAY GIVE THANKS TO YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE

BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAID AMEN

 AND PRAISED THE LORD

SO DAVID LEFT ASAPH AND HIS BROTHERS THERE BEFORE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TO MINISTER REGULARLY BEFORE THE ARK AS EACH DAY REQUIRED AND ALSO OBEDEDOM AND HIS SIXTYEIGHT BROTHERS WHILE OBEDEDOM THE SON OF JEDUTHUN AND HOSAH WERE TO BE GATEKEEPERS

AND HE LEFT ZADOK THE PRIEST AND HIS BROTHERS THE PRIESTS BEFORE THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD IN THE HIGH PLACE THAT WAS AT GIBEON TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD ON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING REGULARLY MORNING AND EVENING TO DO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF THE LORD THAT HE COMMANDED ISRAEL

WITH THEM WERE HEMAN AND JEDUTHUN AND THE REST OF THOSE CHOSEN AND EXPRESSLY NAMED TO GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

HEMAN AND JEDUTHUN HAD TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS FOR THE MUSIC AND INSTRUMENTS FOR SACRED SONG

THE SONS OF JEDUTHUN WERE APPOINTED TO THE GATE

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE DEPARTED EACH TO HIS HOUSE AND DAVID WENT HOME TO BLESS HIS HOUSEHOLD

NOW WHEN DAVID LIVED IN HIS HOUSE DAVID SAID TO NATHAN THE PROPHET BEHOLD I DWELL IN A HOUSE OF CEDAR BUT THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD IS UNDER A TENT

 AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID DO ALL THAT IS IN YOUR HEART FOR GOD IS WITH YOU

 BUT THAT SAME NIGHT THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO NATHAN GO AND TELL MY SERVANT DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD IT IS NOT YOU WHO WILL BUILD ME A HOUSE TO DWELL IN

FOR I HAVE NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE SINCE THE DAY I BROUGHT UP ISRAEL TO THIS DAY BUT I HAVE GONE FROM TENT TO TENT AND FROM DWELLING TO DWELLING

IN ALL PLACES WHERE I HAVE MOVED WITH ALL ISRAEL DID I SPEAK A WORD WITH ANY OF THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL WHOM I COMMANDED TO SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE SAYING WHY HAVE YOU NOT BUILT ME A HOUSE OF CEDAR

' NOW THEREFORE THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO MY SERVANT DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS I TOOK YOU FROM THE PASTURE FROM FOLLOWING THE SHEEP TO BE PRINCE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU HAVE GONE AND HAVE CUT OFF ALL YOUR ENEMIES FROM BEFORE YOU

AND I WILL MAKE FOR YOU A NAME LIKE THE NAME OF THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH

AND I WILL APPOINT A PLACE FOR MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND WILL PLANT THEM THAT THEY MAY DWELL IN THEIR OWN PLACE AND BE DISTURBED NO MORE

AND VIOLENT MEN SHALL WASTE THEM NO MORE AS FORMERLY FROM THE TIME THAT I APPOINTED JUDGES OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND I WILL SUBDUE ALL YOUR ENEMIES

MOREOVER I DECLARE TO YOU THAT THE LORD WILL BUILD YOU A HOUSE

WHEN YOUR DAYS ARE FULFILLED TO WALK WITH YOUR FATHERS I WILL RAISE UP YOUR OFFSPRING AFTER YOU ONE OF YOUR OWN SONS AND I WILL ESTABLISH HIS KINGDOM

HE SHALL BUILD A HOUSE FOR ME AND I WILL ESTABLISH HIS THRONE FOREVER

I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON

I WILL NOT TAKE MY STEADFAST LOVE FROM HIM AS I TOOK IT FROM HIM WHO WAS BEFORE YOU BUT I WILL CONFIRM HIM IN MY HOUSE AND IN MY KINGDOM FOREVER AND HIS THRONE SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER

' IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THESE WORDS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THIS VISION NATHAN SPOKE TO DAVID

THEN KING DAVID WENT IN AND SAT BEFORE THE LORD AND SAID WHO AM I O LORD GOD AND WHAT IS MY HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME THUS FAR

AND THIS WAS A SMALL THING IN YOUR EYES O GOD

YOU HAVE ALSO SPOKEN OF YOUR SERVANT'S HOUSE FOR A GREAT WHILE TO COME AND HAVE SHOWN ME FUTURE GENERATIONS O LORD GOD

AND WHAT MORE CAN DAVID SAY TO YOU FOR HONORING YOUR SERVANT

FOR YOU KNOW YOUR SERVANT

FOR YOUR SERVANT'S SAKE O LORD AND ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN HEART YOU HAVE DONE ALL THIS GREATNESS IN MAKING KNOWN ALL THESE GREAT THINGS

THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU O LORD AND THERE IS NO GOD BESIDES YOU ACCORDING TO ALL THAT WE HAVE HEARD WITH OUR EARS

AND WHO IS LIKE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL THE ONE NATION ON EARTH WHOM GOD WENT TO REDEEM TO BE HIS PEOPLE MAKING FOR YOURSELF A NAME FOR GREAT AND AWESOME THINGS IN DRIVING OUT NATIONS BEFORE YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU REDEEMED FROM EGYPT

AND YOU MADE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL TO BE YOUR PEOPLE FOREVER AND YOU O LORD BECAME THEIR GOD

AND NOW O LORD LET THE WORD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN CONCERNING YOUR SERVANT AND CONCERNING HIS HOUSE BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER AND DO AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND YOUR NAME WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND MAGNIFIED FOREVER SAYING 'THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL IS ISRAEL'S GOD' AND THE HOUSE OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID WILL BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE YOU

FOR YOU MY GOD HAVE REVEALED TO YOUR SERVANT THAT YOU WILL BUILD A HOUSE FOR HIM

THEREFORE YOUR SERVANT HAS FOUND COURAGE TO PRAY BEFORE YOU

AND NOW O LORD YOU ARE GOD AND YOU HAVE PROMISED THIS GOOD THING TO YOUR SERVANT

NOW YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO BLESS THE HOUSE OF YOUR SERVANT THAT IT MAY CONTINUE FOREVER BEFORE YOU FOR IT IS YOU O LORD WHO HAVE BLESSED AND IT IS BLESSED FOREVER

AFTER THIS DAVID DEFEATED THE PHILISTINES AND SUBDUED THEM AND HE TOOK GATH AND ITS VILLAGES OUT OF THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

AND HE DEFEATED MOAB AND THE MOABITES BECAME SERVANTS TO DAVID AND BROUGHT TRIBUTE

DAVID ALSO DEFEATED HADADEZER KING OF ZOBAHHAMATH AS HE WENT TO SET UP HIS MONUMENT AT THE RIVER EUPHRATES

AND DAVID TOOK FROM HIM  CHARIOTS  HORSEMEN AND  FOOT SOLDIERS

AND DAVID HAMSTRUNG ALL THE CHARIOT HORSES BUT LEFT ENOUGH FOR  CHARIOTS

AND WHEN THE SYRIANS OF DAMASCUS CAME TO HELP HADADEZER KING OF ZOBAH DAVID STRUCK DOWN  MEN OF THE SYRIANS

THEN DAVID PUT GARRISONS IN SYRIA OF DAMASCUS AND THE SYRIANS BECAME SERVANTS TO DAVID AND BROUGHT TRIBUTE

AND THE LORD GAVE VICTORY TO DAVID WHEREVER HE WENT

AND DAVID TOOK THE SHIELDS OF GOLD THAT WERE CARRIED BY THE SERVANTS OF HADADEZER AND BROUGHT THEM TO JERUSALEM

AND FROM TIBHATH AND FROM CUN CITIES OF HADADEZER DAVID TOOK A LARGE AMOUNT OF BRONZE

WITH IT SOLOMON MADE THE BRONZE SEA AND THE PILLARS AND THE VESSELS OF BRONZE

WHEN TOU KING OF HAMATH HEARD THAT DAVID HAD DEFEATED THE WHOLE ARMY OF HADADEZER KING OF ZOBAH HE SENT HIS SON HADORAM TO KING DAVID TO ASK ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND TO BLESS HIM BECAUSE HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST HADADEZER AND DEFEATED HIM; FOR HADADEZER HAD OFTEN BEEN AT WAR WITH TOU

AND HE SENT ALL SORTS OF ARTICLES OF GOLD OF SILVER AND OF BRONZE

THESE ALSO KING DAVID DEDICATED TO THE LORD TOGETHER WITH THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT HE HAD CARRIED OFF FROM ALL THE NATIONS FROM EDOM MOAB THE AMMONITES THE PHILISTINES AND AMALEK

AND ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH KILLED  EDOMITES IN THE VALLEY OF SALT

THEN HE PUT GARRISONS IN EDOM AND ALL THE EDOMITES BECAME DAVID'S SERVANTS

AND THE LORD GAVE VICTORY TO DAVID WHEREVER HE WENT

SO DAVID REIGNED OVER ALL ISRAEL AND HE ADMINISTERED JUSTICE AND EQUITY TO ALL HIS PEOPLE

AND JOAB THE SON OF ZERUIAH WAS OVER THE ARMY; AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF AHILUD WAS RECORDER; AND ZADOK THE SON OF AHITUB AND AHIMELECH THE SON OF ABIATHAR WERE PRIESTS; AND SHAVSHA WAS SECRETARY; AND BENAIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA WAS OVER THE CHERETHITES AND THE PELETHITES; AND DAVID'S SONS WERE THE CHIEF OFFICIALS IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING

NOW AFTER THIS NAHASH THE KING OF THE AMMONITES DIED AND HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AND DAVID SAID I WILL DEAL KINDLY WITH HANUN THE SON OF NAHASH FOR HIS FATHER DEALT KINDLY WITH ME

 SO DAVID SENT MESSENGERS TO CONSOLE HIM CONCERNING HIS FATHER

AND DAVID'S SERVANTS CAME TO THE LAND OF THE AMMONITES TO HANUN TO CONSOLE HIM

BUT THE PRINCES OF THE AMMONITES SAID TO HANUN DO YOU THINK BECAUSE DAVID HAS SENT COMFORTERS TO YOU THAT HE IS HONORING YOUR FATHER

HAVE NOT HIS SERVANTS COME TO YOU TO SEARCH AND TO OVERTHROW AND TO SPY OUT THE LAND

 SO HANUN TOOK DAVID'S SERVANTS AND SHAVED THEM AND CUT OFF THEIR GARMENTS IN THE MIDDLE AT THEIR HIPS AND SENT THEM AWAY; AND THEY DEPARTED

WHEN DAVID WAS TOLD CONCERNING THE MEN HE SENT MESSENGERS TO MEET THEM FOR THE MEN WERE GREATLY ASHAMED

AND THE KING SAID REMAIN AT JERICHO UNTIL YOUR BEARDS HAVE GROWN AND THEN RETURN

 WHEN THE AMMONITES SAW THAT THEY HAD BECOME A STENCH TO DAVID HANUN AND THE AMMONITES SENT  TALENTS OF SILVER TO HIRE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN FROM MESOPOTAMIA FROM ARAMMAACAH AND FROM ZOBAH

THEY HIRED  CHARIOTS AND THE KING OF MAACAH WITH HIS ARMY WHO CAME AND ENCAMPED BEFORE MEDEBA

AND THE AMMONITES WERE MUSTERED FROM THEIR CITIES AND CAME TO BATTLE

WHEN DAVID HEARD OF IT HE SENT JOAB AND ALL THE ARMY OF THE MIGHTY MEN

AND THE AMMONITES CAME OUT AND DREW UP IN BATTLE ARRAY AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITY AND THE KINGS WHO HAD COME WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY

WHEN JOAB SAW THAT THE BATTLE WAS SET AGAINST HIM BOTH IN FRONT AND IN THE REAR HE CHOSE SOME OF THE BEST MEN OF ISRAEL AND ARRAYED THEM AGAINST THE SYRIANS

THE REST OF HIS MEN HE PUT IN THE CHARGE OF ABISHAI HIS BROTHER AND THEY WERE ARRAYED AGAINST THE AMMONITES

AND HE SAID IF THE SYRIANS ARE TOO STRONG FOR ME THEN YOU SHALL HELP ME BUT IF THE AMMONITES ARE TOO STRONG FOR YOU THEN I WILL HELP YOU

BE STRONG AND LET US USE OUR STRENGTH FOR OUR PEOPLE AND FOR THE CITIES OF OUR GOD AND MAY THE LORD DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

 SO JOAB AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR BEFORE THE SYRIANS FOR BATTLE AND THEY FLED BEFORE HIM

AND WHEN THE AMMONITES SAW THAT THE SYRIANS FLED THEY LIKEWISE FLED BEFORE ABISHAI JOAB'S BROTHER AND ENTERED THE CITY

THEN JOAB CAME TO JERUSALEM

BUT WHEN THE SYRIANS SAW THAT THEY HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY ISRAEL THEY SENT MESSENGERS AND BROUGHT OUT THE SYRIANS WHO WERE BEYOND THE EUPHRATES WITH SHOPHACH THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF HADADEZER AT THEIR HEAD

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD TO DAVID HE GATHERED ALL ISRAEL TOGETHER AND CROSSED THE JORDAN AND CAME TO THEM AND DREW UP HIS FORCES AGAINST THEM

AND WHEN DAVID SET THE BATTLE IN ARRAY AGAINST THE SYRIANS THEY FOUGHT WITH HIM

AND THE SYRIANS FLED BEFORE ISRAEL AND DAVID KILLED OF THE SYRIANS THE MEN OF  CHARIOTS AND  FOOT SOLDIERS AND PUT TO DEATH ALSO SHOPHACH THE COMMANDER OF THEIR ARMY

AND WHEN THE SERVANTS OF HADADEZER SAW THAT THEY HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY ISRAEL THEY MADE PEACE WITH DAVID AND BECAME SUBJECT TO HIM

SO THE SYRIANS WERE NOT WILLING TO SAVE THE AMMONITES ANY MORE

IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR THE TIME WHEN KINGS GO OUT TO BATTLE JOAB LED OUT THE ARMY AND RAVAGED THE COUNTRY OF THE AMMONITES AND CAME AND BESIEGED RABBAH

BUT DAVID REMAINED AT JERUSALEM

AND JOAB STRUCK DOWN RABBAH AND OVERTHREW IT

AND DAVID TOOK THE CROWN OF THEIR KING FROM HIS HEAD

HE FOUND THAT IT WEIGHED A TALENT OF GOLD AND IN IT WAS A PRECIOUS STONE

AND IT WAS PLACED ON DAVID'S HEAD

AND HE BROUGHT OUT THE SPOIL OF THE CITY A VERY GREAT AMOUNT

AND HE BROUGHT OUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT AND SET THEM TO LABOR WITH SAWS AND IRON PICKS AND AXES

AND THUS DAVID DID TO ALL THE CITIES OF THE AMMONITES

THEN DAVID AND ALL THE PEOPLE RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

AND AFTER THIS THERE AROSE WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES AT GEZER

THEN SIBBECAI THE HUSHATHITE STRUCK DOWN SIPPAI WHO WAS ONE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THE GIANTS AND THE PHILISTINES WERE SUBDUED

AND THERE WAS AGAIN WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES AND ELHANAN THE SON OF JAIR STRUCK DOWN LAHMI THE BROTHER OF GOLIATH THE GITTITE THE SHAFT OF WHOSE SPEAR WAS LIKE A WEAVER'S BEAM

AND THERE WAS AGAIN WAR AT GATH WHERE THERE WAS A MAN OF GREAT STATURE WHO HAD SIX FINGERS ON EACH HAND AND SIX TOES ON EACH FOOT TWENTYFOUR IN NUMBER AND HE ALSO WAS DESCENDED FROM THE GIANTS

AND WHEN HE TAUNTED ISRAEL JONATHAN THE SON OF SHIMEA DAVID'S BROTHER STRUCK HIM DOWN

THESE WERE DESCENDED FROM THE GIANTS IN GATH AND THEY FELL BY THE HAND OF DAVID AND BY THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS

THEN SATAN STOOD AGAINST ISRAEL AND INCITED DAVID TO NUMBER ISRAEL

SO DAVID SAID TO JOAB AND THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY GO NUMBER ISRAEL FROM BEERSHEBA TO DAN AND BRING ME A REPORT THAT I MAY KNOW THEIR NUMBER

 BUT JOAB SAID MAY THE LORD ADD TO HIS PEOPLE A HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY AS THEY ARE

ARE THEY NOT MY LORD THE KING ALL OF THEM MY LORD'S SERVANTS

WHY THEN SHOULD MY LORD REQUIRE THIS

WHY SHOULD IT BE A CAUSE OF GUILT FOR ISRAEL

 BUT THE KING'S WORD PREVAILED AGAINST JOAB

SO JOAB DEPARTED AND WENT THROUGHOUT ALL ISRAEL AND CAME BACK TO JERUSALEM

AND JOAB GAVE THE SUM OF THE NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE TO DAVID

IN ALL ISRAEL THERE WERE  MEN WHO DREW THE SWORD AND IN JUDAH  WHO DREW THE SWORD

BUT HE DID NOT INCLUDE LEVI AND BENJAMIN IN THE NUMBERING FOR THE KING'S COMMAND WAS ABHORRENT TO JOAB

BUT GOD WAS DISPLEASED WITH THIS THING AND HE STRUCK ISRAEL

AND DAVID SAID TO GOD I HAVE SINNED GREATLY IN THAT I HAVE DONE THIS THING

BUT NOW PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE INIQUITY OF YOUR SERVANT FOR I HAVE ACTED VERY FOOLISHLY

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO GAD DAVID'S SEER SAYING GO AND SAY TO DAVID 'THUS SAYS THE LORD THREE THINGS I OFFER YOU; CHOOSE ONE OF THEM THAT I MAY DO IT TO YOU

' SO GAD CAME TO DAVID AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD 'CHOOSE WHAT YOU WILL EITHER THREE YEARS OF FAMINE OR THREE MONTHS OF DEVASTATION BY YOUR FOES WHILE THE SWORD OF YOUR ENEMIES OVERTAKES YOU OR ELSE THREE DAYS OF THE SWORD OF THE LORD PESTILENCE ON THE LAND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DESTROYING THROUGHOUT ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL

' NOW DECIDE WHAT ANSWER I SHALL RETURN TO HIM WHO SENT ME

 THEN DAVID SAID TO GAD I AM IN GREAT DISTRESS

LET ME FALL INTO THE HAND OF THE LORD FOR HIS MERCY IS VERY GREAT BUT DO NOT LET ME FALL INTO THE HAND OF MAN

 SO THE LORD SENT A PESTILENCE ON ISRAEL AND  MEN OF ISRAEL FELL

AND GOD SENT THE ANGEL TO JERUSALEM TO DESTROY IT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO DESTROY IT THE LORD SAW AND HE RELENTED FROM THE CALAMITY

AND HE SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO WAS WORKING DESTRUCTION IT IS ENOUGH; NOW STAY YOUR HAND

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WAS STANDING BY THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ORNAN THE JEBUSITE

AND DAVID LIFTED HIS EYES AND SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STANDING BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN AND IN HIS HAND A DRAWN SWORD STRETCHED OUT OVER JERUSALEM

THEN DAVID AND THE ELDERS CLOTHED IN SACKCLOTH FELL UPON THEIR FACES

AND DAVID SAID TO GOD WAS IT NOT I WHO GAVE COMMAND TO NUMBER THE PEOPLE

IT IS I WHO HAVE SINNED AND DONE GREAT EVIL

BUT THESE SHEEP WHAT HAVE THEY DONE

PLEASE LET YOUR HAND O LORD MY GOD BE AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY FATHER'S HOUSE

BUT DO NOT LET THE PLAGUE BE ON YOUR PEOPLE

 NOW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD HAD COMMANDED GAD TO SAY TO DAVID THAT DAVID SHOULD GO UP AND RAISE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD ON THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ORNAN THE JEBUSITE

SO DAVID WENT UP AT GAD'S WORD WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

NOW ORNAN WAS THRESHING WHEAT

HE TURNED AND SAW THE ANGEL AND HIS FOUR SONS WHO WERE WITH HIM HID THEMSELVES

AS DAVID CAME TO ORNAN ORNAN LOOKED AND SAW DAVID AND WENT OUT FROM THE THRESHING FLOOR AND PAID HOMAGE TO DAVID WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND

AND DAVID SAID TO ORNAN GIVE ME THE SITE OF THE THRESHING FLOOR THAT I MAY BUILD ON IT AN ALTAR TO THE LORDGIVE IT TO ME AT ITS FULL PRICETHAT THE PLAGUE MAY BE AVERTED FROM THE PEOPLE

 THEN ORNAN SAID TO DAVID TAKE IT AND LET MY LORD THE KING DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

SEE I GIVE THE OXEN FOR BURNT OFFERINGS AND THE THRESHING SLEDGES FOR THE WOOD AND THE WHEAT FOR A GRAIN OFFERING; I GIVE IT ALL

 BUT KING DAVID SAID TO ORNAN NO BUT I WILL BUY THEM FOR THE FULL PRICE

I WILL NOT TAKE FOR THE LORD WHAT IS YOURS NOR OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS THAT COST ME NOTHING

 SO DAVID PAID ORNAN  SHEKELS OF GOLD BY WEIGHT FOR THE SITE

AND DAVID BUILT THERE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD AND PRESENTED BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS AND CALLED ON THE LORD AND THE LORD ANSWERED HIM WITH FIRE FROM HEAVEN UPON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING

THEN THE LORD COMMANDED THE ANGEL AND HE PUT HIS SWORD BACK INTO ITS SHEATH

AT THAT TIME WHEN DAVID SAW THAT THE LORD HAD ANSWERED HIM AT THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ORNAN THE JEBUSITE HE SACRIFICED THERE

FOR THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD WHICH MOSES HAD MADE IN THE WILDERNESS AND THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING WERE AT THAT TIME IN THE HIGH PLACE AT GIBEON BUT DAVID COULD NOT GO BEFORE IT TO INQUIRE OF GOD FOR HE WAS AFRAID OF THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD

THEN DAVID SAID HERE SHALL BE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD GOD AND HERE THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING FOR ISRAEL

 DAVID COMMANDED TO GATHER TOGETHER THE RESIDENT ALIENS WHO WERE IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND HE SET STONECUTTERS TO PREPARE DRESSED STONES FOR BUILDING THE HOUSE OF GOD

DAVID ALSO PROVIDED GREAT QUANTITIES OF IRON FOR NAILS FOR THE DOORS OF THE GATES AND FOR CLAMPS AS WELL AS BRONZE IN QUANTITIES BEYOND WEIGHING AND CEDAR TIMBERS WITHOUT NUMBER FOR THE SIDONIANS AND TYRIANS BROUGHT GREAT QUANTITIES OF CEDAR TO DAVID

FOR DAVID SAID SOLOMON MY SON IS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED AND THE HOUSE THAT IS TO BE BUILT FOR THE LORD MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY MAGNIFICENT OF FAME AND GLORY THROUGHOUT ALL LANDS

I WILL THEREFORE MAKE PREPARATION FOR IT

 SO DAVID PROVIDED MATERIALS IN GREAT QUANTITY BEFORE HIS DEATH

THEN HE CALLED FOR SOLOMON HIS SON AND CHARGED HIM TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

DAVID SAID TO SOLOMON MY SON I HAD IT IN MY HEART TO BUILD A HOUSE TO THE NAME OF THE LORD MY GOD

BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING 'YOU HAVE SHED MUCH BLOOD AND HAVE WAGED GREAT WARS

YOU SHALL NOT BUILD A HOUSE TO MY NAME BECAUSE YOU HAVE SHED SO MUCH BLOOD BEFORE ME ON THE EARTH

BEHOLD A SON SHALL BE BORN TO YOU WHO SHALL BE A MAN OF REST

I WILL GIVE HIM REST FROM ALL HIS SURROUNDING ENEMIES

FOR HIS NAME SHALL BE SOLOMON AND I WILL GIVE PEACE AND QUIET TO ISRAEL IN HIS DAYS

HE SHALL BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME

HE SHALL BE MY SON AND I WILL BE HIS FATHER AND I WILL ESTABLISH HIS ROYAL THRONE IN ISRAEL FOREVER

' NOW MY SON THE LORD BE WITH YOU SO THAT YOU MAY SUCCEED IN BUILDING THE HOUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AS HE HAS SPOKEN CONCERNING YOU

ONLY MAY THE LORD GRANT YOU DISCRETION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN HE GIVES YOU CHARGE OVER ISRAEL YOU MAY KEEP THE LAW OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

THEN YOU WILL PROSPER IF YOU ARE CAREFUL TO OBSERVE THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES FOR ISRAEL

BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

FEAR NOT; DO NOT BE DISMAYED

WITH GREAT PAINS I HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD  TALENTS OF GOLD A MILLION TALENTS OF SILVER AND BRONZE AND IRON BEYOND WEIGHING FOR THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT; TIMBER AND STONE TOO I HAVE PROVIDED

TO THESE YOU MUST ADD

YOU HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF WORKMEN STONECUTTERS MASONS CARPENTERS AND ALL KINDS OF CRAFTSMEN WITHOUT NUMBER SKILLED IN WORKING GOLD SILVER BRONZE AND IRON

ARISE AND WORK

I HAD IT IN MY HEART TO BUILD A HOUSE OF REST FOR THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD AND FOR THE FOOTSTOOL OF OUR GOD AND I MADE PREPARATIONS FOR BUILDING

BUT GOD SAID TO ME 'YOU MAY NOT BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME FOR YOU ARE A MAN OF WAR AND HAVE SHED BLOOD

YOURS IS THE KINGDOM O LORD AND YOU ARE EXALTED AS HEAD ABOVE ALL

BOTH RICHES AND HONOR COME FROM YOU AND YOU RULE OVER ALL

IN YOUR HAND ARE POWER AND MIGHT AND IN YOUR HAND IT IS TO MAKE GREAT AND TO GIVE STRENGTH TO ALL

AND NOW WE THANK YOU OUR GOD AND PRAISE YOUR GLORIOUS NAME

BUT WHO AM I AND WHAT IS MY PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE THUS TO OFFER WILLINGLY

FOR ALL THINGS COME FROM YOU AND OF YOUR OWN HAVE WE GIVEN YOU

FOR WE ARE STRANGERS BEFORE YOU AND SOJOURNERS AS ALL OUR FATHERS WERE

OUR DAYS ON THE EARTH ARE LIKE A SHADOW AND THERE IS NO ABIDING

O LORD OUR GOD ALL THIS ABUNDANCE THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR BUILDING YOU A HOUSE FOR YOUR HOLY NAME COMES FROM YOUR HAND AND IS ALL YOUR OWN

I KNOW MY GOD THAT YOU TEST THE HEART AND HAVE PLEASURE IN UPRIGHTNESS

IN THE UPRIGHTNESS OF MY HEART I HAVE FREELY OFFERED ALL THESE THINGS AND NOW I HAVE SEEN YOUR PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESENT HERE OFFERING FREELY AND JOYOUSLY TO YOU

O LORD THE GOD OF ABRAHAM ISAAC AND ISRAEL OUR FATHERS KEEP FOREVER SUCH PURPOSES AND THOUGHTS IN THE HEARTS OF YOUR PEOPLE AND DIRECT THEIR HEARTS TOWARD YOU

GRANT TO SOLOMON MY SON A WHOLE HEART THAT HE MAY KEEP YOUR COMMANDMENTS YOUR TESTIMONIES AND YOUR STATUTES PERFORMING ALL AND THAT HE MAY BUILD THE PALACE FOR WHICH I HAVE MADE PROVISION

 THEN DAVID SAID TO ALL THE ASSEMBLY BLESS THE LORD YOUR GOD

 AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY BLESSED THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND BOWED THEIR HEADS AND PAID HOMAGE TO THE LORD AND TO THE KING

AND THEY ATE AND DRANK BEFORE THE LORD ON THAT DAY WITH GREAT GLADNESS

AND THEY ATE AND DRANK BEFORE THE LORD ON THAT DAY WITH GREAT GLADNESS

THEN SOLOMON SAT ON THE THRONE OF THE LORD AS KING IN PLACE OF DAVID HIS FATHER

AND HE PROSPERED AND ALL ISRAEL OBEYED HIM

ALL THE LEADERS AND THE MIGHTY MEN AND ALSO ALL THE SONS OF KING DAVID PLEDGED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO KING SOLOMON

AND THE LORD MADE SOLOMON VERY GREAT IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL AND BESTOWED ON HIM SUCH ROYAL MAJESTY AS HAD NOT BEEN ON ANY KING BEFORE HIM IN ISRAEL

THUS DAVID THE SON OF JESSE REIGNED OVER ALL ISRAEL

THE TIME THAT HE REIGNED OVER ISRAEL WAS FORTY YEARS

HE REIGNED SEVEN YEARS IN HEBRON AND THIRTYTHREE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

THEN HE DIED AT A GOOD AGE FULL OF DAYS RICHES AND HONOR

AND SOLOMON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

NOW THE ACTS OF KING DAVID FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE WRITTEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF SAMUEL THE SEER AND IN THE CHRONICLES OF NATHAN THE PROPHET AND IN THE CHRONICLES OF GAD THE SEER WITH ACCOUNTS OF ALL HIS RULE AND HIS MIGHT AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAME UPON HIM AND UPON ISRAEL AND UPON ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE COUNTRIES

 TIMOTHYPAUL AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS BY COMMAND OF GOD OUR SAVIOR AND OF CHRIST JESUS OUR HOPE TO TIMOTHY MY TRUE CHILD IN THE FAITHGRACE MERCY AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD

AS I URGED YOU WHEN I WAS GOING TO MACEDONIA REMAIN AT EPHESUS THAT YOU MAY CHARGE CERTAIN PERSONS NOT TO TEACH ANY DIFFERENT DOCTRINE NOR TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO MYTHS AND ENDLESS GENEALOGIES WHICH PROMOTE SPECULATIONS RATHER THAN THE STEWARDSHIP FROM GOD THAT IS BY FAITH

THE AIM OF OUR CHARGE IS LOVE THAT ISSUES FROM A PURE HEART AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE AND A SINCERE FAITH

CERTAIN PERSONS BY SWERVING FROM THESE HAVE WANDERED AWAY INTO VAIN DISCUSSION DESIRING TO BE TEACHERS OF THE LAW WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING EITHER WHAT THEY ARE SAYING OR THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH THEY MAKE CONFIDENT ASSERTIONS

NOW WE KNOW THAT THE LAW IS GOOD IF ONE USES IT LAWFULLY UNDERSTANDING THIS THAT THE LAW IS NOT LAID DOWN FOR THE JUST BUT FOR THE LAWLESS AND DISOBEDIENT FOR THE UNGODLY AND SINNERS FOR THE UNHOLY AND PROFANE FOR THOSE WHO STRIKE THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS FOR MURDERERS THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL MEN WHO PRACTICE HOMOSEXUALITY ENSLAVERS LIARS PERJURERS AND WHATEVER ELSE IS CONTRARY TO SOUND DOCTRINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL OF THE BLESSED GOD WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED

I THANK HIM WHO HAS GIVEN ME STRENGTH CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD BECAUSE HE JUDGED ME FAITHFUL APPOINTING ME TO HIS SERVICE THOUGH FORMERLY I WAS A BLASPHEMER PERSECUTOR AND INSOLENT OPPONENT

BUT I RECEIVED MERCY BECAUSE I HAD ACTED IGNORANTLY IN UNBELIEF AND THE GRACE OF OUR LORD OVERFLOWED FOR ME WITH THE FAITH AND LOVE THAT ARE IN CHRIST JESUS

THE SAYING IS TRUSTWORTHY AND DESERVING OF FULL ACCEPTANCE THAT CHRIST JESUS CAME INTO THE WORLD TO SAVE SINNERS OF WHOM I AM THE FOREMOST

BUT I RECEIVED MERCY FOR THIS REASON THAT IN ME AS THE FOREMOST JESUS CHRIST MIGHT DISPLAY HIS PERFECT PATIENCE AS AN EXAMPLE TO THOSE WHO WERE TO BELIEVE IN HIM FOR ETERNAL LIFE

TO THE KING OF AGES IMMORTAL INVISIBLE THE ONLY GOD BE HONOR AND GLORY FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

THIS CHARGE I ENTRUST TO YOU TIMOTHY MY CHILD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROPHECIES PREVIOUSLY MADE ABOUT YOU THAT BY THEM YOU MAY WAGE THE GOOD WARFARE HOLDING FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE

BY REJECTING THIS SOME HAVE MADE SHIPWRECK OF THEIR FAITH AMONG WHOM ARE HYMENAEUS AND ALEXANDER WHOM I HAVE HANDED OVER TO SATAN THAT THEY MAY LEARN NOT TO BLASPHEME

FIRST OF ALL THEN I URGE THAT SUPPLICATIONS PRAYERS INTERCESSIONS AND THANKSGIVINGS BE MADE FOR ALL PEOPLE FOR KINGS AND ALL WHO ARE IN HIGH POSITIONS THAT WE MAY LEAD A PEACEFUL AND QUIET LIFE GODLY AND DIGNIFIED IN EVERY WAY

THIS IS GOOD AND IT IS PLEASING IN THE SIGHT OF GOD OUR SAVIOR WHO DESIRES ALL PEOPLE TO BE SAVED AND TO COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH

FOR THERE IS ONE GOD AND THERE IS ONE MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND MEN THE MAN CHRIST JESUS WHO GAVE HIMSELF AS A RANSOM FOR ALL WHICH IS THE TESTIMONY GIVEN AT THE PROPER TIME

FOR THIS I WAS APPOINTED A PREACHER AND AN APOSTLE I AM TELLING THE TRUTH I AM NOT LYING A TEACHER OF THE GENTILES IN FAITH AND TRUTH

I DESIRE THEN THAT IN EVERY PLACE THE MEN SHOULD PRAY LIFTING HOLY HANDS WITHOUT ANGER OR QUARRELING; LIKEWISE ALSO THAT WOMEN SHOULD ADORN THEMSELVES IN RESPECTABLE APPAREL WITH MODESTY AND SELFCONTROL NOT WITH BRAIDED HAIR AND GOLD OR PEARLS OR COSTLY ATTIRE BUT WITH WHAT IS PROPER FOR WOMEN WHO PROFESS GODLINESSWITH GOOD WORKS

LET A WOMAN LEARN QUIETLY WITH ALL SUBMISSIVENESS

I DO NOT PERMIT A WOMAN TO TEACH OR TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER A MAN; RATHER SHE IS TO REMAIN QUIET

FOR ADAM WAS FORMED FIRST THEN EVE; AND ADAM WAS NOT DECEIVED BUT THE WOMAN WAS DECEIVED AND BECAME A TRANSGRESSOR

YET SHE WILL BE SAVED THROUGH CHILDBEARINGIF THEY CONTINUE IN FAITH AND LOVE AND HOLINESS WITH SELFCONTROL

THE SAYING IS TRUSTWORTHY IF ANYONE ASPIRES TO THE OFFICE OF OVERSEER HE DESIRES A NOBLE TASK

THEREFORE AN OVERSEER MUST BE ABOVE REPROACH THE HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE SOBERMINDED SELFCONTROLLED RESPECTABLE HOSPITABLE ABLE TO TEACH NOT A DRUNKARD NOT VIOLENT BUT GENTLE NOT QUARRELSOME NOT A LOVER OF MONEY

HE MUST MANAGE HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD WELL WITH ALL DIGNITY KEEPING HIS CHILDREN SUBMISSIVE FOR IF SOMEONE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD HOW WILL HE CARE FOR GOD'S CHURCH

HE MUST NOT BE A RECENT CONVERT OR HE MAY BECOME PUFFED UP WITH CONCEIT AND FALL INTO THE CONDEMNATION OF THE DEVIL

MOREOVER HE MUST BE WELL THOUGHT OF BY OUTSIDERS SO THAT HE MAY NOT FALL INTO DISGRACE INTO A SNARE OF THE DEVIL

DEACONS LIKEWISE MUST BE DIGNIFIED NOT DOUBLETONGUED NOT ADDICTED TO MUCH WINE NOT GREEDY FOR DISHONEST GAIN

THEY MUST HOLD THE MYSTERY OF THE FAITH WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE

AND LET THEM ALSO BE TESTED FIRST; THEN LET THEM SERVE AS DEACONS IF THEY PROVE THEMSELVES BLAMELESS

THEIR WIVES LIKEWISE MUST BE DIGNIFIED NOT SLANDERERS BUT SOBERMINDED FAITHFUL IN ALL THINGS

LET DEACONS EACH BE THE HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE MANAGING THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLDS WELL

FOR THOSE WHO SERVE WELL AS DEACONS GAIN A GOOD STANDING FOR THEMSELVES AND ALSO GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE FAITH THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS

I HOPE TO COME TO YOU SOON BUT I AM WRITING THESE THINGS TO YOU SO THAT IF I DELAY YOU MAY KNOW HOW ONE OUGHT TO BEHAVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD WHICH IS THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD A PILLAR AND BUTTRESS OF TRUTH

GREAT INDEED WE CONFESS IS THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS HE WAS MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH VINDICATED BY THE SPIRIT SEEN BY ANGELS PROCLAIMED AMONG THE NATIONS BELIEVED ON IN THE WORLD TAKEN UP IN GLORY

NOW THE SPIRIT EXPRESSLY SAYS THAT IN LATER TIMES SOME WILL DEPART FROM THE FAITH BY DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO DECEITFUL SPIRITS AND TEACHINGS OF DEMONS THROUGH THE INSINCERITY OF LIARS WHOSE CONSCIENCES ARE SEARED WHO FORBID MARRIAGE AND REQUIRE ABSTINENCE FROM FOODS THAT GOD CREATED TO BE RECEIVED WITH THANKSGIVING BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND KNOW THE TRUTH

FOR EVERYTHING CREATED BY GOD IS GOOD AND NOTHING IS TO BE REJECTED IF IT IS RECEIVED WITH THANKSGIVING FOR IT IS MADE HOLY BY THE WORD OF GOD AND PRAYER

IF YOU PUT THESE THINGS BEFORE THE BROTHERS YOU WILL BE A GOOD SERVANT OF CHRIST JESUS BEING TRAINED IN THE WORDS OF THE FAITH AND OF THE GOOD DOCTRINE THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED

HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IRREVERENT SILLY MYTHS

RATHER TRAIN YOURSELF FOR GODLINESS; FOR WHILE BODILY TRAINING IS OF SOME VALUE GODLINESS IS OF VALUE IN EVERY WAY AS IT HOLDS PROMISE FOR THE PRESENT LIFE AND ALSO FOR THE LIFE TO COME

THE SAYING IS TRUSTWORTHY AND DESERVING OF FULL ACCEPTANCE

FOR TO THIS END WE TOIL AND STRIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR HOPE SET ON THE LIVING GOD WHO IS THE SAVIOR OF ALL PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE

COMMAND AND TEACH THESE THINGS

LET NO ONE DESPISE YOU FOR YOUR YOUTH BUT SET THE BELIEVERS AN EXAMPLE IN SPEECH IN CONDUCT IN LOVE IN FAITH IN PURITY

UNTIL I COME DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THE PUBLIC READING OF SCRIPTURE TO EXHORTATION TO TEACHING

DO NOT NEGLECT THE GIFT YOU HAVE WHICH WAS GIVEN YOU BY PROPHECY WHEN THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS LAID THEIR HANDS ON YOU

PRACTICE THESE THINGS DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THEM SO THAT ALL MAY SEE YOUR PROGRESS

KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON YOURSELF AND ON THE TEACHING

PERSIST IN THIS FOR BY SO DOING YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOURSELF AND YOUR HEARERS

DO NOT REBUKE AN OLDER MAN BUT ENCOURAGE HIM AS YOU WOULD A FATHER

TREAT YOUNGER MEN LIKE BROTHERS OLDER WOMEN LIKE MOTHERS YOUNGER WOMEN LIKE SISTERS IN ALL PURITY

HONOR WIDOWS WHO ARE TRULY WIDOWS

BUT IF A WIDOW HAS CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN LET THEM FIRST LEARN TO SHOW GODLINESS TO THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLD AND TO MAKE SOME RETURN TO THEIR PARENTS FOR THIS IS PLEASING IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

SHE WHO IS TRULY A WIDOW LEFT ALL ALONE HAS SET HER HOPE ON GOD AND CONTINUES IN SUPPLICATIONS AND PRAYERS NIGHT AND DAY BUT SHE WHO IS SELFINDULGENT IS DEAD EVEN WHILE SHE LIVES

COMMAND THESE THINGS AS WELL SO THAT THEY MAY BE WITHOUT REPROACH

BUT IF ANYONE DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR HIS RELATIVES AND ESPECIALLY FOR MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD HE HAS DENIED THE FAITH AND IS WORSE THAN AN UNBELIEVER

LET A WIDOW BE ENROLLED IF SHE IS NOT LESS THAN SIXTY YEARS OF AGE HAVING BEEN THE WIFE OF ONE HUSBAND AND HAVING A REPUTATION FOR GOOD WORKS IF SHE HAS BROUGHT UP CHILDREN HAS SHOWN HOSPITALITY HAS WASHED THE FEET OF THE SAINTS HAS CARED FOR THE AFFLICTED AND HAS DEVOTED HERSELF TO EVERY GOOD WORK

BUT REFUSE TO ENROLL YOUNGER WIDOWS FOR WHEN THEIR PASSIONS DRAW THEM AWAY FROM CHRIST THEY DESIRE TO MARRY AND SO INCUR CONDEMNATION FOR HAVING ABANDONED THEIR FORMER FAITH

BESIDES THAT THEY LEARN TO BE IDLERS GOING ABOUT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AND NOT ONLY IDLERS BUT ALSO GOSSIPS AND BUSYBODIES SAYING WHAT THEY SHOULD NOT

SO I WOULD HAVE YOUNGER WIDOWS MARRY BEAR CHILDREN MANAGE THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AND GIVE THE ADVERSARY NO OCCASION FOR SLANDER

FOR SOME HAVE ALREADY STRAYED AFTER SATAN

IF ANY BELIEVING WOMAN HAS RELATIVES WHO ARE WIDOWS LET HER CARE FOR THEM

LET THE CHURCH NOT BE BURDENED SO THAT IT MAY CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE REALLY WIDOWS

LET THE ELDERS WHO RULE WELL BE CONSIDERED WORTHY OF DOUBLE HONOR ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LABOR IN PREACHING AND TEACHING

FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE AN OX WHEN IT TREADS OUT THE GRAIN AND THE LABORER DESERVES HIS WAGES

 DO NOT ADMIT A CHARGE AGAINST AN ELDER EXCEPT ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES

AS FOR THOSE WHO PERSIST IN SIN REBUKE THEM IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL SO THAT THE REST MAY STAND IN FEAR

IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND OF CHRIST JESUS AND OF THE ELECT ANGELS I CHARGE YOU TO KEEP THESE RULES WITHOUT PREJUDGING DOING NOTHING FROM PARTIALITY

DO NOT BE HASTY IN THE LAYING ON OF HANDS NOR TAKE PART IN THE SINS OF OTHERS; KEEP YOURSELF PURE

NO LONGER DRINK ONLY WATER BUT USE A LITTLE WINE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR STOMACH AND YOUR FREQUENT AILMENTS

 THE SINS OF SOME MEN ARE CONSPICUOUS GOING BEFORE THEM TO JUDGMENT BUT THE SINS OF OTHERS APPEAR LATER

SO ALSO GOOD WORKS ARE CONSPICUOUS AND EVEN THOSE THAT ARE NOT CANNOT REMAIN HIDDEN

LET ALL WHO ARE UNDER A YOKE AS SLAVES REGARD THEIR OWN MASTERS AS WORTHY OF ALL HONOR SO THAT THE NAME OF GOD AND THE TEACHING MAY NOT BE REVILED

THOSE WHO HAVE BELIEVING MASTERS MUST NOT BE DISRESPECTFUL ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE BROTHERS; RATHER THEY MUST SERVE ALL THE BETTER SINCE THOSE WHO BENEFIT BY THEIR GOOD SERVICE ARE BELIEVERS AND BELOVED

TEACH AND URGE THESE THINGS

IF ANYONE TEACHES A DIFFERENT DOCTRINE AND DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE SOUND WORDS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TEACHING THAT ACCORDS WITH GODLINESS HE IS PUFFED UP WITH CONCEIT AND UNDERSTANDS NOTHING

HE HAS AN UNHEALTHY CRAVING FOR CONTROVERSY AND FOR QUARRELS ABOUT WORDS WHICH PRODUCE ENVY DISSENSION SLANDER EVIL SUSPICIONS AND CONSTANT FRICTION AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRAVED IN MIND AND DEPRIVED OF THE TRUTH IMAGINING THAT GODLINESS IS A MEANS OF GAIN

NOW THERE IS GREAT GAIN IN GODLINESS WITH CONTENTMENT FOR WE BROUGHT NOTHING INTO THE WORLD AND WE CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF THE WORLD

BUT IF WE HAVE FOOD AND CLOTHING WITH THESE WE WILL BE CONTENT

BUT THOSE WHO DESIRE TO BE RICH FALL INTO TEMPTATION INTO A SNARE INTO MANY SENSELESS AND HARMFUL DESIRES THAT PLUNGE PEOPLE INTO RUIN AND DESTRUCTION

FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY IS A ROOT OF ALL KINDS OF EVILS

IT IS THROUGH THIS CRAVING THAT SOME HAVE WANDERED AWAY FROM THE FAITH AND PIERCED THEMSELVES WITH MANY PANGS

BUT AS FOR YOU O MAN OF GOD FLEE THESE THINGS

PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS GODLINESS FAITH LOVE STEADFASTNESS GENTLENESS

FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH

TAKE HOLD OF THE ETERNAL LIFE TO WHICH YOU WERE CALLED AND ABOUT WHICH YOU MADE THE GOOD CONFESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY WITNESSES

I CHARGE YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WHO GIVES LIFE TO ALL THINGS AND OF CHRIST JESUS WHO IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE PONTIUS PILATE MADE THE GOOD CONFESSION TO KEEP THE COMMANDMENT UNSTAINED AND FREE FROM REPROACH UNTIL THE APPEARING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHICH HE WILL DISPLAY AT THE PROPER TIMEHE WHO IS THE BLESSED AND ONLY SOVEREIGN THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS WHO ALONE HAS IMMORTALITY WHO DWELLS IN UNAPPROACHABLE LIGHT WHOM NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN OR CAN SEE

TO HIM BE HONOR AND ETERNAL DOMINION

AMEN

AS FOR THE RICH IN THIS PRESENT AGE CHARGE THEM NOT TO BE HAUGHTY NOR TO SET THEIR HOPES ON THE UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES BUT ON GOD WHO RICHLY PROVIDES US WITH EVERYTHING TO ENJOY

THEY ARE TO DO GOOD TO BE RICH IN GOOD WORKS TO BE GENEROUS AND READY TO SHARE THUS STORING UP TREASURE FOR THEMSELVES AS A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT THEY MAY TAKE HOLD OF THAT WHICH IS TRULY LIFE

O TIMOTHY GUARD THE DEPOSIT ENTRUSTED TO YOU

AVOID THE IRREVERENT BABBLE AND CONTRADICTIONS OF WHAT IS FALSELY CALLED KNOWLEDGE FOR BY PROFESSING IT SOME HAVE SWERVED FROM THE FAITH

GRACE BE WITH YOU

ALL WHO ARE CLEAN MAY EAT FLESH BUT THE PERSON WHO EATS OF THE FLESH OF THE SACRIFICE OF THE LORD'S PEACE OFFERINGS WHILE AN UNCLEANNESS IS ON HIM THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE

AND IF ANYONE TOUCHES AN UNCLEAN THING WHETHER HUMAN UNCLEANNESS OR AN UNCLEAN BEAST OR ANY UNCLEAN DETESTABLE CREATURE AND THEN EATS SOME FLESH FROM THE SACRIFICE OF THE LORD'S PEACE OFFERINGS THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE

 THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAYING YOU SHALL EAT NO FAT OF OX OR SHEEP OR GOAT

THE FAT OF AN ANIMAL THAT DIES OF ITSELF AND THE FAT OF ONE THAT IS TORN BY BEASTS MAY BE PUT TO ANY OTHER USE BUT ON NO ACCOUNT SHALL YOU EAT IT

FOR EVERY PERSON WHO EATS OF THE FAT OF AN ANIMAL OF WHICH A FOOD OFFERING MAY BE MADE TO THE LORD SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE

MOREOVER YOU SHALL EAT NO BLOOD WHATEVER WHETHER OF FOWL OR OF ANIMAL IN ANY OF YOUR DWELLING PLACES

WHOEVER EATS ANY BLOOD THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE

 THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAYING WHOEVER OFFERS THE SACRIFICE OF HIS PEACE OFFERINGS TO THE LORD SHALL BRING HIS OFFERING TO THE LORD FROM THE SACRIFICE OF HIS PEACE OFFERINGS

HIS OWN HANDS SHALL BRING THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS

HE SHALL BRING THE FAT WITH THE BREAST THAT THE BREAST MAY BE WAVED AS A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD

THE PRIEST SHALL BURN THE FAT ON THE ALTAR BUT THE BREAST SHALL BE FOR AARON AND HIS SONS

AND THE RIGHT THIGH YOU SHALL GIVE TO THE PRIEST AS A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE SACRIFICE OF YOUR PEACE OFFERINGS

WHOEVER AMONG THE SONS OF AARON OFFERS THE BLOOD OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS AND THE FAT SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT THIGH FOR A PORTION

FOR THE BREAST THAT IS WAVED AND THE THIGH THAT IS CONTRIBUTED I HAVE TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OUT OF THE SACRIFICES OF THEIR PEACE OFFERINGS AND HAVE GIVEN THEM TO AARON THE PRIEST AND TO HIS SONS AS A PERPETUAL DUE FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THIS IS THE PORTION OF AARON AND OF HIS SONS FROM THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS FROM THE DAY THEY WERE PRESENTED TO SERVE AS PRIESTS OF THE LORD

THE LORD COMMANDED THIS TO BE GIVEN THEM BY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM THE DAY THAT HE ANOINTED THEM

IT IS A PERPETUAL DUE THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS

 THIS IS THE LAW OF THE BURNT OFFERING OF THE GRAIN OFFERING OF THE SIN OFFERING OF THE GUILT OFFERING OF THE ORDINATION OFFERING AND OF THE PEACE OFFERING WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI ON THE DAY THAT HE COMMANDED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO BRING THEIR OFFERINGS TO THE LORD IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS WITH HIM AND THE GARMENTS AND THE ANOINTING OIL AND THE BULL OF THE SIN OFFERING AND THE TWO RAMS AND THE BASKET OF UNLEAVENED BREAD

AND ASSEMBLE ALL THE CONGREGATION AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

 AND MOSES DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED HIM AND THE CONGREGATION WAS ASSEMBLED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

AND MOSES SAID TO THE CONGREGATION THIS IS THE THING THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED TO BE DONE

 AND MOSES BROUGHT AARON AND HIS SONS AND WASHED THEM WITH WATER

AND HE PUT THE COAT ON HIM AND TIED THE SASH AROUND HIS WAIST AND CLOTHED HIM WITH THE ROBE AND PUT THE EPHOD ON HIM AND TIED THE SKILLFULLY WOVEN BAND OF THE EPHOD AROUND HIM BINDING IT TO HIM WITH THE BAND

AND HE PLACED THE BREASTPIECE ON HIM AND IN THE BREASTPIECE HE PUT THE URIM AND THE THUMMIM

AND HE SET THE TURBAN ON HIS HEAD AND ON THE TURBAN IN FRONT HE SET THE GOLDEN PLATE THE HOLY CROWN AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN MOSES TOOK THE ANOINTING OIL AND ANOINTED THE TABERNACLE AND ALL THAT WAS IN IT AND CONSECRATED THEM

AND HE SPRINKLED SOME OF IT ON THE ALTAR SEVEN TIMES AND ANOINTED THE ALTAR AND ALL ITS UTENSILS AND THE BASIN AND ITS STAND TO CONSECRATE THEM

AND HE POURED SOME OF THE ANOINTING OIL ON AARON'S HEAD AND ANOINTED HIM TO CONSECRATE HIM

AND MOSES BROUGHT AARON'S SONS AND CLOTHED THEM WITH COATS AND TIED SASHES AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND BOUND CAPS ON THEM AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN HE BROUGHT THE BULL OF THE SIN OFFERING AND AARON AND HIS SONS LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEAD OF THE BULL OF THE SIN OFFERING

AND HE KILLED IT AND MOSES TOOK THE BLOOD AND WITH HIS FINGER PUT IT ON THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR AROUND IT AND PURIFIED THE ALTAR AND POURED OUT THE BLOOD AT THE BASE OF THE ALTAR AND CONSECRATED IT TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR IT

AND HE TOOK ALL THE FAT THAT WAS ON THE ENTRAILS AND THE LONG LOBE OF THE LIVER AND THE TWO KIDNEYS WITH THEIR FAT AND MOSES BURNED THEM ON THE ALTAR

BUT THE BULL AND ITS SKIN AND ITS FLESH AND ITS DUNG HE BURNED UP WITH FIRE OUTSIDE THE CAMP AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN HE PRESENTED THE RAM OF THE BURNT OFFERING AND AARON AND HIS SONS LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEAD OF THE RAM

AND HE KILLED IT AND MOSES THREW THE BLOOD AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE ALTAR

HE CUT THE RAM INTO PIECES AND MOSES BURNED THE HEAD AND THE PIECES AND THE FAT

HE WASHED THE ENTRAILS AND THE LEGS WITH WATER AND MOSES BURNED THE WHOLE RAM ON THE ALTAR

IT WAS A BURNT OFFERING WITH A PLEASING AROMA A FOOD OFFERING FOR THE LORD AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN HE PRESENTED THE OTHER RAM THE RAM OF ORDINATION AND AARON AND HIS SONS LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEAD OF THE RAM

AND HE KILLED IT AND MOSES TOOK SOME OF ITS BLOOD AND PUT IT ON THE LOBE OF AARON'S RIGHT EAR AND ON THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON THE BIG TOE OF HIS RIGHT FOOT

THEN HE PRESENTED AARON'S SONS AND MOSES PUT SOME OF THE BLOOD ON THE LOBES OF THEIR RIGHT EARS AND ON THE THUMBS OF THEIR RIGHT HANDS AND ON THE BIG TOES OF THEIR RIGHT FEET

AND MOSES THREW THE BLOOD AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE ALTAR

THEN HE TOOK THE FAT AND THE FAT TAIL AND ALL THE FAT THAT WAS ON THE ENTRAILS AND THE LONG LOBE OF THE LIVER AND THE TWO KIDNEYS WITH THEIR FAT AND THE RIGHT THIGH AND OUT OF THE BASKET OF UNLEAVENED BREAD THAT WAS BEFORE THE LORD HE TOOK ONE UNLEAVENED LOAF AND ONE LOAF OF BREAD WITH OIL AND ONE WAFER AND PLACED THEM ON THE PIECES OF FAT AND ON THE RIGHT THIGH

AND HE PUT ALL THESE IN THE HANDS OF AARON AND IN THE HANDS OF HIS SONS AND WAVED THEM AS A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD

THEN MOSES TOOK THEM FROM THEIR HANDS AND BURNED THEM ON THE ALTAR WITH THE BURNT OFFERING

THIS WAS AN ORDINATION OFFERING WITH A PLEASING AROMA A FOOD OFFERING TO THE LORD

AND MOSES TOOK THE BREAST AND WAVED IT FOR A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD

IT WAS MOSES' PORTION OF THE RAM OF ORDINATION AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN MOSES TOOK SOME OF THE ANOINTING OIL AND OF THE BLOOD THAT WAS ON THE ALTAR AND SPRINKLED IT ON AARON AND HIS GARMENTS AND ALSO ON HIS SONS AND HIS SONS' GARMENTS

SO HE CONSECRATED AARON AND HIS GARMENTS AND HIS SONS AND HIS SONS' GARMENTS WITH HIM

AND MOSES SAID TO AARON AND HIS SONS BOIL THE FLESH AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING AND THERE EAT IT AND THE BREAD THAT IS IN THE BASKET OF ORDINATION OFFERINGS AS I COMMANDED SAYING 'AARON AND HIS SONS SHALL EAT IT

' AND WHAT REMAINS OF THE FLESH AND THE BREAD YOU SHALL BURN UP WITH FIRE

AND YOU SHALL NOT GO OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING FOR SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE DAYS OF YOUR ORDINATION ARE COMPLETED FOR IT WILL TAKE SEVEN DAYS TO ORDAIN YOU

AS HAS BEEN DONE TODAY THE LORD HAS COMMANDED TO BE DONE TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOU

AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING YOU SHALL REMAIN DAY AND NIGHT FOR SEVEN DAYS PERFORMING WHAT THE LORD HAS CHARGED SO THAT YOU DO NOT DIE FOR SO I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED

 AND AARON AND HIS SONS DID ALL THE THINGS THAT THE LORD COMMANDED BY MOSES

ON THE EIGHTH DAY MOSES CALLED AARON AND HIS SONS AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND HE SAID TO AARON TAKE FOR YOURSELF A BULL CALF FOR A SIN OFFERING AND A RAM FOR A BURNT OFFERING BOTH WITHOUT BLEMISH AND OFFER THEM BEFORE THE LORD

AND SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL 'TAKE A MALE GOAT FOR A SIN OFFERING AND A CALF AND A LAMB BOTH A YEAR OLD WITHOUT BLEMISH FOR A BURNT OFFERING AND AN OX AND A RAM FOR PEACE OFFERINGS TO SACRIFICE BEFORE THE LORD AND A GRAIN OFFERING MIXED WITH OIL FOR TODAY THE LORD WILL APPEAR TO YOU

' AND THEY BROUGHT WHAT MOSES COMMANDED IN FRONT OF THE TENT OF MEETING AND ALL THE CONGREGATION DREW NEAR AND STOOD BEFORE THE LORD

AND MOSES SAID THIS IS THE THING THAT THE LORD COMMANDED YOU TO DO THAT THE GLORY OF THE LORD MAY APPEAR TO YOU

 THEN MOSES SAID TO AARON DRAW NEAR TO THE ALTAR AND OFFER YOUR SIN OFFERING AND YOUR BURNT OFFERING AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOURSELF AND FOR THE PEOPLE AND BRING THE OFFERING OF THE PEOPLE AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THEM AS THE LORD HAS COMMANDED

 SO AARON DREW NEAR TO THE ALTAR AND KILLED THE CALF OF THE SIN OFFERING WHICH WAS FOR HIMSELF

AND THE SONS OF AARON PRESENTED THE BLOOD TO HIM AND HE DIPPED HIS FINGER IN THE BLOOD AND PUT IT ON THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR AND POURED OUT THE BLOOD AT THE BASE OF THE ALTAR

BUT THE FAT AND THE KIDNEYS AND THE LONG LOBE OF THE LIVER FROM THE SIN OFFERING HE BURNED ON THE ALTAR AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THE FLESH AND THE SKIN HE BURNED UP WITH FIRE OUTSIDE THE CAMP

THEN HE KILLED THE BURNT OFFERING AND AARON'S SONS HANDED HIM THE BLOOD AND HE THREW IT AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE ALTAR

AND THEY HANDED THE BURNT OFFERING TO HIM PIECE BY PIECE AND THE HEAD AND HE BURNED THEM ON THE ALTAR

AND HE WASHED THE ENTRAILS AND THE LEGS AND BURNED THEM WITH THE BURNT OFFERING ON THE ALTAR

THEN HE PRESENTED THE PEOPLE'S OFFERING AND TOOK THE GOAT OF THE SIN OFFERING THAT WAS FOR THE PEOPLE AND KILLED IT AND OFFERED IT AS A SIN OFFERING LIKE THE FIRST ONE

AND HE PRESENTED THE BURNT OFFERING AND OFFERED IT ACCORDING TO THE RULE

AND HE PRESENTED THE GRAIN OFFERING TOOK A HANDFUL OF IT AND BURNED IT ON THE ALTAR BESIDES THE BURNT OFFERING OF THE MORNING

THEN HE KILLED THE OX AND THE RAM THE SACRIFICE OF PEACE OFFERINGS FOR THE PEOPLE

AND AARON'S SONS HANDED HIM THE BLOOD AND HE THREW IT AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE ALTAR

BUT THE FAT PIECES OF THE OX AND OF THE RAM THE FAT TAIL AND THAT WHICH COVERS THE ENTRAILS AND THE KIDNEYS AND THE LONG LOBE OF THE LIVER THEY PUT THE FAT PIECES ON THE BREASTS AND HE BURNED THE FAT PIECES ON THE ALTAR BUT THE BREASTS AND THE RIGHT THIGH AARON WAVED FOR A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD AS MOSES COMMANDED

THEN AARON LIFTED UP HIS HANDS TOWARD THE PEOPLE AND BLESSED THEM AND HE CAME DOWN FROM OFFERING THE SIN OFFERING AND THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE PEACE OFFERINGS

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT THEY BLESSED THE PEOPLE AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED TO ALL THE PEOPLE

AND FIRE CAME OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE PIECES OF FAT ON THE ALTAR AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAW IT THEY SHOUTED AND FELL ON THEIR FACES

NOW NADAB AND ABIHU THE SONS OF AARON EACH TOOK HIS CENSER AND PUT FIRE IN IT AND LAID INCENSE ON IT AND OFFERED UNAUTHORIZED FIRE BEFORE THE LORD WHICH HE HAD NOT COMMANDED THEM

AND FIRE CAME OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM AND THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD

THEN MOSES SAID TO AARON THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS SAID 'AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NEAR ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED AND BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE I WILL BE GLORIFIED

' AND AARON HELD HIS PEACE

AND MOSES CALLED MISHAEL AND ELZAPHAN THE SONS OF UZZIEL THE UNCLE OF AARON AND SAID TO THEM COME NEAR; CARRY YOUR BROTHERS AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE SANCTUARY AND OUT OF THE CAMP

 SO THEY CAME NEAR AND CARRIED THEM IN THEIR COATS OUT OF THE CAMP AS MOSES HAD SAID

AND MOSES SAID TO AARON AND TO ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR HIS SONS DO NOT LET THE HAIR OF YOUR HEADS HANG LOOSE AND DO NOT TEAR YOUR CLOTHES LEST YOU DIE AND WRATH COME UPON ALL THE CONGREGATION; BUT LET YOUR BROTHERS THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BEWAIL THE BURNING THAT THE LORD HAS KINDLED

AND DO NOT GO OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING LEST YOU DIE FOR THE ANOINTING OIL OF THE LORD IS UPON YOU

 AND THEY DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO AARON SAYING DRINK NO WINE OR STRONG DRINK YOU OR YOUR SONS WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING LEST YOU DIE

IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOREVER THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS

YOU ARE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE HOLY AND THE COMMON AND BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN AND YOU ARE TO TEACH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ALL THE STATUTES THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN TO THEM BY MOSES

 MOSES SPOKE TO AARON AND TO ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR HIS SURVIVING SONS TAKE THE GRAIN OFFERING THAT IS LEFT OF THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS AND EAT IT UNLEAVENED BESIDE THE ALTAR FOR IT IS MOST HOLY

YOU SHALL EAT IT IN A HOLY PLACE BECAUSE IT IS YOUR DUE AND YOUR SONS' DUE FROM THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS FOR SO I AM COMMANDED

BUT THE BREAST THAT IS WAVED AND THE THIGH THAT IS CONTRIBUTED YOU SHALL EAT IN A CLEAN PLACE YOU AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS WITH YOU FOR THEY ARE GIVEN AS YOUR DUE AND YOUR SONS' DUE FROM THE SACRIFICES OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THE THIGH THAT IS CONTRIBUTED AND THE BREAST THAT IS WAVED THEY SHALL BRING WITH THE FOOD OFFERINGS OF THE FAT PIECES TO WAVE FOR A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD AND IT SHALL BE YOURS AND YOUR SONS' WITH YOU AS A DUE FOREVER AS THE LORD HAS COMMANDED

 NOW MOSES DILIGENTLY INQUIRED ABOUT THE GOAT OF THE SIN OFFERING AND BEHOLD IT WAS BURNED UP

AND HE WAS ANGRY WITH ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR THE SURVIVING SONS OF AARON SAYING WHY HAVE YOU NOT EATEN THE SIN OFFERING IN THE PLACE OF THE SANCTUARY SINCE IT IS A THING MOST HOLY AND HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU THAT YOU MAY BEAR THE INIQUITY OF THE CONGREGATION TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THEM BEFORE THE LORD

BEHOLD ITS BLOOD WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE INNER PART OF THE SANCTUARY

YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE EATEN IT IN THE SANCTUARY AS I COMMANDED

 AND AARON SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD TODAY THEY HAVE OFFERED THEIR SIN OFFERING AND THEIR BURNT OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD AND YET SUCH THINGS AS THESE HAVE HAPPENED TO ME

IF I HAD EATEN THE SIN OFFERING TODAY WOULD THE LORD HAVE APPROVED

 AND WHEN MOSES HEARD THAT HE APPROVED

' I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAVE SEPARATED YOU FROM THE PEOPLES

YOU SHALL THEREFORE SEPARATE THE CLEAN BEAST FROM THE UNCLEAN AND THE UNCLEAN BIRD FROM THE CLEAN

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE YOURSELVES DETESTABLE BY BEAST OR BY BIRD OR BY ANYTHING WITH WHICH THE GROUND CRAWLS WHICH I HAVE SET APART FOR YOU TO HOLD UNCLEAN

HE SHALL NOT MAKE HIMSELF UNCLEAN AS A HUSBAND AMONG HIS PEOPLE AND SO PROFANE HIMSELF

THEY SHALL NOT MAKE BALD PATCHES ON THEIR HEADS NOR SHAVE OFF THE EDGES OF THEIR BEARDS NOR MAKE ANY CUTS ON THEIR BODY

THEY SHALL BE HOLY TO THEIR GOD AND NOT PROFANE THE NAME OF THEIR GOD

FOR THEY OFFER THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS THE BREAD OF THEIR GOD; THEREFORE THEY SHALL BE HOLY

THEY SHALL NOT MARRY A PROSTITUTE OR A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DEFILED NEITHER SHALL THEY MARRY A WOMAN DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND FOR THE PRIEST IS HOLY TO HIS GOD

YOU SHALL SANCTIFY HIM FOR HE OFFERS THE BREAD OF YOUR GOD

HE SHALL BE HOLY TO YOU FOR I THE LORD WHO SANCTIFY YOU AM HOLY

AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY PRIEST IF SHE PROFANES HERSELF BY WHORING PROFANES HER FATHER; SHE SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE

THE PRIEST WHO IS CHIEF AMONG HIS BROTHERS ON WHOSE HEAD THE ANOINTING OIL IS POURED AND WHO HAS BEEN CONSECRATED TO WEAR THE GARMENTS SHALL NOT LET THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD HANG LOOSE NOR TEAR HIS CLOTHES

HE SHALL NOT GO IN TO ANY DEAD BODIES NOR MAKE HIMSELF UNCLEAN EVEN FOR HIS FATHER OR FOR HIS MOTHER

HE SHALL NOT GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY LEST HE PROFANE THE SANCTUARY OF HIS GOD FOR THE CONSECRATION OF THE ANOINTING OIL OF HIS GOD IS ON HIM I AM THE LORD

AND HE SHALL TAKE A WIFE IN HER VIRGINITY

A WIDOW OR A DIVORCED WOMAN OR A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DEFILED OR A PROSTITUTE THESE HE SHALL NOT MARRY

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO AARON SAYING NONE OF YOUR OFFSPRING THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS WHO HAS A BLEMISH MAY APPROACH TO OFFER THE BREAD OF HIS GOD

FOR NO ONE WHO HAS A BLEMISH SHALL DRAW NEAR A MAN BLIND OR LAME OR ONE WHO HAS A MUTILATED FACE OR A LIMB TOO LONG OR A MAN WHO HAS AN INJURED FOOT OR AN INJURED HAND OR A HUNCHBACK OR A DWARF OR A MAN WITH A DEFECT IN HIS SIGHT OR AN ITCHING DISEASE OR SCABS OR CRUSHED TESTICLES

NO MAN OF THE OFFSPRING OF AARON THE PRIEST WHO HAS A BLEMISH SHALL COME NEAR TO OFFER THE LORD'S FOOD OFFERINGS; SINCE HE HAS A BLEMISH HE SHALL NOT COME NEAR TO OFFER THE BREAD OF HIS GOD

HE MAY EAT THE BREAD OF HIS GOD BOTH OF THE MOST HOLY AND OF THE HOLY THINGS BUT HE SHALL NOT GO THROUGH THE VEIL OR APPROACH THE ALTAR BECAUSE HE HAS A BLEMISH THAT HE MAY NOT PROFANE MY SANCTUARIES FOR I AM THE LORD WHO SANCTIFIES THEM

 SO MOSES SPOKE TO AARON AND TO HIS SONS AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO AARON AND HIS SONS SO THAT THEY ABSTAIN FROM THE HOLY THINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH THEY DEDICATE TO ME SO THAT THEY DO NOT PROFANE MY HOLY NAME I AM THE LORD

SAY TO THEM 'IF ANY ONE OF ALL YOUR OFFSPRING THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS APPROACHES THE HOLY THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEDICATE TO THE LORD WHILE HE HAS AN UNCLEANNESS THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM MY PRESENCE I AM THE LORD

WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN HE SHALL BE CLEAN AND AFTERWARD HE MAY EAT OF THE HOLY THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS FOOD

HE SHALL NOT EAT WHAT DIES OF ITSELF OR IS TORN BY BEASTS AND SO MAKE HIMSELF UNCLEAN BY IT I AM THE LORD

' THEY SHALL THEREFORE KEEP MY CHARGE LEST THEY BEAR SIN FOR IT AND DIE THEREBY WHEN THEY PROFANE IT I AM THE LORD WHO SANCTIFIES THEM

A LAY PERSON SHALL NOT EAT OF A HOLY THING; NO FOREIGN GUEST OF THE PRIEST OR HIRED SERVANT SHALL EAT OF A HOLY THING BUT IF A PRIEST BUYS A SLAVE AS HIS PROPERTY FOR MONEY THE SLAVE MAY EAT OF IT AND ANYONE BORN IN HIS HOUSE MAY EAT OF HIS FOOD

IF A PRIEST'S DAUGHTER MARRIES A LAYMAN SHE SHALL NOT EAT OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE HOLY THINGS

BUT IF A PRIEST'S DAUGHTER IS WIDOWED OR DIVORCED AND HAS NO CHILD AND RETURNS TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE AS IN HER YOUTH SHE MAY EAT OF HER FATHER'S FOOD; YET NO LAY PERSON SHALL EAT OF IT

AND IF ANYONE EATS OF A HOLY THING UNINTENTIONALLY HE SHALL ADD THE FIFTH OF ITS VALUE TO IT AND GIVE THE HOLY THING TO THE PRIEST

THEY SHALL NOT PROFANE THE HOLY THINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE LORD AND SO CAUSE THEM TO BEAR INIQUITY AND GUILT BY EATING THEIR HOLY THINGS FOR I AM THE LORD WHO SANCTIFIES THEM

ANY ANIMAL THAT HAS ITS TESTICLES BRUISED OR CRUSHED OR TORN OR CUT YOU SHALL NOT OFFER TO THE LORD; YOU SHALL NOT DO IT WITHIN YOUR LAND NEITHER SHALL YOU OFFER AS THE BREAD OF YOUR GOD ANY SUCH ANIMALS GOTTEN FROM A FOREIGNER

SINCE THERE IS A BLEMISH IN THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR MUTILATION THEY WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR YOU

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING WHEN AN OX OR SHEEP OR GOAT IS BORN IT SHALL REMAIN SEVEN DAYS WITH ITS MOTHER AND FROM THE EIGHTH DAY ON IT SHALL BE ACCEPTABLE AS A FOOD OFFERING TO THE LORD

AND WHEN YOU SACRIFICE A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING TO THE LORD YOU SHALL SACRIFICE IT SO THAT YOU MAY BE ACCEPTED

IT SHALL BE EATEN ON THE SAME DAY; YOU SHALL LEAVE NONE OF IT UNTIL MORNING I AM THE LORD

IF THE VOW IS AN ANIMAL THAT MAY BE OFFERED AS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD ALL OF IT THAT HE GIVES TO THE LORD IS HOLY

HE SHALL NOT EXCHANGE IT OR MAKE A SUBSTITUTE FOR IT GOOD FOR BAD OR BAD FOR GOOD; AND IF HE DOES IN FACT SUBSTITUTE ONE ANIMAL FOR ANOTHER THEN BOTH IT AND THE SUBSTITUTE SHALL BE HOLY

AND IF IT IS ANY UNCLEAN ANIMAL THAT MAY NOT BE OFFERED AS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD THEN HE SHALL STAND THE ANIMAL BEFORE THE PRIEST AND THE PRIEST SHALL VALUE IT AS EITHER GOOD OR BAD; AS THE PRIEST VALUES IT SO IT SHALL BE

BUT IF HE WISHES TO REDEEM IT HE SHALL ADD A FIFTH TO THE VALUATION

WHEN A MAN DEDICATES HIS HOUSE AS A HOLY GIFT TO THE LORD THE PRIEST SHALL VALUE IT AS EITHER GOOD OR BAD; AS THE PRIEST VALUES IT SO IT SHALL STAND

AND IF THE DONOR WISHES TO REDEEM HIS HOUSE HE SHALL ADD A FIFTH TO THE VALUATION PRICE AND IT SHALL BE HIS

IF A MAN DEDICATES TO THE LORD PART OF THE LAND THAT IS HIS POSSESSION THEN THE VALUATION SHALL BE IN PROPORTION TO ITS SEED

A HOMER OF BARLEY SEED SHALL BE VALUED AT FIFTY SHEKELS OF SILVER

IF HE DEDICATES HIS FIELD FROM THE YEAR OF JUBILEE THE VALUATION SHALL STAND BUT IF HE DEDICATES HIS FIELD AFTER THE JUBILEE THEN THE PRIEST SHALL CALCULATE THE PRICE ACCORDING TO THE YEARS THAT REMAIN UNTIL THE YEAR OF JUBILEE AND A DEDUCTION SHALL BE MADE FROM THE VALUATION

AND IF HE WHO DEDICATES THE FIELD WISHES TO REDEEM IT THEN HE SHALL ADD A FIFTH TO ITS VALUATION PRICE AND IT SHALL REMAIN HIS

BUT IF HE DOES NOT WISH TO REDEEM THE FIELD OR IF HE HAS SOLD THE FIELD TO ANOTHER MAN IT SHALL NOT BE REDEEMED ANYMORE

BUT THE FIELD WHEN IT IS RELEASED IN THE JUBILEE SHALL BE A HOLY GIFT TO THE LORD LIKE A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN DEVOTED

THE PRIEST SHALL BE IN POSSESSION OF IT

IF HE DEDICATES TO THE LORD A FIELD THAT HE HAS BOUGHT WHICH IS NOT A PART OF HIS POSSESSION THEN THE PRIEST SHALL CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION FOR IT UP TO THE YEAR OF JUBILEE AND THE MAN SHALL GIVE THE VALUATION ON THAT DAY AS A HOLY GIFT TO THE LORD

IN THE YEAR OF JUBILEE THE FIELD SHALL RETURN TO HIM FROM WHOM IT WAS BOUGHT TO WHOM THE LAND BELONGS AS A POSSESSION

EVERY VALUATION SHALL BE ACCORDING TO THE SHEKEL OF THE SANCTUARY TWENTY GERAHS SHALL MAKE A SHEKEL

BUT A FIRSTBORN OF ANIMALS WHICH AS A FIRSTBORN BELONGS TO THE LORD NO MAN MAY DEDICATE; WHETHER OX OR SHEEP IT IS THE LORD'S

AND IF IT IS AN UNCLEAN ANIMAL THEN HE SHALL BUY IT BACK AT THE VALUATION AND ADD A FIFTH TO IT; OR IF IT IS NOT REDEEMED IT SHALL BE SOLD AT THE VALUATION

BUT NO DEVOTED THING THAT A MAN DEVOTES TO THE LORD OF ANYTHING THAT HE HAS WHETHER MAN OR BEAST OR OF HIS INHERITED FIELD SHALL BE SOLD OR REDEEMED; EVERY DEVOTED THING IS MOST HOLY TO THE LORD

NO ONE DEVOTED WHO IS TO BE DEVOTED FOR DESTRUCTION FROM MANKIND SHALL BE RANSOMED; HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH

EVERY TITHE OF THE LAND WHETHER OF THE SEED OF THE LAND OR OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES IS THE LORD'S; IT IS HOLY TO THE LORD

IF A MAN WISHES TO REDEEM SOME OF HIS TITHE HE SHALL ADD A FIFTH TO IT

AND EVERY TITHE OF HERDS AND FLOCKS EVERY TENTH ANIMAL OF ALL THAT PASS UNDER THE HERDSMAN'S STAFF SHALL BE HOLY TO THE LORD

ONE SHALL NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GOOD OR BAD NEITHER SHALL HE MAKE A SUBSTITUTE FOR IT; AND IF HE DOES SUBSTITUTE FOR IT THEN BOTH IT AND THE SUBSTITUTE SHALL BE HOLY; IT SHALL NOT BE REDEEMED

 THESE ARE THE COMMANDMENTS THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ON MOUNT SINAI

 PETERPETER AN APOSTLE OF JESUS CHRIST TO THOSE WHO ARE ELECT EXILES OF THE DISPERSION IN PONTUS GALATIA CAPPADOCIA ASIA AND BITHYNIA ACCORDING TO THE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF GOD THE FATHER IN THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE SPIRIT FOR OBEDIENCE TO JESUS CHRIST AND FOR SPRINKLING WITH HIS BLOODMAY GRACE AND PEACE BE MULTIPLIED TO YOU

BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

ACCORDING TO HIS GREAT MERCY HE HAS CAUSED US TO BE BORN AGAIN TO A LIVING HOPE THROUGH THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST FROM THE DEAD TO AN INHERITANCE THAT IS IMPERISHABLE UNDEFILED AND UNFADING KEPT IN HEAVEN FOR YOU WHO BY GOD'S POWER ARE BEING GUARDED THROUGH FAITH FOR A SALVATION READY TO BE REVEALED IN THE LAST TIME

IN THIS YOU REJOICE THOUGH NOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE IF NECESSARY YOU HAVE BEEN GRIEVED BY VARIOUS TRIALS SO THAT THE TESTED GENUINENESS OF YOUR FAITHMORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD THAT PERISHES THOUGH IT IS TESTED BY FIREMAY BE FOUND TO RESULT IN PRAISE AND GLORY AND HONOR AT THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST

THOUGH YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM YOU LOVE HIM

THOUGH YOU DO NOT NOW SEE HIM YOU BELIEVE IN HIM AND REJOICE WITH JOY THAT IS INEXPRESSIBLE AND FILLED WITH GLORY OBTAINING THE OUTCOME OF YOUR FAITH THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOULS

CONCERNING THIS SALVATION THE PROPHETS WHO PROPHESIED ABOUT THE GRACE THAT WAS TO BE YOURS SEARCHED AND INQUIRED CAREFULLY INQUIRING WHAT PERSON OR TIME THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN THEM WAS INDICATING WHEN HE PREDICTED THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST AND THE SUBSEQUENT GLORIES

IT WAS REVEALED TO THEM THAT THEY WERE SERVING NOT THEMSELVES BUT YOU IN THE THINGS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN ANNOUNCED TO YOU THROUGH THOSE WHO PREACHED THE GOOD NEWS TO YOU BY THE HOLY SPIRIT SENT FROM HEAVEN THINGS INTO WHICH ANGELS LONG TO LOOK

THEREFORE PREPARING YOUR MINDS FOR ACTION AND BEING SOBERMINDED SET YOUR HOPE FULLY ON THE GRACE THAT WILL BE BROUGHT TO YOU AT THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST

AS OBEDIENT CHILDREN DO NOT BE CONFORMED TO THE PASSIONS OF YOUR FORMER IGNORANCE BUT AS HE WHO CALLED YOU IS HOLY YOU ALSO BE HOLY IN ALL YOUR CONDUCT SINCE IT IS WRITTEN YOU SHALL BE HOLY FOR I AM HOLY

 AND IF YOU CALL ON HIM AS FATHER WHO JUDGES IMPARTIALLY ACCORDING TO EACH ONE'S DEEDS CONDUCT YOURSELVES WITH FEAR THROUGHOUT THE TIME OF YOUR EXILE KNOWING THAT YOU WERE RANSOMED FROM THE FUTILE WAYS INHERITED FROM YOUR FOREFATHERS NOT WITH PERISHABLE THINGS SUCH AS SILVER OR GOLD BUT WITH THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST LIKE THAT OF A LAMB WITHOUT BLEMISH OR SPOT

HE WAS FOREKNOWN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD BUT WAS MADE MANIFEST IN THE LAST TIMES FOR YOUR SAKE WHO THROUGH HIM ARE BELIEVERS IN GOD WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD AND GAVE HIM GLORY SO THAT YOUR FAITH AND HOPE ARE IN GOD

HAVING PURIFIED YOUR SOULS BY YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE TRUTH FOR A SINCERE BROTHERLY LOVE LOVE ONE ANOTHER EARNESTLY FROM A PURE HEART SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN BORN AGAIN NOT OF PERISHABLE SEED BUT OF IMPERISHABLE THROUGH THE LIVING AND ABIDING WORD OF GOD; FOR ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS

THE GRASS WITHERS AND THE FLOWER FALLS BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD REMAINS FOREVER

AND THIS WORD IS THE GOOD NEWS THAT WAS PREACHED TO YOU

SO PUT AWAY ALL MALICE AND ALL DECEIT AND HYPOCRISY AND ENVY AND ALL SLANDER

LIKE NEWBORN INFANTS LONG FOR THE PURE SPIRITUAL MILK THAT BY IT YOU MAY GROW UP TO SALVATION IF INDEED YOU HAVE TASTED THAT THE LORD IS GOOD

AS YOU COME TO HIM A LIVING STONE REJECTED BY MEN BUT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD CHOSEN AND PRECIOUS YOU YOURSELVES LIKE LIVING STONES ARE BEING BUILT UP AS A SPIRITUAL HOUSE TO BE A HOLY PRIESTHOOD TO OFFER SPIRITUAL SACRIFICES ACCEPTABLE TO GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST

FOR IT STANDS IN SCRIPTURE BEHOLD I AM LAYING IN ZION A STONE A CORNERSTONE CHOSEN AND PRECIOUS AND WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME

 SO THE HONOR IS FOR YOU WHO BELIEVE BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE AND A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE

THEY STUMBLE BECAUSE THEY DISOBEY THE WORD AS THEY WERE DESTINED TO DO

BUT YOU ARE A CHOSEN RACE A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD A HOLY NATION A PEOPLE FOR HIS OWN POSSESSION THAT YOU MAY PROCLAIM THE EXCELLENCIES OF HIM WHO CALLED YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT

ONCE YOU WERE NOT A PEOPLE BUT NOW YOU ARE GOD'S PEOPLE; ONCE YOU HAD NOT RECEIVED MERCY BUT NOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED MERCY

BELOVED I URGE YOU AS SOJOURNERS AND EXILES TO ABSTAIN FROM THE PASSIONS OF THE FLESH WHICH WAGE WAR AGAINST YOUR SOUL

KEEP YOUR CONDUCT AMONG THE GENTILES HONORABLE SO THAT WHEN THEY SPEAK AGAINST YOU AS EVILDOERS THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD DEEDS AND GLORIFY GOD ON THE DAY OF VISITATION

BE SUBJECT FOR THE LORD'S SAKE TO EVERY HUMAN INSTITUTION WHETHER IT BE TO THE EMPEROR AS SUPREME OR TO GOVERNORS AS SENT BY HIM TO PUNISH THOSE WHO DO EVIL AND TO PRAISE THOSE WHO DO GOOD

FOR THIS IS THE WILL OF GOD THAT BY DOING GOOD YOU SHOULD PUT TO SILENCE THE IGNORANCE OF FOOLISH PEOPLE

LIVE AS PEOPLE WHO ARE FREE NOT USING YOUR FREEDOM AS A COVERUP FOR EVIL BUT LIVING AS SERVANTS OF GOD

HONOR EVERYONE

LOVE THE BROTHERHOOD

FEAR GOD

HONOR THE EMPEROR

SERVANTS BE SUBJECT TO YOUR MASTERS WITH ALL RESPECT NOT ONLY TO THE GOOD AND GENTLE BUT ALSO TO THE UNJUST

FOR THIS IS A GRACIOUS THING WHEN MINDFUL OF GOD ONE ENDURES SORROWS WHILE SUFFERING UNJUSTLY

FOR WHAT CREDIT IS IT IF WHEN YOU SIN AND ARE BEATEN FOR IT YOU ENDURE

BUT IF WHEN YOU DO GOOD AND SUFFER FOR IT YOU ENDURE THIS IS A GRACIOUS THING IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

FOR TO THIS YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED BECAUSE CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR YOU LEAVING YOU AN EXAMPLE SO THAT YOU MIGHT FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS

HE COMMITTED NO SIN NEITHER WAS DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH

WHEN HE WAS REVILED HE DID NOT REVILE IN RETURN; WHEN HE SUFFERED HE DID NOT THREATEN BUT CONTINUED ENTRUSTING HIMSELF TO HIM WHO JUDGES JUSTLY

HE HIMSELF BORE OUR SINS IN HIS BODY ON THE TREE THAT WE MIGHT DIE TO SIN AND LIVE TO RIGHTEOUSNESS

BY HIS WOUNDS YOU HAVE BEEN HEALED

FOR YOU WERE STRAYING LIKE SHEEP BUT HAVE NOW RETURNED TO THE SHEPHERD AND OVERSEER OF YOUR SOULS

LIKEWISE WIVES BE SUBJECT TO YOUR OWN HUSBANDS SO THAT EVEN IF SOME DO NOT OBEY THE WORD THEY MAY BE WON WITHOUT A WORD BY THE CONDUCT OF THEIR WIVES WHEN THEY SEE YOUR RESPECTFUL AND PURE CONDUCT

DO NOT LET YOUR ADORNING BE EXTERNALTHE BRAIDING OF HAIR THE WEARING OF GOLD OR THE PUTTING ON OF CLOTHING BUT LET YOUR ADORNING BE THE HIDDEN PERSON OF THE HEART WITH THE IMPERISHABLE BEAUTY OF A GENTLE AND QUIET SPIRIT WHICH IN GOD'S SIGHT IS VERY PRECIOUS

FOR THIS IS HOW THE HOLY WOMEN WHO HOPED IN GOD USED TO ADORN THEMSELVES BY SUBMITTING TO THEIR HUSBANDS AS SARAH OBEYED ABRAHAM CALLING HIM LORD

AND YOU ARE HER CHILDREN IF YOU DO GOOD AND DO NOT FEAR ANYTHING THAT IS FRIGHTENING

LIKEWISE HUSBANDS LIVE WITH YOUR WIVES IN AN UNDERSTANDING WAY SHOWING HONOR TO THE WOMAN AS THE WEAKER VESSEL SINCE THEY ARE HEIRS WITH YOU OF THE GRACE OF LIFE SO THAT YOUR PRAYERS MAY NOT BE HINDERED

FINALLY ALL OF YOU HAVE UNITY OF MIND SYMPATHY BROTHERLY LOVE A TENDER HEART AND A HUMBLE MIND

DO NOT REPAY EVIL FOR EVIL OR REVILING FOR REVILING BUT ON THE CONTRARY BLESS FOR TO THIS YOU WERE CALLED THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN A BLESSING

FOR WHOEVER DESIRES TO LOVE LIFE AND SEE GOOD DAYS LET HIM KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT; LET HIM TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; LET HIM SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT

FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE ON THE RIGHTEOUS AND HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THEIR PRAYER

BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL

 NOW WHO IS THERE TO HARM YOU IF YOU ARE ZEALOUS FOR WHAT IS GOOD

BUT EVEN IF YOU SHOULD SUFFER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE YOU WILL BE BLESSED

HAVE NO FEAR OF THEM NOR BE TROUBLED BUT IN YOUR HEARTS REGARD CHRIST THE LORD AS HOLY ALWAYS BEING PREPARED TO MAKE A DEFENSE TO ANYONE WHO ASKS YOU FOR A REASON FOR THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU; YET DO IT WITH GENTLENESS AND RESPECT HAVING A GOOD CONSCIENCE SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE SLANDERED THOSE WHO REVILE YOUR GOOD BEHAVIOR IN CHRIST MAY BE PUT TO SHAME

FOR IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER FOR DOING GOOD IF THAT SHOULD BE GOD'S WILL THAN FOR DOING EVIL

FOR CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED ONCE FOR SINS THE RIGHTEOUS FOR THE UNRIGHTEOUS THAT HE MIGHT BRING US TO GOD BEING PUT TO DEATH IN THE FLESH BUT MADE ALIVE IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH HE WENT AND PROCLAIMED TO THE SPIRITS IN PRISON BECAUSE THEY FORMERLY DID NOT OBEY WHEN GOD'S PATIENCE WAITED IN THE DAYS OF NOAH WHILE THE ARK WAS BEING PREPARED IN WHICH A FEW THAT IS EIGHT PERSONS WERE BROUGHT SAFELY THROUGH WATER

BAPTISM WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THIS NOW SAVES YOU NOT AS A REMOVAL OF DIRT FROM THE BODY BUT AS AN APPEAL TO GOD FOR A GOOD CONSCIENCE THROUGH THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST WHO HAS GONE INTO HEAVEN AND IS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD WITH ANGELS AUTHORITIES AND POWERS HAVING BEEN SUBJECTED TO HIM

SINCE THEREFORE CHRIST SUFFERED IN THE FLESH ARM YOURSELVES WITH THE SAME WAY OF THINKING FOR WHOEVER HAS SUFFERED IN THE FLESH HAS CEASED FROM SIN SO AS TO LIVE FOR THE REST OF THE TIME IN THE FLESH NO LONGER FOR HUMAN PASSIONS BUT FOR THE WILL OF GOD

THE TIME THAT IS PAST SUFFICES FOR DOING WHAT THE GENTILES WANT TO DO LIVING IN SENSUALITY PASSIONS DRUNKENNESS ORGIES DRINKING PARTIES AND LAWLESS IDOLATRY

WITH RESPECT TO THIS THEY ARE SURPRISED WHEN YOU DO NOT JOIN THEM IN THE SAME FLOOD OF DEBAUCHERY AND THEY MALIGN YOU; BUT THEY WILL GIVE ACCOUNT TO HIM WHO IS READY TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD

FOR THIS IS WHY THE GOSPEL WAS PREACHED EVEN TO THOSE WHO ARE DEAD THAT THOUGH JUDGED IN THE FLESH THE WAY PEOPLE ARE THEY MIGHT LIVE IN THE SPIRIT THE WAY GOD DOES

THE END OF ALL THINGS IS AT HAND; THEREFORE BE SELFCONTROLLED AND SOBERMINDED FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRAYERS

ABOVE ALL KEEP LOVING ONE ANOTHER EARNESTLY SINCE LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS

SHOW HOSPITALITY TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT GRUMBLING

AS EACH HAS RECEIVED A GIFT USE IT TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER AS GOOD STEWARDS OF GOD'S VARIED GRACE WHOEVER SPEAKS AS ONE WHO SPEAKS ORACLES OF GOD; WHOEVER SERVES AS ONE WHO SERVES BY THE STRENGTH THAT GOD SUPPLIESIN ORDER THAT IN EVERYTHING GOD MAY BE GLORIFIED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST

TO HIM BELONG GLORY AND DOMINION FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

BELOVED DO NOT BE SURPRISED AT THE FIERY TRIAL WHEN IT COMES UPON YOU TO TEST YOU AS THOUGH SOMETHING STRANGE WERE HAPPENING TO YOU

BUT REJOICE INSOFAR AS YOU SHARE CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS THAT YOU MAY ALSO REJOICE AND BE GLAD WHEN HIS GLORY IS REVEALED

IF YOU ARE INSULTED FOR THE NAME OF CHRIST YOU ARE BLESSED BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GLORY AND OF GOD RESTS UPON YOU

BUT LET NONE OF YOU SUFFER AS A MURDERER OR A THIEF OR AN EVILDOER OR AS A MEDDLER

YET IF ANYONE SUFFERS AS A CHRISTIAN LET HIM NOT BE ASHAMED BUT LET HIM GLORIFY GOD IN THAT NAME

FOR IT IS TIME FOR JUDGMENT TO BEGIN AT THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD; AND IF IT BEGINS WITH US WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY THE GOSPEL OF GOD

AND IF THE RIGHTEOUS IS SCARCELY SAVED WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE UNGODLY AND THE SINNER

 THEREFORE LET THOSE WHO SUFFER ACCORDING TO GOD'S WILL ENTRUST THEIR SOULS TO A FAITHFUL CREATOR WHILE DOING GOOD

SO I EXHORT THE ELDERS AMONG YOU AS A FELLOW ELDER AND A WITNESS OF THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST AS WELL AS A PARTAKER IN THE GLORY THAT IS GOING TO BE REVEALED SHEPHERD THE FLOCK OF GOD THAT IS AMONG YOU EXERCISING OVERSIGHT NOT UNDER COMPULSION BUT WILLINGLY AS GOD WOULD HAVE YOU; NOT FOR SHAMEFUL GAIN BUT EAGERLY; NOT DOMINEERING OVER THOSE IN YOUR CHARGE BUT BEING EXAMPLES TO THE FLOCK

AND WHEN THE CHIEF SHEPHERD APPEARS YOU WILL RECEIVE THE UNFADING CROWN OF GLORY

LIKEWISE YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER BE SUBJECT TO THE ELDERS

CLOTHE YOURSELVES ALL OF YOU WITH HUMILITY TOWARD ONE ANOTHER FOR GOD OPPOSES THE PROUD BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE

 HUMBLE YOURSELVES THEREFORE UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD SO THAT AT THE PROPER TIME HE MAY EXALT YOU CASTING ALL YOUR ANXIETIES ON HIM BECAUSE HE CARES FOR YOU

BE SOBERMINDED; BE WATCHFUL

YOUR ADVERSARY THE DEVIL PROWLS AROUND LIKE A ROARING LION SEEKING SOMEONE TO DEVOUR

RESIST HIM FIRM IN YOUR FAITH KNOWING THAT THE SAME KINDS OF SUFFERING ARE BEING EXPERIENCED BY YOUR BROTHERHOOD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

AND AFTER YOU HAVE SUFFERED A LITTLE WHILE THE GOD OF ALL GRACE WHO HAS CALLED YOU TO HIS ETERNAL GLORY IN CHRIST WILL HIMSELF RESTORE CONFIRM STRENGTHEN AND ESTABLISH YOU

TO HIM BE THE DOMINION FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

BY SILVANUS A FAITHFUL BROTHER AS I REGARD HIM I HAVE WRITTEN BRIEFLY TO YOU EXHORTING AND DECLARING THAT THIS IS THE TRUE GRACE OF GOD

STAND FIRM IN IT

SHE WHO IS AT BABYLON WHO IS LIKEWISE CHOSEN SENDS YOU GREETINGS AND SO DOES MARK MY SON

GREET ONE ANOTHER WITH THE KISS OF LOVE

PEACE TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE IN CHRIST

PSALMSBLESSED IS THE MAN WHO WALKS NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE WICKED NOR STANDS IN THE WAY OF SINNERS NOR SITS IN THE SEAT OF SCOFFERS; BUT HIS DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW OF THE LORD AND ON HIS LAW HE MEDITATES DAY AND NIGHT

HE IS LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY STREAMS OF WATER THAT YIELDS ITS FRUIT IN ITS SEASON AND ITS LEAF DOES NOT WITHER

IN ALL THAT HE DOES HE PROSPERS

THE WICKED ARE NOT SO BUT ARE LIKE CHAFF THAT THE WIND DRIVES AWAY

THEREFORE THE WICKED WILL NOT STAND IN THE JUDGMENT NOR SINNERS IN THE CONGREGATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS; FOR THE LORD KNOWS THE WAY OF THE RIGHTEOUS BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED WILL PERISH

WHY DO THE NATIONS RAGE AND THE PEOPLES PLOT IN VAIN

THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SET THEMSELVES AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED SAYING LET US BURST THEIR BONDS APART AND CAST AWAY THEIR CORDS FROM US

 HE WHO SITS IN THE HEAVENS LAUGHS; THE LORD HOLDS THEM IN DERISION

THEN HE WILL SPEAK TO THEM IN HIS WRATH AND TERRIFY THEM IN HIS FURY SAYING AS FOR ME I HAVE SET MY KING ON ZION MY HOLY HILL

 I WILL TELL OF THE DECREE THE LORD SAID TO ME YOU ARE MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU

ASK OF ME AND I WILL MAKE THE NATIONS YOUR HERITAGE AND THE ENDS OF THE EARTH YOUR POSSESSION

YOU SHALL BREAK THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON AND DASH THEM IN PIECES LIKE A POTTER'S VESSEL

 NOW THEREFORE O KINGS BE WISE; BE WARNED O RULERS OF THE EARTH

SERVE THE LORD WITH FEAR AND REJOICE WITH TREMBLING

KISS THE SON LEST HE BE ANGRY AND YOU PERISH IN THE WAY FOR HIS WRATH IS QUICKLY KINDLED

BLESSED ARE ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

O LORD HOW MANY ARE MY FOES

MANY ARE RISING AGAINST ME; MANY ARE SAYING OF MY SOUL THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR HIM IN GOD

SELAH BUT YOU O LORD ARE A SHIELD ABOUT ME MY GLORY AND THE LIFTER OF MY HEAD

I CRIED ALOUD TO THE LORD AND HE ANSWERED ME FROM HIS HOLY HILL

SELAH I LAY DOWN AND SLEPT; I WOKE AGAIN FOR THE LORD SUSTAINED ME

I WILL NOT BE AFRAID OF MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SET THEMSELVES AGAINST ME ALL AROUND

ARISE O LORD

SAVE ME O MY GOD

FOR YOU STRIKE ALL MY ENEMIES ON THE CHEEK; YOU BREAK THE TEETH OF THE WICKED

SALVATION BELONGS TO THE LORD; YOUR BLESSING BE ON YOUR PEOPLE

SELAHANSWER ME WHEN I CALL O GOD OF MY RIGHTEOUSNESS

YOU HAVE GIVEN ME RELIEF WHEN I WAS IN DISTRESS

BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND HEAR MY PRAYER

O MEN HOW LONG SHALL MY HONOR BE TURNED INTO SHAME

HOW LONG WILL YOU LOVE VAIN WORDS AND SEEK AFTER LIES

SELAH BUT KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SET APART THE GODLY FOR HIMSELF; THE LORD HEARS WHEN I CALL TO HIM

BE ANGRY AND DO NOT SIN; PONDER IN YOUR OWN HEARTS ON YOUR BEDS AND BE SILENT

SELAH OFFER RIGHT SACRIFICES AND PUT YOUR TRUST IN THE LORD

THERE ARE MANY WHO SAY WHO WILL SHOW US SOME GOOD

LIFT UP THE LIGHT OF YOUR FACE UPON US O LORD

 YOU HAVE PUT MORE JOY IN MY HEART THAN THEY HAVE WHEN THEIR GRAIN AND WINE ABOUND

IN PEACE I WILL BOTH LIE DOWN AND SLEEP; FOR YOU ALONE O LORD MAKE ME DWELL IN SAFETY

GIVE EAR TO MY WORDS O LORD; CONSIDER MY GROANING

GIVE ATTENTION TO THE SOUND OF MY CRY MY KING AND MY GOD FOR TO YOU DO I PRAY

O LORD IN THE MORNING YOU HEAR MY VOICE; IN THE MORNING I PREPARE A SACRIFICE FOR YOU AND WATCH

FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS; EVIL MAY NOT DWELL WITH YOU

THE BOASTFUL SHALL NOT STAND BEFORE YOUR EYES; YOU HATE ALL EVILDOERS

YOU DESTROY THOSE WHO SPEAK LIES; THE LORD ABHORS THE BLOODTHIRSTY AND DECEITFUL MAN

BUT I THROUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE WILL ENTER YOUR HOUSE

I WILL BOW DOWN TOWARD YOUR HOLY TEMPLE IN THE FEAR OF YOU

LEAD ME O LORD IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE OF MY ENEMIES; MAKE YOUR WAY STRAIGHT BEFORE ME

FOR THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THEIR MOUTH; THEIR INMOST SELF IS DESTRUCTION; THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE; THEY FLATTER WITH THEIR TONGUE

MAKE THEM BEAR THEIR GUILT O GOD; LET THEM FALL BY THEIR OWN COUNSELS; BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS CAST THEM OUT FOR THEY HAVE REBELLED AGAINST YOU

BUT LET ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU REJOICE; LET THEM EVER SING FOR JOY AND SPREAD YOUR PROTECTION OVER THEM THAT THOSE WHO LOVE YOUR NAME MAY EXULT IN YOU

FOR YOU BLESS THE RIGHTEOUS O LORD; YOU COVER HIM WITH FAVOR AS WITH A SHIELD

O LORD REBUKE ME NOT IN YOUR ANGER NOR DISCIPLINE ME IN YOUR WRATH

BE GRACIOUS TO ME O LORD FOR I AM LANGUISHING; HEAL ME O LORD FOR MY BONES ARE TROUBLED

MY SOUL ALSO IS GREATLY TROUBLED

BUT YOU O LORDHOW LONG

TURN O LORD DELIVER MY LIFE; SAVE ME FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE

FOR IN DEATH THERE IS NO REMEMBRANCE OF YOU; IN SHEOL WHO WILL GIVE YOU PRAISE

I AM WEARY WITH MY MOANING; EVERY NIGHT I FLOOD MY BED WITH TEARS; I DRENCH MY COUCH WITH MY WEEPING

MY EYE WASTES AWAY BECAUSE OF GRIEF; IT GROWS WEAK BECAUSE OF ALL MY FOES

DEPART FROM ME ALL YOU WORKERS OF EVIL FOR THE LORD HAS HEARD THE SOUND OF MY WEEPING

THE LORD HAS HEARD MY PLEA; THE LORD ACCEPTS MY PRAYER

ALL MY ENEMIES SHALL BE ASHAMED AND GREATLY TROUBLED; THEY SHALL TURN BACK AND BE PUT TO SHAME IN A MOMENT

O LORD MY GOD IN YOU DO I TAKE REFUGE; SAVE ME FROM ALL MY PURSUERS AND DELIVER ME LEST LIKE A LION THEY TEAR MY SOUL APART RENDING IT IN PIECES WITH NONE TO DELIVER

O LORD MY GOD IF I HAVE DONE THIS IF THERE IS WRONG IN MY HANDS IF I HAVE REPAID MY FRIEND WITH EVIL OR PLUNDERED MY ENEMY WITHOUT CAUSE LET THE ENEMY PURSUE MY SOUL AND OVERTAKE IT AND LET HIM TRAMPLE MY LIFE TO THE GROUND AND LAY MY GLORY IN THE DUST

SELAH ARISE O LORD IN YOUR ANGER; LIFT YOURSELF UP AGAINST THE FURY OF MY ENEMIES; AWAKE FOR ME; YOU HAVE APPOINTED A JUDGMENT

LET THE ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLES BE GATHERED ABOUT YOU; OVER IT RETURN ON HIGH

THE LORD JUDGES THE PEOPLES; JUDGE ME O LORD ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ACCORDING TO THE INTEGRITY THAT IS IN ME

OH LET THE EVIL OF THE WICKED COME TO AN END AND MAY YOU ESTABLISH THE RIGHTEOUSYOU WHO TEST THE MINDS AND HEARTS O RIGHTEOUS GOD

MY SHIELD IS WITH GOD WHO SAVES THE UPRIGHT IN HEART

GOD IS A RIGHTEOUS JUDGE AND A GOD WHO FEELS INDIGNATION EVERY DAY

IF A MAN DOES NOT REPENT GOD WILL WHET HIS SWORD; HE HAS BENT AND READIED HIS BOW; HE HAS PREPARED FOR HIM HIS DEADLY WEAPONS MAKING HIS ARROWS FIERY SHAFTS

BEHOLD THE WICKED MAN CONCEIVES EVIL AND IS PREGNANT WITH MISCHIEF AND GIVES BIRTH TO LIES

HE MAKES A PIT DIGGING IT OUT AND FALLS INTO THE HOLE THAT HE HAS MADE

HIS MISCHIEF RETURNS UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND ON HIS OWN SKULL HIS VIOLENCE DESCENDS

I WILL GIVE TO THE LORD THE THANKS DUE TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND I WILL SING PRAISE TO THE NAME OF THE LORD THE MOST HIGH

O LORD OUR LORD HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME IN ALL THE EARTH

YOU HAVE SET YOUR GLORY ABOVE THE HEAVENS

OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND INFANTS YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED STRENGTH BECAUSE OF YOUR FOES TO STILL THE ENEMY AND THE AVENGER

WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR HEAVENS THE WORK OF YOUR FINGERS THE MOON AND THE STARS WHICH YOU HAVE SET IN PLACE WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM AND THE SON OF MAN THAT YOU CARE FOR HIM

YET YOU HAVE MADE HIM A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE HEAVENLY BEINGS AND CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR

YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM DOMINION OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS; YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET ALL SHEEP AND OXEN AND ALSO THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE FISH OF THE SEA WHATEVER PASSES ALONG THE PATHS OF THE SEAS

O LORD OUR LORD HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME IN ALL THE EARTH

I WILL GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD WITH MY WHOLE HEART; I WILL RECOUNT ALL OF YOUR WONDERFUL DEEDS

I WILL BE GLAD AND EXULT IN YOU; I WILL SING PRAISE TO YOUR NAME O MOST HIGH

WHEN MY ENEMIES TURN BACK THEY STUMBLE AND PERISH BEFORE YOUR PRESENCE

FOR YOU HAVE MAINTAINED MY JUST CAUSE; YOU HAVE SAT ON THE THRONE GIVING RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT

YOU HAVE REBUKED THE NATIONS; YOU HAVE MADE THE WICKED PERISH; YOU HAVE BLOTTED OUT THEIR NAME FOREVER AND EVER

THE ENEMY CAME TO AN END IN EVERLASTING RUINS; THEIR CITIES YOU ROOTED OUT; THE VERY MEMORY OF THEM HAS PERISHED

BUT THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED FOREVER; HE HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE FOR JUSTICE AND HE JUDGES THE WORLD WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS; HE JUDGES THE PEOPLES WITH UPRIGHTNESS

THE LORD IS A STRONGHOLD FOR THE OPPRESSED A STRONGHOLD IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

AND THOSE WHO KNOW YOUR NAME PUT THEIR TRUST IN YOU FOR YOU O LORD HAVE NOT FORSAKEN THOSE WHO SEEK YOU

SING PRAISES TO THE LORD WHO SITS ENTHRONED IN ZION

TELL AMONG THE PEOPLES HIS DEEDS

FOR HE WHO AVENGES BLOOD IS MINDFUL OF THEM; HE DOES NOT FORGET THE CRY OF THE AFFLICTED

BE GRACIOUS TO ME O LORD

SEE MY AFFLICTION FROM THOSE WHO HATE ME O YOU WHO LIFT ME UP FROM THE GATES OF DEATH THAT I MAY RECOUNT ALL YOUR PRAISES THAT IN THE GATES OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION I MAY REJOICE IN YOUR SALVATION

THE NATIONS HAVE SUNK IN THE PIT THAT THEY MADE; IN THE NET THAT THEY HID THEIR OWN FOOT HAS BEEN CAUGHT

THE LORD HAS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN; HE HAS EXECUTED JUDGMENT; THE WICKED ARE SNARED IN THE WORK OF THEIR OWN HANDS

HIGGAION

SELAH THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO SHEOL ALL THE NATIONS THAT FORGET GOD

FOR THE NEEDY SHALL NOT ALWAYS BE FORGOTTEN AND THE HOPE OF THE POOR SHALL NOT PERISH FOREVER

ARISE O LORD

LET NOT MAN PREVAIL; LET THE NATIONS BE JUDGED BEFORE YOU

PUT THEM IN FEAR O LORD

LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY ARE BUT MEN

SELAHWHY O LORD DO YOU STAND AFAR OFF

WHY DO YOU HIDE YOURSELF IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

IN ARROGANCE THE WICKED HOTLY PURSUE THE POOR; LET THEM BE CAUGHT IN THE SCHEMES THAT THEY HAVE DEVISED

FOR THE WICKED BOASTS OF THE DESIRES OF HIS SOUL AND THE ONE GREEDY FOR GAIN CURSES AND RENOUNCES THE LORD

IN THE PRIDE OF HIS FACE THE WICKED DOES NOT SEEK HIM; ALL HIS THOUGHTS ARE THERE IS NO GOD

 HIS WAYS PROSPER AT ALL TIMES; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE ON HIGH OUT OF HIS SIGHT; AS FOR ALL HIS FOES HE PUFFS AT THEM

HE SAYS IN HIS HEART I SHALL NOT BE MOVED; THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS I SHALL NOT MEET ADVERSITY

 HIS MOUTH IS FILLED WITH CURSING AND DECEIT AND OPPRESSION; UNDER HIS TONGUE ARE MISCHIEF AND INIQUITY

HE SITS IN AMBUSH IN THE VILLAGES; IN HIDING PLACES HE MURDERS THE INNOCENT

HIS EYES STEALTHILY WATCH FOR THE HELPLESS; HE LURKS IN AMBUSH LIKE A LION IN HIS THICKET; HE LURKS THAT HE MAY SEIZE THE POOR; HE SEIZES THE POOR WHEN HE DRAWS HIM INTO HIS NET

THE HELPLESS ARE CRUSHED SINK DOWN AND FALL BY HIS MIGHT

HE SAYS IN HIS HEART GOD HAS FORGOTTEN HE HAS HIDDEN HIS FACE HE WILL NEVER SEE IT

 ARISE O LORD; O GOD LIFT UP YOUR HAND; FORGET NOT THE AFFLICTED

WHY DOES THE WICKED RENOUNCE GOD AND SAY IN HIS HEART YOU WILL NOT CALL TO ACCOUNT

BUT YOU DO SEE FOR YOU NOTE MISCHIEF AND VEXATION THAT YOU MAY TAKE IT INTO YOUR HANDS; TO YOU THE HELPLESS COMMITS HIMSELF; YOU HAVE BEEN THE HELPER OF THE FATHERLESS

BREAK THE ARM OF THE WICKED AND EVILDOER; CALL HIS WICKEDNESS TO ACCOUNT TILL YOU FIND NONE

THE LORD IS KING FOREVER AND EVER; THE NATIONS PERISH FROM HIS LAND

O LORD YOU HEAR THE DESIRE OF THE AFFLICTED; YOU WILL STRENGTHEN THEIR HEART; YOU WILL INCLINE YOUR EAR TO DO JUSTICE TO THE FATHERLESS AND THE OPPRESSED SO THAT MAN WHO IS OF THE EARTH MAY STRIKE TERROR NO MORE

IN THE LORD I TAKE REFUGE; HOW CAN YOU SAY TO MY SOUL FLEE LIKE A BIRD TO YOUR MOUNTAIN FOR BEHOLD THE WICKED BEND THE BOW; THEY HAVE FITTED THEIR ARROW TO THE STRING TO SHOOT IN THE DARK AT THE UPRIGHT IN HEART; IF THE FOUNDATIONS ARE DESTROYED WHAT CAN THE RIGHTEOUS DO

 THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE; THE LORD'S THRONE IS IN HEAVEN; HIS EYES SEE HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF MAN

THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS BUT HIS SOUL HATES THE WICKED AND THE ONE WHO LOVES VIOLENCE

LET HIM RAIN COALS ON THE WICKED; FIRE AND SULFUR AND A SCORCHING WIND SHALL BE THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP

FOR THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS; HE LOVES RIGHTEOUS DEEDS; THE UPRIGHT SHALL BEHOLD HIS FACE

SAVE O LORD FOR THE GODLY ONE IS GONE; FOR THE FAITHFUL HAVE VANISHED FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF MAN

EVERYONE UTTERS LIES TO HIS NEIGHBOR; WITH FLATTERING LIPS AND A DOUBLE HEART THEY SPEAK

MAY THE LORD CUT OFF ALL FLATTERING LIPS THE TONGUE THAT MAKES GREAT BOASTS THOSE WHO SAY WITH OUR TONGUE WE WILL PREVAIL OUR LIPS ARE WITH US; WHO IS MASTER OVER US

 BECAUSE THE POOR ARE PLUNDERED BECAUSE THE NEEDY GROAN I WILL NOW ARISE SAYS THE LORD; I WILL PLACE HIM IN THE SAFETY FOR WHICH HE LONGS

 THE WORDS OF THE LORD ARE PURE WORDS LIKE SILVER REFINED IN A FURNACE ON THE GROUND PURIFIED SEVEN TIMES

YOU O LORD WILL KEEP THEM; YOU WILL GUARD US FROM THIS GENERATION FOREVER

ON EVERY SIDE THE WICKED PROWL AS VILENESS IS EXALTED AMONG THE CHILDREN OF MAN

HOW LONG O LORD

WILL YOU FORGET ME FOREVER

HOW LONG WILL YOU HIDE YOUR FACE FROM ME

HOW LONG MUST I TAKE COUNSEL IN MY SOUL AND HAVE SORROW IN MY HEART ALL THE DAY

HOW LONG SHALL MY ENEMY BE EXALTED OVER ME

CONSIDER AND ANSWER ME O LORD MY GOD; LIGHT UP MY EYES LEST I SLEEP THE SLEEP OF DEATH LEST MY ENEMY SAY I HAVE PREVAILED OVER HIM LEST MY FOES REJOICE BECAUSE I AM SHAKEN

BUT I HAVE TRUSTED IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE; MY HEART SHALL REJOICE IN YOUR SALVATION

I WILL SING TO THE LORD BECAUSE HE HAS DEALT BOUNTIFULLY WITH ME

THE FOOL SAYS IN HIS HEART THERE IS NO GOD

 THEY ARE CORRUPT THEY DO ABOMINABLE DEEDS THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD

THE LORD LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE CHILDREN OF MAN TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY WHO UNDERSTAND WHO SEEK AFTER GOD

THEY HAVE ALL TURNED ASIDE; TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME CORRUPT; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD NOT EVEN ONE

HAVE THEY NO KNOWLEDGE ALL THE EVILDOERS WHO EAT UP MY PEOPLE AS THEY EAT BREAD AND DO NOT CALL UPON THE LORD

THERE THEY ARE IN GREAT TERROR FOR GOD IS WITH THE GENERATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS

YOU WOULD SHAME THE PLANS OF THE POOR BUT THE LORD IS HIS REFUGE

OH THAT SALVATION FOR ISRAEL WOULD COME OUT OF ZION

WHEN THE LORD RESTORES THE FORTUNES OF HIS PEOPLE LET JACOB REJOICE LET ISRAEL BE GLAD

O LORD WHO SHALL SOJOURN IN YOUR TENT

WHO SHALL DWELL ON YOUR HOLY HILL

HE WHO WALKS BLAMELESSLY AND DOES WHAT IS RIGHT AND SPEAKS TRUTH IN HIS HEART; WHO DOES NOT SLANDER WITH HIS TONGUE AND DOES NO EVIL TO HIS NEIGHBOR NOR TAKES UP A REPROACH AGAINST HIS FRIEND; IN WHOSE EYES A VILE PERSON IS DESPISED BUT WHO HONORS THOSE WHO FEAR THE LORD; WHO SWEARS TO HIS OWN HURT AND DOES NOT CHANGE; WHO DOES NOT PUT OUT HIS MONEY AT INTEREST AND DOES NOT TAKE A BRIBE AGAINST THE INNOCENT

HE WHO DOES THESE THINGS SHALL NEVER BE MOVED

PRESERVE ME O GOD FOR IN YOU I TAKE REFUGE

I SAY TO THE LORD YOU ARE MY LORD; I HAVE NO GOOD APART FROM YOU

 AS FOR THE SAINTS IN THE LAND THEY ARE THE EXCELLENT ONES IN WHOM IS ALL MY DELIGHT

THE SORROWS OF THOSE WHO RUN AFTER ANOTHER GOD SHALL MULTIPLY; THEIR DRINK OFFERINGS OF BLOOD I WILL NOT POUR OUT OR TAKE THEIR NAMES ON MY LIPS

THE LORD IS MY CHOSEN PORTION AND MY CUP; YOU HOLD MY LOT

THE LINES HAVE FALLEN FOR ME IN PLEASANT PLACES; INDEED I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL INHERITANCE

I BLESS THE LORD WHO GIVES ME COUNSEL; IN THE NIGHT ALSO MY HEART INSTRUCTS ME

I HAVE SET THE LORD ALWAYS BEFORE ME; BECAUSE HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND I SHALL NOT BE SHAKEN

THEREFORE MY HEART IS GLAD AND MY WHOLE BEING REJOICES; MY FLESH ALSO DWELLS SECURE

FOR YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO SHEOL OR LET YOUR HOLY ONE SEE CORRUPTION

YOU MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE PATH OF LIFE; IN YOUR PRESENCE THERE IS FULLNESS OF JOY; AT YOUR RIGHT HAND ARE PLEASURES FOREVERMORE

HEAR A JUST CAUSE O LORD; ATTEND TO MY CRY

GIVE EAR TO MY PRAYER FROM LIPS FREE OF DECEIT

FROM YOUR PRESENCE LET MY VINDICATION COME

LET YOUR EYES BEHOLD THE RIGHT

YOU HAVE TRIED MY HEART YOU HAVE VISITED ME BY NIGHT YOU HAVE TESTED ME AND YOU WILL FIND NOTHING; I HAVE PURPOSED THAT MY MOUTH WILL NOT TRANSGRESS

WITH REGARD TO THE WORKS OF MAN BY THE WORD OF YOUR LIPS I HAVE AVOIDED THE WAYS OF THE VIOLENT

MY STEPS HAVE HELD FAST TO YOUR PATHS; MY FEET HAVE NOT SLIPPED

I CALL UPON YOU FOR YOU WILL ANSWER ME O GOD; INCLINE YOUR EAR TO ME; HEAR MY WORDS

WONDROUSLY SHOW YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O SAVIOR OF THOSE WHO SEEK REFUGE FROM THEIR ADVERSARIES AT YOUR RIGHT HAND

KEEP ME AS THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE; HIDE ME IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS FROM THE WICKED WHO DO ME VIOLENCE MY DEADLY ENEMIES WHO SURROUND ME

THEY CLOSE THEIR HEARTS TO PITY; WITH THEIR MOUTHS THEY SPEAK ARROGANTLY

THEY HAVE NOW SURROUNDED OUR STEPS; THEY SET THEIR EYES TO CAST US TO THE GROUND

HE IS LIKE A LION EAGER TO TEAR AS A YOUNG LION LURKING IN AMBUSH

ARISE O LORD

CONFRONT HIM SUBDUE HIM

DELIVER MY SOUL FROM THE WICKED BY YOUR SWORD FROM MEN BY YOUR HAND O LORD FROM MEN OF THE WORLD WHOSE PORTION IS IN THIS LIFE

YOU FILL THEIR WOMB WITH TREASURE; THEY ARE SATISFIED WITH CHILDREN AND THEY LEAVE THEIR ABUNDANCE TO THEIR INFANTS

AS FOR ME I SHALL BEHOLD YOUR FACE IN RIGHTEOUSNESS; WHEN I AWAKE I SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH YOUR LIKENESS

I LOVE YOU O LORD MY STRENGTH

THE LORD IS MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS AND MY DELIVERER MY GOD MY ROCK IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE MY SHIELD AND THE HORN OF MY SALVATION MY STRONGHOLD

I CALL UPON THE LORD WHO IS WORTHY TO BE PRAISED AND I AM SAVED FROM MY ENEMIES

THE CORDS OF DEATH ENCOMPASSED ME; THE TORRENTS OF DESTRUCTION ASSAILED ME; THE CORDS OF SHEOL ENTANGLED ME; THE SNARES OF DEATH CONFRONTED ME

IN MY DISTRESS I CALLED UPON THE LORD; TO MY GOD I CRIED FOR HELP

FROM HIS TEMPLE HE HEARD MY VOICE AND MY CRY TO HIM REACHED HIS EARS

THEN THE EARTH REELED AND ROCKED; THE FOUNDATIONS ALSO OF THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLED AND QUAKED BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY

SMOKE WENT UP FROM HIS NOSTRILS AND DEVOURING FIRE FROM HIS MOUTH; GLOWING COALS FLAMED FORTH FROM HIM

HE BOWED THE HEAVENS AND CAME DOWN; THICK DARKNESS WAS UNDER HIS FEET

HE RODE ON A CHERUB AND FLEW; HE CAME SWIFTLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND

HE MADE DARKNESS HIS COVERING HIS CANOPY AROUND HIM THICK CLOUDS DARK WITH WATER

OUT OF THE BRIGHTNESS BEFORE HIM HAILSTONES AND COALS OF FIRE BROKE THROUGH HIS CLOUDS

THE LORD ALSO THUNDERED IN THE HEAVENS AND THE MOST HIGH UTTERED HIS VOICE HAILSTONES AND COALS OF FIRE

AND HE SENT OUT HIS ARROWS AND SCATTERED THEM; HE FLASHED FORTH LIGHTNINGS AND ROUTED THEM

THEN THE CHANNELS OF THE SEA WERE SEEN AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD WERE LAID BARE AT YOUR REBUKE O LORD AT THE BLAST OF THE BREATH OF YOUR NOSTRILS

HE SENT FROM ON HIGH HE TOOK ME; HE DREW ME OUT OF MANY WATERS

HE RESCUED ME FROM MY STRONG ENEMY AND FROM THOSE WHO HATED ME FOR THEY WERE TOO MIGHTY FOR ME

THEY CONFRONTED ME IN THE DAY OF MY CALAMITY BUT THE LORD WAS MY SUPPORT

HE BROUGHT ME OUT INTO A BROAD PLACE; HE RESCUED ME BECAUSE HE DELIGHTED IN ME

THE LORD DEALT WITH ME ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS; ACCORDING TO THE CLEANNESS OF MY HANDS HE REWARDED ME

FOR I HAVE KEPT THE WAYS OF THE LORD AND HAVE NOT WICKEDLY DEPARTED FROM MY GOD

FOR ALL HIS RULES WERE BEFORE ME AND HIS STATUTES I DID NOT PUT AWAY FROM ME

I WAS BLAMELESS BEFORE HIM AND I KEPT MYSELF FROM MY GUILT

SO THE LORD HAS REWARDED ME ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS ACCORDING TO THE CLEANNESS OF MY HANDS IN HIS SIGHT

WITH THE MERCIFUL YOU SHOW YOURSELF MERCIFUL; WITH THE BLAMELESS MAN YOU SHOW YOURSELF BLAMELESS; WITH THE PURIFIED YOU SHOW YOURSELF PURE; AND WITH THE CROOKED YOU MAKE YOURSELF SEEM TORTUOUS

FOR YOU SAVE A HUMBLE PEOPLE BUT THE HAUGHTY EYES YOU BRING DOWN

FOR IT IS YOU WHO LIGHT MY LAMP; THE LORD MY GOD LIGHTENS MY DARKNESS

FOR BY YOU I CAN RUN AGAINST A TROOP AND BY MY GOD I CAN LEAP OVER A WALL

THIS GODHIS WAY IS PERFECT; THE WORD OF THE LORD PROVES TRUE; HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

FOR WHO IS GOD BUT THE LORD

AND WHO IS A ROCK EXCEPT OUR GOD

 THE GOD WHO EQUIPPED ME WITH STRENGTH AND MADE MY WAY BLAMELESS

HE MADE MY FEET LIKE THE FEET OF A DEER AND SET ME SECURE ON THE HEIGHTS

HE TRAINS MY HANDS FOR WAR SO THAT MY ARMS CAN BEND A BOW OF BRONZE

YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE SHIELD OF YOUR SALVATION AND YOUR RIGHT HAND SUPPORTED ME AND YOUR GENTLENESS MADE ME GREAT

YOU GAVE A WIDE PLACE FOR MY STEPS UNDER ME AND MY FEET DID NOT SLIP

I PURSUED MY ENEMIES AND OVERTOOK THEM AND DID NOT TURN BACK TILL THEY WERE CONSUMED

I THRUST THEM THROUGH SO THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO RISE; THEY FELL UNDER MY FEET

FOR YOU EQUIPPED ME WITH STRENGTH FOR THE BATTLE; YOU MADE THOSE WHO RISE AGAINST ME SINK UNDER ME

YOU MADE MY ENEMIES TURN THEIR BACKS TO ME AND THOSE WHO HATED ME I DESTROYED

THEY CRIED FOR HELP BUT THERE WAS NONE TO SAVE; THEY CRIED TO THE LORD BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THEM

I BEAT THEM FINE AS DUST BEFORE THE WIND; I CAST THEM OUT LIKE THE MIRE OF THE STREETS

YOU DELIVERED ME FROM STRIFE WITH THE PEOPLE; YOU MADE ME THE HEAD OF THE NATIONS; PEOPLE WHOM I HAD NOT KNOWN SERVED ME

AS SOON AS THEY HEARD OF ME THEY OBEYED ME; FOREIGNERS CAME CRINGING TO ME

FOREIGNERS LOST HEART AND CAME TREMBLING OUT OF THEIR FORTRESSES

THE LORD LIVES AND BLESSED BE MY ROCK AND EXALTED BE THE GOD OF MY SALVATION THE GOD WHO GAVE ME VENGEANCE AND SUBDUED PEOPLES UNDER ME WHO DELIVERED ME FROM MY ENEMIES; YES YOU EXALTED ME ABOVE THOSE WHO ROSE AGAINST ME; YOU RESCUED ME FROM THE MAN OF VIOLENCE

FOR THIS I WILL PRAISE YOU O LORD AMONG THE NATIONS AND SING TO YOUR NAME

GREAT SALVATION HE BRINGS TO HIS KING AND SHOWS STEADFAST LOVE TO HIS ANOINTED TO DAVID AND HIS OFFSPRING FOREVER

THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE SKY ABOVE PROCLAIMS HIS HANDIWORK

DAY TO DAY POURS OUT SPEECH AND NIGHT TO NIGHT REVEALS KNOWLEDGE

THERE IS NO SPEECH NOR ARE THERE WORDS WHOSE VOICE IS NOT HEARD

THEIR MEASURING LINE GOES OUT THROUGH ALL THE EARTH AND THEIR WORDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD

IN THEM HE HAS SET A TENT FOR THE SUN WHICH COMES OUT LIKE A BRIDEGROOM LEAVING HIS CHAMBER AND LIKE A STRONG MAN RUNS ITS COURSE WITH JOY

ITS RISING IS FROM THE END OF THE HEAVENS AND ITS CIRCUIT TO THE END OF THEM AND THERE IS NOTHING HIDDEN FROM ITS HEAT

THE LAW OF THE LORD IS PERFECT REVIVING THE SOUL; THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD IS SURE MAKING WISE THE SIMPLE; THE PRECEPTS OF THE LORD ARE RIGHT REJOICING THE HEART; THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD IS PURE ENLIGHTENING THE EYES; THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS CLEAN ENDURING FOREVER; THE RULES OF THE LORD ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS ALTOGETHER

MORE TO BE DESIRED ARE THEY THAN GOLD EVEN MUCH FINE GOLD; SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND DRIPPINGS OF THE HONEYCOMB

MOREOVER BY THEM IS YOUR SERVANT WARNED; IN KEEPING THEM THERE IS GREAT REWARD

WHO CAN DISCERN HIS ERRORS

DECLARE ME INNOCENT FROM HIDDEN FAULTS

KEEP BACK YOUR SERVANT ALSO FROM PRESUMPTUOUS SINS; LET THEM NOT HAVE DOMINION OVER ME

THEN I SHALL BE BLAMELESS AND INNOCENT OF GREAT TRANSGRESSION

LET THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH AND THE MEDITATION OF MY HEART BE ACCEPTABLE IN YOUR SIGHT O LORD MY ROCK AND MY REDEEMER

MAY THE LORD ANSWER YOU IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE

MAY THE NAME OF THE GOD OF JACOB PROTECT YOU

MAY HE SEND YOU HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY AND GIVE YOU SUPPORT FROM ZION

MAY HE REMEMBER ALL YOUR OFFERINGS AND REGARD WITH FAVOR YOUR BURNT SACRIFICES

SELAH MAY HE GRANT YOU YOUR HEART'S DESIRE AND FULFILL ALL YOUR PLANS

MAY WE SHOUT FOR JOY OVER YOUR SALVATION AND IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD SET UP OUR BANNERS

MAY THE LORD FULFILL ALL YOUR PETITIONS

NOW I KNOW THAT THE LORD SAVES HIS ANOINTED; HE WILL ANSWER HIM FROM HIS HOLY HEAVEN WITH THE SAVING MIGHT OF HIS RIGHT HAND

SOME TRUST IN CHARIOTS AND SOME IN HORSES BUT WE TRUST IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OUR GOD

THEY COLLAPSE AND FALL BUT WE RISE AND STAND UPRIGHT

O LORD SAVE THE KING

MAY HE ANSWER US WHEN WE CALL

O LORD IN YOUR STRENGTH THE KING REJOICES AND IN YOUR SALVATION HOW GREATLY HE EXULTS

YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM HIS HEART'S DESIRE AND HAVE NOT WITHHELD THE REQUEST OF HIS LIPS

SELAH FOR YOU MEET HIM WITH RICH BLESSINGS; YOU SET A CROWN OF FINE GOLD UPON HIS HEAD

HE ASKED LIFE OF YOU; YOU GAVE IT TO HIM LENGTH OF DAYS FOREVER AND EVER

HIS GLORY IS GREAT THROUGH YOUR SALVATION; SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY YOU BESTOW ON HIM

FOR YOU MAKE HIM MOST BLESSED FOREVER; YOU MAKE HIM GLAD WITH THE JOY OF YOUR PRESENCE

FOR THE KING TRUSTS IN THE LORD AND THROUGH THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE MOST HIGH HE SHALL NOT BE MOVED

YOUR HAND WILL FIND OUT ALL YOUR ENEMIES; YOUR RIGHT HAND WILL FIND OUT THOSE WHO HATE YOU

YOU WILL MAKE THEM AS A BLAZING OVEN WHEN YOU APPEAR

THE LORD WILL SWALLOW THEM UP IN HIS WRATH AND FIRE WILL CONSUME THEM

YOU WILL DESTROY THEIR DESCENDANTS FROM THE EARTH AND THEIR OFFSPRING FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF MAN

THOUGH THEY PLAN EVIL AGAINST YOU THOUGH THEY DEVISE MISCHIEF THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED

FOR YOU WILL PUT THEM TO FLIGHT; YOU WILL AIM AT THEIR FACES WITH YOUR BOWS

BE EXALTED O LORD IN YOUR STRENGTH

WE WILL SING AND PRAISE YOUR POWER

MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME

WHY ARE YOU SO FAR FROM SAVING ME FROM THE WORDS OF MY GROANING

O MY GOD I CRY BY DAY BUT YOU DO NOT ANSWER AND BY NIGHT BUT I FIND NO REST

YET YOU ARE HOLY ENTHRONED ON THE PRAISES OF ISRAEL

IN YOU OUR FATHERS TRUSTED; THEY TRUSTED AND YOU DELIVERED THEM

TO YOU THEY CRIED AND WERE RESCUED; IN YOU THEY TRUSTED AND WERE NOT PUT TO SHAME

BUT I AM A WORM AND NOT A MAN SCORNED BY MANKIND AND DESPISED BY THE PEOPLE

ALL WHO SEE ME MOCK ME; THEY MAKE MOUTHS AT ME; THEY WAG THEIR HEADS; HE TRUSTS IN THE LORD; LET HIM DELIVER HIM; LET HIM RESCUE HIM FOR HE DELIGHTS IN HIM

 YET YOU ARE HE WHO TOOK ME FROM THE WOMB; YOU MADE ME TRUST YOU AT MY MOTHER'S BREASTS

ON YOU WAS I CAST FROM MY BIRTH AND FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB YOU HAVE BEEN MY GOD

BE NOT FAR FROM ME FOR TROUBLE IS NEAR AND THERE IS NONE TO HELP

MANY BULLS ENCOMPASS ME; STRONG BULLS OF BASHAN SURROUND ME; THEY OPEN WIDE THEIR MOUTHS AT ME LIKE A RAVENING AND ROARING LION

I AM POURED OUT LIKE WATER AND ALL MY BONES ARE OUT OF JOINT; MY HEART IS LIKE WAX; IT IS MELTED WITHIN MY BREAST; MY STRENGTH IS DRIED UP LIKE A POTSHERD AND MY TONGUE STICKS TO MY JAWS; YOU LAY ME IN THE DUST OF DEATH

FOR DOGS ENCOMPASS ME; A COMPANY OF EVILDOERS ENCIRCLES ME; THEY HAVE PIERCED MY HANDS AND FEET I CAN COUNT ALL MY BONESTHEY STARE AND GLOAT OVER ME; THEY DIVIDE MY GARMENTS AMONG THEM AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS

BUT YOU O LORD DO NOT BE FAR OFF

O YOU MY HELP COME QUICKLY TO MY AID

DELIVER MY SOUL FROM THE SWORD MY PRECIOUS LIFE FROM THE POWER OF THE DOG

SAVE ME FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LION

YOU HAVE RESCUED ME FROM THE HORNS OF THE WILD OXEN

I WILL TELL OF YOUR NAME TO MY BROTHERS; IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL PRAISE YOU YOU WHO FEAR THE LORD PRAISE HIM

ALL YOU OFFSPRING OF JACOB GLORIFY HIM AND STAND IN AWE OF HIM ALL YOU OFFSPRING OF ISRAEL

FOR HE HAS NOT DESPISED OR ABHORRED THE AFFLICTION OF THE AFFLICTED AND HE HAS NOT HIDDEN HIS FACE FROM HIM BUT HAS HEARD WHEN HE CRIED TO HIM

FROM YOU COMES MY PRAISE IN THE GREAT CONGREGATION; MY VOWS I WILL PERFORM BEFORE THOSE WHO FEAR HIM

THE AFFLICTED SHALL EAT AND BE SATISFIED; THOSE WHO SEEK HIM SHALL PRAISE THE LORD

MAY YOUR HEARTS LIVE FOREVER

ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH SHALL REMEMBER AND TURN TO THE LORD AND ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE NATIONS SHALL WORSHIP BEFORE YOU

FOR KINGSHIP BELONGS TO THE LORD AND HE RULES OVER THE NATIONS

ALL THE PROSPEROUS OF THE EARTH EAT AND WORSHIP; BEFORE HIM SHALL BOW ALL WHO GO DOWN TO THE DUST EVEN THE ONE WHO COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF ALIVE

POSTERITY SHALL SERVE HIM; IT SHALL BE TOLD OF THE LORD TO THE COMING GENERATION; THEY SHALL COME AND PROCLAIM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO A PEOPLE YET UNBORN THAT HE HAS DONE IT

THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD; I SHALL NOT WANT

HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES

HE LEADS ME BESIDE STILL WATERS

HE RESTORES MY SOUL

HE LEADS ME IN PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE

EVEN THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR YOU ARE WITH ME; YOUR ROD AND YOUR STAFF THEY COMFORT ME

YOU PREPARE A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES; YOU ANOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP OVERFLOWS

SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE AND I SHALL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER

THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S AND THE FULLNESS THEREOF THE WORLD AND THOSE WHO DWELL THEREIN FOR HE HAS FOUNDED IT UPON THE SEAS AND ESTABLISHED IT UPON THE RIVERS

WHO SHALL ASCEND THE HILL OF THE LORD

AND WHO SHALL STAND IN HIS HOLY PLACE

HE WHO HAS CLEAN HANDS AND A PURE HEART WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS SOUL TO WHAT IS FALSE AND DOES NOT SWEAR DECEITFULLY

HE WILL RECEIVE BLESSING FROM THE LORD AND RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE GOD OF HIS SALVATION

SUCH IS THE GENERATION OF THOSE WHO SEEK HIM WHO SEEK THE FACE OF THE GOD OF JACOB

SELAH LIFT UP YOUR HEADS O GATES

AND BE LIFTED UP O ANCIENT DOORS THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN

WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY

THE LORD STRONG AND MIGHTY THE LORD MIGHTY IN BATTLE

LIFT UP YOUR HEADS O GATES

AND LIFT THEM UP O ANCIENT DOORS THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN

WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY

THE LORD OF HOSTS HE IS THE KING OF GLORY

SELAHTO YOU O LORD I LIFT UP MY SOUL

O MY GOD IN YOU I TRUST; LET ME NOT BE PUT TO SHAME; LET NOT MY ENEMIES EXULT OVER ME

INDEED NONE WHO WAIT FOR YOU SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME; THEY SHALL BE ASHAMED WHO ARE WANTONLY TREACHEROUS

MAKE ME TO KNOW YOUR WAYS O LORD; TEACH ME YOUR PATHS

LEAD ME IN YOUR TRUTH AND TEACH ME FOR YOU ARE THE GOD OF MY SALVATION; FOR YOU I WAIT ALL THE DAY LONG

REMEMBER YOUR MERCY O LORD AND YOUR STEADFAST LOVE FOR THEY HAVE BEEN FROM OF OLD

REMEMBER NOT THE SINS OF MY YOUTH OR MY TRANSGRESSIONS; ACCORDING TO YOUR STEADFAST LOVE REMEMBER ME FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR GOODNESS O LORD

GOOD AND UPRIGHT IS THE LORD; THEREFORE HE INSTRUCTS SINNERS IN THE WAY

HE LEADS THE HUMBLE IN WHAT IS RIGHT AND TEACHES THE HUMBLE HIS WAY

ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS FOR THOSE WHO KEEP HIS COVENANT AND HIS TESTIMONIES

FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE O LORD PARDON MY GUILT FOR IT IS GREAT

WHO IS THE MAN WHO FEARS THE LORD

HIM WILL HE INSTRUCT IN THE WAY THAT HE SHOULD CHOOSE

HIS SOUL SHALL ABIDE IN WELLBEING AND HIS OFFSPRING SHALL INHERIT THE LAND

THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM AND HE MAKES KNOWN TO THEM HIS COVENANT

MY EYES ARE EVER TOWARD THE LORD FOR HE WILL PLUCK MY FEET OUT OF THE NET

TURN TO ME AND BE GRACIOUS TO ME FOR I AM LONELY AND AFFLICTED

THE TROUBLES OF MY HEART ARE ENLARGED; BRING ME OUT OF MY DISTRESSES

CONSIDER MY AFFLICTION AND MY TROUBLE AND FORGIVE ALL MY SINS

CONSIDER HOW MANY ARE MY FOES AND WITH WHAT VIOLENT HATRED THEY HATE ME

OH GUARD MY SOUL AND DELIVER ME

LET ME NOT BE PUT TO SHAME FOR I TAKE REFUGE IN YOU

MAY INTEGRITY AND UPRIGHTNESS PRESERVE ME FOR I WAIT FOR YOU

REDEEM ISRAEL O GOD OUT OF ALL HIS TROUBLES

VINDICATE ME O LORD FOR I HAVE WALKED IN MY INTEGRITY AND I HAVE TRUSTED IN THE LORD WITHOUT WAVERING

PROVE ME O LORD AND TRY ME; TEST MY HEART AND MY MIND

FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS BEFORE MY EYES AND I WALK IN YOUR FAITHFULNESS

I DO NOT SIT WITH MEN OF FALSEHOOD NOR DO I CONSORT WITH HYPOCRITES

I HATE THE ASSEMBLY OF EVILDOERS AND I WILL NOT SIT WITH THE WICKED

I WASH MY HANDS IN INNOCENCE AND GO AROUND YOUR ALTAR O LORD PROCLAIMING THANKSGIVING ALOUD AND TELLING ALL YOUR WONDROUS DEEDS

O LORD I LOVE THE HABITATION OF YOUR HOUSE AND THE PLACE WHERE YOUR GLORY DWELLS

DO NOT SWEEP MY SOUL AWAY WITH SINNERS NOR MY LIFE WITH BLOODTHIRSTY MEN IN WHOSE HANDS ARE EVIL DEVICES AND WHOSE RIGHT HANDS ARE FULL OF BRIBES

BUT AS FOR ME I SHALL WALK IN MY INTEGRITY; REDEEM ME AND BE GRACIOUS TO ME

MY FOOT STANDS ON LEVEL GROUND; IN THE GREAT ASSEMBLY I WILL BLESS THE LORD

THE LORD IS MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION; WHOM SHALL I FEAR

THE LORD IS THE STRONGHOLD OF MY LIFE; OF WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID

WHEN EVILDOERS ASSAIL ME TO EAT UP MY FLESH MY ADVERSARIES AND FOES IT IS THEY WHO STUMBLE AND FALL

THOUGH AN ARMY ENCAMP AGAINST ME MY HEART SHALL NOT FEAR; THOUGH WAR ARISE AGAINST ME YET I WILL BE CONFIDENT

ONE THING HAVE I ASKED OF THE LORD THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE TO GAZE UPON THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE

FOR HE WILL HIDE ME IN HIS SHELTER IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE WILL CONCEAL ME UNDER THE COVER OF HIS TENT; HE WILL LIFT ME HIGH UPON A ROCK

AND NOW MY HEAD SHALL BE LIFTED UP ABOVE MY ENEMIES ALL AROUND ME AND I WILL OFFER IN HIS TENT SACRIFICES WITH SHOUTS OF JOY; I WILL SING AND MAKE MELODY TO THE LORD

HEAR O LORD WHEN I CRY ALOUD; BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND ANSWER ME

YOU HAVE SAID SEEK MY FACE

 MY HEART SAYS TO YOU YOUR FACE LORD DO I SEEK

 HIDE NOT YOUR FACE FROM ME

TURN NOT YOUR SERVANT AWAY IN ANGER O YOU WHO HAVE BEEN MY HELP

CAST ME NOT OFF; FORSAKE ME NOT O GOD OF MY SALVATION

FOR MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER HAVE FORSAKEN ME BUT THE LORD WILL TAKE ME IN

TEACH ME YOUR WAY O LORD AND LEAD ME ON A LEVEL PATH BECAUSE OF MY ENEMIES

GIVE ME NOT UP TO THE WILL OF MY ADVERSARIES; FOR FALSE WITNESSES HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME AND THEY BREATHE OUT VIOLENCE

I BELIEVE THAT I SHALL LOOK UPON THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING

WAIT FOR THE LORD; BE STRONG AND LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE; WAIT FOR THE LORD

TO YOU O LORD I CALL; MY ROCK BE NOT DEAF TO ME LEST IF YOU BE SILENT TO ME I BECOME LIKE THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT

HEAR THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY WHEN I CRY TO YOU FOR HELP WHEN I LIFT UP MY HANDS TOWARD YOUR MOST HOLY SANCTUARY

DO NOT DRAG ME OFF WITH THE WICKED WITH THE WORKERS OF EVIL WHO SPEAK PEACE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS WHILE EVIL IS IN THEIR HEARTS

GIVE TO THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR WORK AND ACCORDING TO THE EVIL OF THEIR DEEDS; GIVE TO THEM ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS; RENDER THEM THEIR DUE REWARD

BECAUSE THEY DO NOT REGARD THE WORKS OF THE LORD OR THE WORK OF HIS HANDS HE WILL TEAR THEM DOWN AND BUILD THEM UP NO MORE

BLESSED BE THE LORD

FOR HE HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY

THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND MY SHIELD; IN HIM MY HEART TRUSTS AND I AM HELPED; MY HEART EXULTS AND WITH MY SONG I GIVE THANKS TO HIM

THE LORD IS THE STRENGTH OF HIS PEOPLE; HE IS THE SAVING REFUGE OF HIS ANOINTED

OH SAVE YOUR PEOPLE AND BLESS YOUR HERITAGE

BE THEIR SHEPHERD AND CARRY THEM FOREVER

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD O HEAVENLY BEINGS ASCRIBE TO THE LORD GLORY AND STRENGTH

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD THE GLORY DUE HIS NAME; WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE SPLENDOR OF HOLINESS

THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS OVER THE WATERS; THE GOD OF GLORY THUNDERS THE LORD OVER MANY WATERS

THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS POWERFUL; THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS FULL OF MAJESTY

THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS THE CEDARS; THE LORD BREAKS THE CEDARS OF LEBANON

HE MAKES LEBANON TO SKIP LIKE A CALF AND SIRION LIKE A YOUNG WILD OX

THE VOICE OF THE LORD FLASHES FORTH FLAMES OF FIRE

THE VOICE OF THE LORD SHAKES THE WILDERNESS; THE LORD SHAKES THE WILDERNESS OF KADESH

THE VOICE OF THE LORD MAKES THE DEER GIVE BIRTH AND STRIPS THE FORESTS BARE AND IN HIS TEMPLE ALL CRY GLORY

 THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED OVER THE FLOOD; THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED AS KING FOREVER

MAY THE LORD GIVE STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE

MAY THE LORD BLESS HIS PEOPLE WITH PEACE

I WILL EXTOL YOU O LORD FOR YOU HAVE DRAWN ME UP AND HAVE NOT LET MY FOES REJOICE OVER ME

O LORD MY GOD I CRIED TO YOU FOR HELP AND YOU HAVE HEALED ME

O LORD YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP MY SOUL FROM SHEOL; YOU RESTORED ME TO LIFE FROM AMONG THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT

SING PRAISES TO THE LORD O YOU HIS SAINTS AND GIVE THANKS TO HIS HOLY NAME

FOR HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A LIFETIME

WEEPING MAY TARRY FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMES WITH THE MORNING

AS FOR ME I SAID IN MY PROSPERITY I SHALL NEVER BE MOVED

 BY YOUR FAVOR O LORD YOU MADE MY MOUNTAIN STAND STRONG; YOU HID YOUR FACE; I WAS DISMAYED

TO YOU O LORD I CRY AND TO THE LORD I PLEAD FOR MERCY WHAT PROFIT IS THERE IN MY DEATH IF I GO DOWN TO THE PIT

WILL THE DUST PRAISE YOU

WILL IT TELL OF YOUR FAITHFULNESS

HEAR O LORD AND BE MERCIFUL TO ME

O LORD BE MY HELPER

 YOU HAVE TURNED FOR ME MY MOURNING INTO DANCING; YOU HAVE LOOSED MY SACKCLOTH AND CLOTHED ME WITH GLADNESS THAT MY GLORY MAY SING YOUR PRAISE AND NOT BE SILENT

O LORD MY GOD I WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU FOREVER

IN YOU O LORD DO I TAKE REFUGE; LET ME NEVER BE PUT TO SHAME; IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS DELIVER ME

INCLINE YOUR EAR TO ME; RESCUE ME SPEEDILY

BE A ROCK OF REFUGE FOR ME A STRONG FORTRESS TO SAVE ME

FOR YOU ARE MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS; AND FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE YOU LEAD ME AND GUIDE ME; YOU TAKE ME OUT OF THE NET THEY HAVE HIDDEN FOR ME FOR YOU ARE MY REFUGE

INTO YOUR HAND I COMMIT MY SPIRIT; YOU HAVE REDEEMED ME O LORD FAITHFUL GOD

I HATE THOSE WHO PAY REGARD TO WORTHLESS IDOLS BUT I TRUST IN THE LORD

I WILL REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN MY AFFLICTION; YOU HAVE KNOWN THE DISTRESS OF MY SOUL AND YOU HAVE NOT DELIVERED ME INTO THE HAND OF THE ENEMY; YOU HAVE SET MY FEET IN A BROAD PLACE

BE GRACIOUS TO ME O LORD FOR I AM IN DISTRESS; MY EYE IS WASTED FROM GRIEF; MY SOUL AND MY BODY ALSO

FOR MY LIFE IS SPENT WITH SORROW AND MY YEARS WITH SIGHING; MY STRENGTH FAILS BECAUSE OF MY INIQUITY AND MY BONES WASTE AWAY

BECAUSE OF ALL MY ADVERSARIES I HAVE BECOME A REPROACH ESPECIALLY TO MY NEIGHBORS AND AN OBJECT OF DREAD TO MY ACQUAINTANCES; THOSE WHO SEE ME IN THE STREET FLEE FROM ME

I HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN LIKE ONE WHO IS DEAD; I HAVE BECOME LIKE A BROKEN VESSEL

FOR I HEAR THE WHISPERING OF MANYTERROR ON EVERY SIDE

AS THEY SCHEME TOGETHER AGAINST ME AS THEY PLOT TO TAKE MY LIFE

BUT I TRUST IN YOU O LORD; I SAY YOU ARE MY GOD

 MY TIMES ARE IN YOUR HAND; RESCUE ME FROM THE HAND OF MY ENEMIES AND FROM MY PERSECUTORS

MAKE YOUR FACE SHINE ON YOUR SERVANT; SAVE ME IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE

O LORD LET ME NOT BE PUT TO SHAME FOR I CALL UPON YOU; LET THE WICKED BE PUT TO SHAME; LET THEM GO SILENTLY TO SHEOL

LET THE LYING LIPS BE MUTE WHICH SPEAK INSOLENTLY AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS IN PRIDE AND CONTEMPT

OH HOW ABUNDANT IS YOUR GOODNESS WHICH YOU HAVE STORED UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU AND WORKED FOR THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU IN THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND

IN THE COVER OF YOUR PRESENCE YOU HIDE THEM FROM THE PLOTS OF MEN; YOU STORE THEM IN YOUR SHELTER FROM THE STRIFE OF TONGUES

BLESSED BE THE LORD FOR HE HAS WONDROUSLY SHOWN HIS STEADFAST LOVE TO ME WHEN I WAS IN A BESIEGED CITY

I HAD SAID IN MY ALARM I AM CUT OFF FROM YOUR SIGHT

 BUT YOU HEARD THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY WHEN I CRIED TO YOU FOR HELP

LOVE THE LORD ALL YOU HIS SAINTS

THE LORD PRESERVES THE FAITHFUL BUT ABUNDANTLY REPAYS THE ONE WHO ACTS IN PRIDE

BE STRONG AND LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE ALL YOU WHO WAIT FOR THE LORD

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOSE TRANSGRESSION IS FORGIVEN WHOSE SIN IS COVERED

BLESSED IS THE MAN AGAINST WHOM THE LORD COUNTS NO INIQUITY AND IN WHOSE SPIRIT THERE IS NO DECEIT

FOR WHEN I KEPT SILENT MY BONES WASTED AWAY THROUGH MY GROANING ALL DAY LONG

FOR DAY AND NIGHT YOUR HAND WAS HEAVY UPON ME; MY STRENGTH WAS DRIED UP AS BY THE HEAT OF SUMMER

SELAH I ACKNOWLEDGED MY SIN TO YOU AND I DID NOT COVER MY INIQUITY; I SAID I WILL CONFESS MY TRANSGRESSIONS TO THE LORD AND YOU FORGAVE THE INIQUITY OF MY SIN

SELAH THEREFORE LET EVERYONE WHO IS GODLY OFFER PRAYER TO YOU AT A TIME WHEN YOU MAY BE FOUND; SURELY IN THE RUSH OF GREAT WATERS THEY SHALL NOT REACH HIM

YOU ARE A HIDING PLACE FOR ME; YOU PRESERVE ME FROM TROUBLE; YOU SURROUND ME WITH SHOUTS OF DELIVERANCE

SELAH I WILL INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU IN THE WAY YOU SHOULD GO; I WILL COUNSEL YOU WITH MY EYE UPON YOU

BE NOT LIKE A HORSE OR A MULE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHICH MUST BE CURBED WITH BIT AND BRIDLE OR IT WILL NOT STAY NEAR YOU

MANY ARE THE SORROWS OF THE WICKED BUT STEADFAST LOVE SURROUNDS THE ONE WHO TRUSTS IN THE LORD

BE GLAD IN THE LORD AND REJOICE O RIGHTEOUS AND SHOUT FOR JOY ALL YOU UPRIGHT IN HEART

SHOUT FOR JOY IN THE LORD O YOU RIGHTEOUS

PRAISE BEFITS THE UPRIGHT

GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD WITH THE LYRE; MAKE MELODY TO HIM WITH THE HARP OF TEN STRINGS

SING TO HIM A NEW SONG; PLAY SKILLFULLY ON THE STRINGS WITH LOUD SHOUTS

FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD IS UPRIGHT AND ALL HIS WORK IS DONE IN FAITHFULNESS

HE LOVES RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE; THE EARTH IS FULL OF THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD

BY THE WORD OF THE LORD THE HEAVENS WERE MADE AND BY THE BREATH OF HIS MOUTH ALL THEIR HOST

HE GATHERS THE WATERS OF THE SEA AS A HEAP; HE PUTS THE DEEPS IN STOREHOUSES

LET ALL THE EARTH FEAR THE LORD; LET ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD STAND IN AWE OF HIM

FOR HE SPOKE AND IT CAME TO BE; HE COMMANDED AND IT STOOD FIRM

THE LORD BRINGS THE COUNSEL OF THE NATIONS TO NOTHING; HE FRUSTRATES THE PLANS OF THE PEOPLES

THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD STANDS FOREVER THE PLANS OF HIS HEART TO ALL GENERATIONS

BLESSED IS THE NATION WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN AS HIS HERITAGE

THE LORD LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN; HE SEES ALL THE CHILDREN OF MAN; FROM WHERE HE SITS ENTHRONED HE LOOKS OUT ON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH HE WHO FASHIONS THE HEARTS OF THEM ALL AND OBSERVES ALL THEIR DEEDS

THE KING IS NOT SAVED BY HIS GREAT ARMY; A WARRIOR IS NOT DELIVERED BY HIS GREAT STRENGTH

THE WAR HORSE IS A FALSE HOPE FOR SALVATION AND BY ITS GREAT MIGHT IT CANNOT RESCUE

BEHOLD THE EYE OF THE LORD IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM ON THOSE WHO HOPE IN HIS STEADFAST LOVE THAT HE MAY DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH AND KEEP THEM ALIVE IN FAMINE

OUR SOUL WAITS FOR THE LORD; HE IS OUR HELP AND OUR SHIELD

FOR OUR HEART IS GLAD IN HIM BECAUSE WE TRUST IN HIS HOLY NAME

LET YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O LORD BE UPON US EVEN AS WE HOPE IN YOU

I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES; HIS PRAISE SHALL CONTINUALLY BE IN MY MOUTH

MY SOUL MAKES ITS BOAST IN THE LORD; LET THE HUMBLE HEAR AND BE GLAD

OH MAGNIFY THE LORD WITH ME AND LET US EXALT HIS NAME TOGETHER

I SOUGHT THE LORD AND HE ANSWERED ME AND DELIVERED ME FROM ALL MY FEARS

THOSE WHO LOOK TO HIM ARE RADIANT AND THEIR FACES SHALL NEVER BE ASHAMED

THIS POOR MAN CRIED AND THE LORD HEARD HIM AND SAVED HIM OUT OF ALL HIS TROUBLES

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD ENCAMPS AROUND THOSE WHO FEAR HIM AND DELIVERS THEM

OH TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO TAKES REFUGE IN HIM

OH FEAR THE LORD YOU HIS SAINTS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM HAVE NO LACK

THE YOUNG LIONS SUFFER WANT AND HUNGER; BUT THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD LACK NO GOOD THING

COME O CHILDREN LISTEN TO ME; I WILL TEACH YOU THE FEAR OF THE LORD

WHAT MAN IS THERE WHO DESIRES LIFE AND LOVES MANY DAYS THAT HE MAY SEE GOOD

KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT

TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT

THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS AND HIS EARS TOWARD THEIR CRY

THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL TO CUT OFF THE MEMORY OF THEM FROM THE EARTH

WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS CRY FOR HELP THE LORD HEARS AND DELIVERS THEM OUT OF ALL THEIR TROUBLES

THE LORD IS NEAR TO THE BROKENHEARTED AND SAVES THE CRUSHED IN SPIRIT

MANY ARE THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE RIGHTEOUS BUT THE LORD DELIVERS HIM OUT OF THEM ALL

HE KEEPS ALL HIS BONES; NOT ONE OF THEM IS BROKEN

AFFLICTION WILL SLAY THE WICKED AND THOSE WHO HATE THE RIGHTEOUS WILL BE CONDEMNED

THE LORD REDEEMS THE LIFE OF HIS SERVANTS; NONE OF THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM WILL BE CONDEMNED

CONTEND O LORD WITH THOSE WHO CONTEND WITH ME; FIGHT AGAINST THOSE WHO FIGHT AGAINST ME

TAKE HOLD OF SHIELD AND BUCKLER AND RISE FOR MY HELP

DRAW THE SPEAR AND JAVELIN AGAINST MY PURSUERS

SAY TO MY SOUL I AM YOUR SALVATION

 LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISHONOR WHO SEEK AFTER MY LIFE

LET THEM BE TURNED BACK AND DISAPPOINTED WHO DEVISE EVIL AGAINST ME

LET THEM BE LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DRIVING THEM AWAY

LET THEIR WAY BE DARK AND SLIPPERY WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PURSUING THEM

FOR WITHOUT CAUSE THEY HID THEIR NET FOR ME; WITHOUT CAUSE THEY DUG A PIT FOR MY LIFE

LET DESTRUCTION COME UPON HIM WHEN HE DOES NOT KNOW IT

AND LET THE NET THAT HE HID ENSNARE HIM; LET HIM FALL INTO ITTO HIS DESTRUCTION

THEN MY SOUL WILL REJOICE IN THE LORD EXULTING IN HIS SALVATION

ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY O LORD WHO IS LIKE YOU DELIVERING THE POOR FROM HIM WHO IS TOO STRONG FOR HIM THE POOR AND NEEDY FROM HIM WHO ROBS HIM

 MALICIOUS WITNESSES RISE UP; THEY ASK ME OF THINGS THAT I DO NOT KNOW

THEY REPAY ME EVIL FOR GOOD; MY SOUL IS BEREFT

BUT I WHEN THEY WERE SICKI WORE SACKCLOTH; I AFFLICTED MYSELF WITH FASTING; I PRAYED WITH HEAD BOWED ON MY CHEST

I WENT ABOUT AS THOUGH I GRIEVED FOR MY FRIEND OR MY BROTHER; AS ONE WHO LAMENTS HIS MOTHER I BOWED DOWN IN MOURNING

BUT AT MY STUMBLING THEY REJOICED AND GATHERED; THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST ME; WRETCHES WHOM I DID NOT KNOW TORE AT ME WITHOUT CEASING; LIKE PROFANE MOCKERS AT A FEAST THEY GNASH AT ME WITH THEIR TEETH

HOW LONG O LORD WILL YOU LOOK ON

RESCUE ME FROM THEIR DESTRUCTION MY PRECIOUS LIFE FROM THE LIONS

I WILL THANK YOU IN THE GREAT CONGREGATION; IN THE MIGHTY THRONG I WILL PRAISE YOU

LET NOT THOSE REJOICE OVER ME WHO ARE WRONGFULLY MY FOES AND LET NOT THOSE WINK THE EYE WHO HATE ME WITHOUT CAUSE

FOR THEY DO NOT SPEAK PEACE BUT AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE QUIET IN THE LAND THEY DEVISE WORDS OF DECEIT

THEY OPEN WIDE THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST ME; THEY SAY AHA AHA

OUR EYES HAVE SEEN IT

 YOU HAVE SEEN O LORD; BE NOT SILENT

O LORD BE NOT FAR FROM ME

AWAKE AND ROUSE YOURSELF FOR MY VINDICATION FOR MY CAUSE MY GOD AND MY LORD

VINDICATE ME O LORD MY GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LET THEM NOT REJOICE OVER ME

LET THEM NOT SAY IN THEIR HEARTS AHA OUR HEART'S DESIRE

 LET THEM NOT SAY WE HAVE SWALLOWED HIM UP

 LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISAPPOINTED ALTOGETHER WHO REJOICE AT MY CALAMITY

LET THEM BE CLOTHED WITH SHAME AND DISHONOR WHO MAGNIFY THEMSELVES AGAINST ME

LET THOSE WHO DELIGHT IN MY RIGHTEOUSNESS SHOUT FOR JOY AND BE GLAD AND SAY EVERMORE GREAT IS THE LORD WHO DELIGHTS IN THE WELFARE OF HIS SERVANT

 THEN MY TONGUE SHALL TELL OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OF YOUR PRAISE ALL THE DAY LONG

TRANSGRESSION SPEAKS TO THE WICKED DEEP IN HIS HEART; THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES

FOR HE FLATTERS HIMSELF IN HIS OWN EYES THAT HIS INIQUITY CANNOT BE FOUND OUT AND HATED

THE WORDS OF HIS MOUTH ARE TROUBLE AND DECEIT; HE HAS CEASED TO ACT WISELY AND DO GOOD

HE PLOTS TROUBLE WHILE ON HIS BED; HE SETS HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT IS NOT GOOD; HE DOES NOT REJECT EVIL

YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O LORD EXTENDS TO THE HEAVENS YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO THE CLOUDS

YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MOUNTAINS OF GOD; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP; MAN AND BEAST YOU SAVE O LORD

HOW PRECIOUS IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O GOD

THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND TAKE REFUGE IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS

THEY FEAST ON THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR HOUSE AND YOU GIVE THEM DRINK FROM THE RIVER OF YOUR DELIGHTS

FOR WITH YOU IS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE; IN YOUR LIGHT DO WE SEE LIGHT

OH CONTINUE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE TO THOSE WHO KNOW YOU AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE UPRIGHT OF HEART

LET NOT THE FOOT OF ARROGANCE COME UPON ME NOR THE HAND OF THE WICKED DRIVE ME AWAY

THERE THE EVILDOERS LIE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN UNABLE TO RISE

FRET NOT YOURSELF BECAUSE OF EVILDOERS; BE NOT ENVIOUS OF WRONGDOERS

FOR THEY WILL SOON FADE LIKE THE GRASS AND WITHER LIKE THE GREEN HERB

TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD; DWELL IN THE LAND AND BEFRIEND FAITHFULNESS

DELIGHT YOURSELF IN THE LORD AND HE WILL GIVE YOU THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART

COMMIT YOUR WAY TO THE LORD; TRUST IN HIM AND HE WILL ACT

HE WILL BRING FORTH YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AS THE LIGHT AND YOUR JUSTICE AS THE NOONDAY

BE STILL BEFORE THE LORD AND WAIT PATIENTLY FOR HIM; FRET NOT YOURSELF OVER THE ONE WHO PROSPERS IN HIS WAY OVER THE MAN WHO CARRIES OUT EVIL DEVICES

REFRAIN FROM ANGER AND FORSAKE WRATH

FRET NOT YOURSELF; IT TENDS ONLY TO EVIL

FOR THE EVILDOERS SHALL BE CUT OFF BUT THOSE WHO WAIT FOR THE LORD SHALL INHERIT THE LAND

IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE THE WICKED WILL BE NO MORE; THOUGH YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT HIS PLACE HE WILL NOT BE THERE

BUT THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT THE LAND AND DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN ABUNDANT PEACE

THE WICKED PLOTS AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS AND GNASHES HIS TEETH AT HIM BUT THE LORD LAUGHS AT THE WICKED FOR HE SEES THAT HIS DAY IS COMING

THE WICKED DRAW THE SWORD AND BEND THEIR BOWS TO BRING DOWN THE POOR AND NEEDY TO SLAY THOSE WHOSE WAY IS UPRIGHT; THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART AND THEIR BOWS SHALL BE BROKEN

BETTER IS THE LITTLE THAT THE RIGHTEOUS HAS THAN THE ABUNDANCE OF MANY WICKED

FOR THE ARMS OF THE WICKED SHALL BE BROKEN BUT THE LORD UPHOLDS THE RIGHTEOUS

THE LORD KNOWS THE DAYS OF THE BLAMELESS AND THEIR HERITAGE WILL REMAIN FOREVER; THEY ARE NOT PUT TO SHAME IN EVIL TIMES; IN THE DAYS OF FAMINE THEY HAVE ABUNDANCE

BUT THE WICKED WILL PERISH; THE ENEMIES OF THE LORD ARE LIKE THE GLORY OF THE PASTURES; THEY VANISHLIKE SMOKE THEY VANISH AWAY

THE WICKED BORROWS BUT DOES NOT PAY BACK BUT THE RIGHTEOUS IS GENEROUS AND GIVES; FOR THOSE BLESSED BY THE LORD SHALL INHERIT THE LAND BUT THOSE CURSED BY HIM SHALL BE CUT OFF

THE STEPS OF A MAN ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE LORD WHEN HE DELIGHTS IN HIS WAY; THOUGH HE FALL HE SHALL NOT BE CAST HEADLONG FOR THE LORD UPHOLDS HIS HAND

I HAVE BEEN YOUNG AND NOW AM OLD YET I HAVE NOT SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR HIS CHILDREN BEGGING FOR BREAD

HE IS EVER LENDING GENEROUSLY AND HIS CHILDREN BECOME A BLESSING

TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; SO SHALL YOU DWELL FOREVER

FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE; HE WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS SAINTS

THEY ARE PRESERVED FOREVER BUT THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED SHALL BE CUT OFF

THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL INHERIT THE LAND AND DWELL UPON IT FOREVER

THE MOUTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS UTTERS WISDOM AND HIS TONGUE SPEAKS JUSTICE

THE LAW OF HIS GOD IS IN HIS HEART; HIS STEPS DO NOT SLIP

THE WICKED WATCHES FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND SEEKS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

THE LORD WILL NOT ABANDON HIM TO HIS POWER OR LET HIM BE CONDEMNED WHEN HE IS BROUGHT TO TRIAL

WAIT FOR THE LORD AND KEEP HIS WAY AND HE WILL EXALT YOU TO INHERIT THE LAND; YOU WILL LOOK ON WHEN THE WICKED ARE CUT OFF

I HAVE SEEN A WICKED RUTHLESS MAN SPREADING HIMSELF LIKE A GREEN LAUREL TREE

BUT HE PASSED AWAY AND BEHOLD HE WAS NO MORE; THOUGH I SOUGHT HIM HE COULD NOT BE FOUND

MARK THE BLAMELESS AND BEHOLD THE UPRIGHT FOR THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THE MAN OF PEACE

BUT TRANSGRESSORS SHALL BE ALTOGETHER DESTROYED; THE FUTURE OF THE WICKED SHALL BE CUT OFF

THE SALVATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS FROM THE LORD; HE IS THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE

THE LORD HELPS THEM AND DELIVERS THEM; HE DELIVERS THEM FROM THE WICKED AND SAVES THEM BECAUSE THEY TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

O LORD REBUKE ME NOT IN YOUR ANGER NOR DISCIPLINE ME IN YOUR WRATH

FOR YOUR ARROWS HAVE SUNK INTO ME AND YOUR HAND HAS COME DOWN ON ME

THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS IN MY FLESH BECAUSE OF YOUR INDIGNATION; THERE IS NO HEALTH IN MY BONES BECAUSE OF MY SIN

FOR MY INIQUITIES HAVE GONE OVER MY HEAD; LIKE A HEAVY BURDEN THEY ARE TOO HEAVY FOR ME

MY WOUNDS STINK AND FESTER BECAUSE OF MY FOOLISHNESS I AM UTTERLY BOWED DOWN AND PROSTRATE; ALL THE DAY I GO ABOUT MOURNING

FOR MY SIDES ARE FILLED WITH BURNING AND THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS IN MY FLESH

I AM FEEBLE AND CRUSHED; I GROAN BECAUSE OF THE TUMULT OF MY HEART

O LORD ALL MY LONGING IS BEFORE YOU; MY SIGHING IS NOT HIDDEN FROM YOU

MY HEART THROBS; MY STRENGTH FAILS ME AND THE LIGHT OF MY EYESIT ALSO HAS GONE FROM ME

MY FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS STAND ALOOF FROM MY PLAGUE AND MY NEAREST KIN STAND FAR OFF

THOSE WHO SEEK MY LIFE LAY THEIR SNARES; THOSE WHO SEEK MY HURT SPEAK OF RUIN AND MEDITATE TREACHERY ALL DAY LONG

BUT I AM LIKE A DEAF MAN; I DO NOT HEAR LIKE A MUTE MAN WHO DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH

I HAVE BECOME LIKE A MAN WHO DOES NOT HEAR AND IN WHOSE MOUTH ARE NO REBUKES

BUT FOR YOU O LORD DO I WAIT; IT IS YOU O LORD MY GOD WHO WILL ANSWER

FOR I SAID ONLY LET THEM NOT REJOICE OVER ME WHO BOAST AGAINST ME WHEN MY FOOT SLIPS

 FOR I AM READY TO FALL AND MY PAIN IS EVER BEFORE ME

I CONFESS MY INIQUITY; I AM SORRY FOR MY SIN

BUT MY FOES ARE VIGOROUS THEY ARE MIGHTY AND MANY ARE THOSE WHO HATE ME WRONGFULLY

THOSE WHO RENDER ME EVIL FOR GOOD ACCUSE ME BECAUSE I FOLLOW AFTER GOOD

DO NOT FORSAKE ME O LORD

O MY GOD BE NOT FAR FROM ME

MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME O LORD MY SALVATION

I SAID I WILL GUARD MY WAYS THAT I MAY NOT SIN WITH MY TONGUE; I WILL GUARD MY MOUTH WITH A MUZZLE SO LONG AS THE WICKED ARE IN MY PRESENCE

 I WAS MUTE AND SILENT; I HELD MY PEACE TO NO AVAIL AND MY DISTRESS GREW WORSE

MY HEART BECAME HOT WITHIN ME

AS I MUSED THE FIRE BURNED; THEN I SPOKE WITH MY TONGUE O LORD MAKE ME KNOW MY END AND WHAT IS THE MEASURE OF MY DAYS; LET ME KNOW HOW FLEETING I AM

BEHOLD YOU HAVE MADE MY DAYS A FEW HANDBREADTHS AND MY LIFETIME IS AS NOTHING BEFORE YOU

SURELY ALL MANKIND STANDS AS A MERE BREATH

SELAH SURELY A MAN GOES ABOUT AS A SHADOW

SURELY FOR NOTHING THEY ARE IN TURMOIL; MAN HEAPS UP WEALTH AND DOES NOT KNOW WHO WILL GATHER

AND NOW O LORD FOR WHAT DO I WAIT

MY HOPE IS IN YOU

DELIVER ME FROM ALL MY TRANSGRESSIONS

DO NOT MAKE ME THE SCORN OF THE FOOL

I AM MUTE; I DO NOT OPEN MY MOUTH FOR IT IS YOU WHO HAVE DONE IT

REMOVE YOUR STROKE FROM ME; I AM SPENT BY THE HOSTILITY OF YOUR HAND

WHEN YOU DISCIPLINE A MAN WITH REBUKES FOR SIN YOU CONSUME LIKE A MOTH WHAT IS DEAR TO HIM; SURELY ALL MANKIND IS A MERE BREATH

SELAH HEAR MY PRAYER O LORD AND GIVE EAR TO MY CRY; HOLD NOT YOUR PEACE AT MY TEARS

FOR I AM A SOJOURNER WITH YOU A GUEST LIKE ALL MY FATHERS

LOOK AWAY FROM ME THAT I MAY SMILE AGAIN BEFORE I DEPART AND AM NO MORE

I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE LORD; HE INCLINED TO ME AND HEARD MY CRY

HE DREW ME UP FROM THE PIT OF DESTRUCTION OUT OF THE MIRY BOG AND SET MY FEET UPON A ROCK MAKING MY STEPS SECURE

HE PUT A NEW SONG IN MY MOUTH A SONG OF PRAISE TO OUR GOD

MANY WILL SEE AND FEAR AND PUT THEIR TRUST IN THE LORD

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO MAKES THE LORD HIS TRUST WHO DOES NOT TURN TO THE PROUD TO THOSE WHO GO ASTRAY AFTER A LIE

YOU HAVE MULTIPLIED O LORD MY GOD YOUR WONDROUS DEEDS AND YOUR THOUGHTS TOWARD US; NONE CAN COMPARE WITH YOU

I WILL PROCLAIM AND TELL OF THEM YET THEY ARE MORE THAN CAN BE TOLD

SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN OPEN EAR

BURNT OFFERING AND SIN OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT REQUIRED

THEN I SAID BEHOLD I HAVE COME; IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME I DESIRE TO DO YOUR WILL O MY GOD; YOUR LAW IS WITHIN MY HEART

 I HAVE TOLD THE GLAD NEWS OF DELIVERANCE IN THE GREAT CONGREGATION; BEHOLD I HAVE NOT RESTRAINED MY LIPS AS YOU KNOW O LORD

I HAVE NOT HIDDEN YOUR DELIVERANCE WITHIN MY HEART; I HAVE SPOKEN OF YOUR FAITHFULNESS AND YOUR SALVATION; I HAVE NOT CONCEALED YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS FROM THE GREAT CONGREGATION

AS FOR YOU O LORD YOU WILL NOT RESTRAIN YOUR MERCY FROM ME; YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS WILL EVER PRESERVE ME

FOR EVILS HAVE ENCOMPASSED ME BEYOND NUMBER; MY INIQUITIES HAVE OVERTAKEN ME AND I CANNOT SEE; THEY ARE MORE THAN THE HAIRS OF MY HEAD; MY HEART FAILS ME

BE PLEASED O LORD TO DELIVER ME

O LORD MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME

LET THOSE BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISAPPOINTED ALTOGETHER WHO SEEK TO SNATCH AWAY MY LIFE; LET THOSE BE TURNED BACK AND BROUGHT TO DISHONOR WHO DESIRE MY HURT

LET THOSE BE APPALLED BECAUSE OF THEIR SHAME WHO SAY TO ME AHA AHA

 BUT MAY ALL WHO SEEK YOU REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN YOU; MAY THOSE WHO LOVE YOUR SALVATION SAY CONTINUALLY GREAT IS THE LORD

 AS FOR ME I AM POOR AND NEEDY BUT THE LORD TAKES THOUGHT FOR ME

YOU ARE MY HELP AND MY DELIVERER; DO NOT DELAY O MY GOD

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO CONSIDERS THE POOR

IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE THE LORD DELIVERS HIM; THE LORD PROTECTS HIM AND KEEPS HIM ALIVE; HE IS CALLED BLESSED IN THE LAND; YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM UP TO THE WILL OF HIS ENEMIES

THE LORD SUSTAINS HIM ON HIS SICKBED; IN HIS ILLNESS YOU RESTORE HIM TO FULL HEALTH

AS FOR ME I SAID O LORD BE GRACIOUS TO ME; HEAL ME FOR I HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

 MY ENEMIES SAY OF ME IN MALICE WHEN WILL HE DIE AND HIS NAME PERISH

 AND WHEN ONE COMES TO SEE ME HE UTTERS EMPTY WORDS WHILE HIS HEART GATHERS INIQUITY; WHEN HE GOES OUT HE TELLS IT ABROAD

ALL WHO HATE ME WHISPER TOGETHER ABOUT ME; THEY IMAGINE THE WORST FOR ME

THEY SAY A DEADLY THING IS POURED OUT ON HIM; HE WILL NOT RISE AGAIN FROM WHERE HE LIES

 EVEN MY CLOSE FRIEND IN WHOM I TRUSTED WHO ATE MY BREAD HAS LIFTED HIS HEEL AGAINST ME

BUT YOU O LORD BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND RAISE ME UP THAT I MAY REPAY THEM

BY THIS I KNOW THAT YOU DELIGHT IN ME MY ENEMY WILL NOT SHOUT IN TRIUMPH OVER ME

BUT YOU HAVE UPHELD ME BECAUSE OF MY INTEGRITY AND SET ME IN YOUR PRESENCE FOREVER

BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING

AMEN AND AMEN

AS A DEER PANTS FOR FLOWING STREAMS SO PANTS MY SOUL FOR YOU O GOD

MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR GOD FOR THE LIVING GOD

WHEN SHALL I COME AND APPEAR BEFORE GOD

MY TEARS HAVE BEEN MY FOOD DAY AND NIGHT WHILE THEY SAY TO ME CONTINUALLY WHERE IS YOUR GOD

 THESE THINGS I REMEMBER AS I POUR OUT MY SOUL HOW I WOULD GO WITH THE THRONG AND LEAD THEM IN PROCESSION TO THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH GLAD SHOUTS AND SONGS OF PRAISE A MULTITUDE KEEPING FESTIVAL

WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN O MY SOUL AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITHIN ME

HOPE IN GOD; FOR I SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM MY SALVATION AND MY GOD

MY SOUL IS CAST DOWN WITHIN ME; THEREFORE I REMEMBER YOU FROM THE LAND OF JORDAN AND OF HERMON FROM MOUNT MIZAR

DEEP CALLS TO DEEP AT THE ROAR OF YOUR WATERFALLS; ALL YOUR BREAKERS AND YOUR WAVES HAVE GONE OVER ME

BY DAY THE LORD COMMANDS HIS STEADFAST LOVE AND AT NIGHT HIS SONG IS WITH ME A PRAYER TO THE GOD OF MY LIFE

I SAY TO GOD MY ROCK WHY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME

WHY DO I GO MOURNING BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE ENEMY

 AS WITH A DEADLY WOUND IN MY BONES MY ADVERSARIES TAUNT ME WHILE THEY SAY TO ME CONTINUALLY WHERE IS YOUR GOD

 WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN O MY SOUL AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITHIN ME

HOPE IN GOD; FOR I SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM MY SALVATION AND MY GOD

VINDICATE ME O GOD AND DEFEND MY CAUSE AGAINST AN UNGODLY PEOPLE FROM THE DECEITFUL AND UNJUST MAN DELIVER ME

FOR YOU ARE THE GOD IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE; WHY HAVE YOU REJECTED ME

WHY DO I GO ABOUT MOURNING BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE ENEMY

SEND OUT YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR TRUTH; LET THEM LEAD ME; LET THEM BRING ME TO YOUR HOLY HILL AND TO YOUR DWELLING

THEN I WILL GO TO THE ALTAR OF GOD TO GOD MY EXCEEDING JOY AND I WILL PRAISE YOU WITH THE LYRE O GOD MY GOD

WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN O MY SOUL AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITHIN ME

HOPE IN GOD; FOR I SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM MY SALVATION AND MY GOD

O GOD WE HAVE HEARD WITH OUR EARS OUR FATHERS HAVE TOLD US WHAT DEEDS YOU PERFORMED IN THEIR DAYS IN THE DAYS OF OLD YOU WITH YOUR OWN HAND DROVE OUT THE NATIONS BUT THEM YOU PLANTED; YOU AFFLICTED THE PEOPLES BUT THEM YOU SET FREE; FOR NOT BY THEIR OWN SWORD DID THEY WIN THE LAND NOR DID THEIR OWN ARM SAVE THEM BUT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR ARM AND THE LIGHT OF YOUR FACE FOR YOU DELIGHTED IN THEM

YOU ARE MY KING O GOD; ORDAIN SALVATION FOR JACOB

THROUGH YOU WE PUSH DOWN OUR FOES; THROUGH YOUR NAME WE TREAD DOWN THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST US

FOR NOT IN MY BOW DO I TRUST NOR CAN MY SWORD SAVE ME

BUT YOU HAVE SAVED US FROM OUR FOES AND HAVE PUT TO SHAME THOSE WHO HATE US

IN GOD WE HAVE BOASTED CONTINUALLY AND WE WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME FOREVER

SELAH BUT YOU HAVE REJECTED US AND DISGRACED US AND HAVE NOT GONE OUT WITH OUR ARMIES

YOU HAVE MADE US TURN BACK FROM THE FOE AND THOSE WHO HATE US HAVE GOTTEN SPOIL

YOU HAVE MADE US LIKE SHEEP FOR SLAUGHTER AND HAVE SCATTERED US AMONG THE NATIONS

YOU HAVE SOLD YOUR PEOPLE FOR A TRIFLE DEMANDING NO HIGH PRICE FOR THEM

YOU HAVE MADE US THE TAUNT OF OUR NEIGHBORS THE DERISION AND SCORN OF THOSE AROUND US

YOU HAVE MADE US A BYWORD AMONG THE NATIONS A LAUGHINGSTOCK AMONG THE PEOPLES

ALL DAY LONG MY DISGRACE IS BEFORE ME AND SHAME HAS COVERED MY FACE AT THE SOUND OF THE TAUNTER AND REVILER AT THE SIGHT OF THE ENEMY AND THE AVENGER

ALL THIS HAS COME UPON US THOUGH WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN FALSE TO YOUR COVENANT

OUR HEART HAS NOT TURNED BACK NOR HAVE OUR STEPS DEPARTED FROM YOUR WAY; YET YOU HAVE BROKEN US IN THE PLACE OF JACKALS AND COVERED US WITH THE SHADOW OF DEATH

IF WE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NAME OF OUR GOD OR SPREAD OUT OUR HANDS TO A FOREIGN GOD WOULD NOT GOD DISCOVER THIS

FOR HE KNOWS THE SECRETS OF THE HEART

YET FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL THE DAY LONG; WE ARE REGARDED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED

AWAKE

WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING O LORD

ROUSE YOURSELF

DO NOT REJECT US FOREVER

WHY DO YOU HIDE YOUR FACE

WHY DO YOU FORGET OUR AFFLICTION AND OPPRESSION

FOR OUR SOUL IS BOWED DOWN TO THE DUST; OUR BELLY CLINGS TO THE GROUND

RISE UP; COME TO OUR HELP

REDEEM US FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE

MY HEART OVERFLOWS WITH A PLEASING THEME; I ADDRESS MY VERSES TO THE KING; MY TONGUE IS LIKE THE PEN OF A READY SCRIBE

YOU ARE THE MOST HANDSOME OF THE SONS OF MEN; GRACE IS POURED UPON YOUR LIPS; THEREFORE GOD HAS BLESSED YOU FOREVER

GIRD YOUR SWORD ON YOUR THIGH O MIGHTY ONE IN YOUR SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY

IN YOUR MAJESTY RIDE OUT VICTORIOUSLY FOR THE CAUSE OF TRUTH AND MEEKNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS; LET YOUR RIGHT HAND TEACH YOU AWESOME DEEDS

YOUR ARROWS ARE SHARP IN THE HEART OF THE KING'S ENEMIES; THE PEOPLES FALL UNDER YOU

YOUR THRONE O GOD IS FOREVER AND EVER

THE SCEPTER OF YOUR KINGDOM IS A SCEPTER OF UPRIGHTNESS; YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED WICKEDNESS

THEREFORE GOD YOUR GOD HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS BEYOND YOUR COMPANIONS; YOUR ROBES ARE ALL FRAGRANT WITH MYRRH AND ALOES AND CASSIA

FROM IVORY PALACES STRINGED INSTRUMENTS MAKE YOU GLAD; DAUGHTERS OF KINGS ARE AMONG YOUR LADIES OF HONOR; AT YOUR RIGHT HAND STANDS THE QUEEN IN GOLD OF OPHIR

HEAR O DAUGHTER AND CONSIDER AND INCLINE YOUR EAR FORGET YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE AND THE KING WILL DESIRE YOUR BEAUTY

SINCE HE IS YOUR LORD BOW TO HIM

THE PEOPLE OF TYRE WILL SEEK YOUR FAVOR WITH GIFTS THE RICHEST OF THE PEOPLE

ALL GLORIOUS IS THE PRINCESS IN HER CHAMBER WITH ROBES INTERWOVEN WITH GOLD

IN MANYCOLORED ROBES SHE IS LED TO THE KING WITH HER VIRGIN COMPANIONS FOLLOWING BEHIND HER

WITH JOY AND GLADNESS THEY ARE LED ALONG AS THEY ENTER THE PALACE OF THE KING

IN PLACE OF YOUR FATHERS SHALL BE YOUR SONS; YOU WILL MAKE THEM PRINCES IN ALL THE EARTH

I WILL CAUSE YOUR NAME TO BE REMEMBERED IN ALL GENERATIONS; THEREFORE NATIONS WILL PRAISE YOU FOREVER AND EVER

GOD IS OUR REFUGE AND STRENGTH A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TROUBLE

THEREFORE WE WILL NOT FEAR THOUGH THE EARTH GIVES WAY THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS BE MOVED INTO THE HEART OF THE SEA THOUGH ITS WATERS ROAR AND FOAM THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE AT ITS SWELLING

SELAH THERE IS A RIVER WHOSE STREAMS MAKE GLAD THE CITY OF GOD THE HOLY HABITATION OF THE MOST HIGH

GOD IS IN THE MIDST OF HER; SHE SHALL NOT BE MOVED; GOD WILL HELP HER WHEN MORNING DAWNS

THE NATIONS RAGE THE KINGDOMS TOTTER; HE UTTERS HIS VOICE THE EARTH MELTS

THE LORD OF HOSTS IS WITH US; THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR FORTRESS

SELAH COME BEHOLD THE WORKS OF THE LORD HOW HE HAS BROUGHT DESOLATIONS ON THE EARTH

HE MAKES WARS CEASE TO THE END OF THE EARTH; HE BREAKS THE BOW AND SHATTERS THE SPEAR; HE BURNS THE CHARIOTS WITH FIRE

BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD

I WILL BE EXALTED AMONG THE NATIONS I WILL BE EXALTED IN THE EARTH

 THE LORD OF HOSTS IS WITH US; THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR FORTRESS

SELAHCLAP YOUR HANDS ALL PEOPLES

SHOUT TO GOD WITH LOUD SONGS OF JOY

FOR THE LORD THE MOST HIGH IS TO BE FEARED A GREAT KING OVER ALL THE EARTH

HE SUBDUED PEOPLES UNDER US AND NATIONS UNDER OUR FEET

HE CHOSE OUR HERITAGE FOR US THE PRIDE OF JACOB WHOM HE LOVES

SELAH GOD HAS GONE UP WITH A SHOUT THE LORD WITH THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET

SING PRAISES TO GOD SING PRAISES

SING PRAISES TO OUR KING SING PRAISES

FOR GOD IS THE KING OF ALL THE EARTH; SING PRAISES WITH A PSALM

GOD REIGNS OVER THE NATIONS; GOD SITS ON HIS HOLY THRONE

THE PRINCES OF THE PEOPLES GATHER AS THE PEOPLE OF THE GOD OF ABRAHAM

FOR THE SHIELDS OF THE EARTH BELONG TO GOD; HE IS HIGHLY EXALTED

GREAT IS THE LORD AND GREATLY TO BE PRAISED IN THE CITY OF OUR GOD

HIS HOLY MOUNTAIN BEAUTIFUL IN ELEVATION IS THE JOY OF ALL THE EARTH MOUNT ZION IN THE FAR NORTH THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING

WITHIN HER CITADELS GOD HAS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN AS A FORTRESS

FOR BEHOLD THE KINGS ASSEMBLED; THEY CAME ON TOGETHER

AS SOON AS THEY SAW IT THEY WERE ASTOUNDED; THEY WERE IN PANIC; THEY TOOK TO FLIGHT

TREMBLING TOOK HOLD OF THEM THERE ANGUISH AS OF A WOMAN IN LABOR

BY THE EAST WIND YOU SHATTERED THE SHIPS OF TARSHISH

AS WE HAVE HEARD SO HAVE WE SEEN IN THE CITY OF THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THE CITY OF OUR GOD WHICH GOD WILL ESTABLISH FOREVER

SELAH WE HAVE THOUGHT ON YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O GOD IN THE MIDST OF YOUR TEMPLE

AS YOUR NAME O GOD SO YOUR PRAISE REACHES TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

YOUR RIGHT HAND IS FILLED WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS

LET MOUNT ZION BE GLAD

LET THE DAUGHTERS OF JUDAH REJOICE BECAUSE OF YOUR JUDGMENTS

WALK ABOUT ZION GO AROUND HER NUMBER HER TOWERS CONSIDER WELL HER RAMPARTS GO THROUGH HER CITADELS THAT YOU MAY TELL THE NEXT GENERATION THAT THIS IS GOD OUR GOD FOREVER AND EVER

HE WILL GUIDE US FOREVER

HEAR THIS ALL PEOPLES

GIVE EAR ALL INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD BOTH LOW AND HIGH RICH AND POOR TOGETHER

MY MOUTH SHALL SPEAK WISDOM; THE MEDITATION OF MY HEART SHALL BE UNDERSTANDING

I WILL INCLINE MY EAR TO A PROVERB; I WILL SOLVE MY RIDDLE TO THE MUSIC OF THE LYRE

WHY SHOULD I FEAR IN TIMES OF TROUBLE WHEN THE INIQUITY OF THOSE WHO CHEAT ME SURROUNDS ME THOSE WHO TRUST IN THEIR WEALTH AND BOAST OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR RICHES

TRULY NO MAN CAN RANSOM ANOTHER OR GIVE TO GOD THE PRICE OF HIS LIFE FOR THE RANSOM OF THEIR LIFE IS COSTLY AND CAN NEVER SUFFICE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE ON FOREVER AND NEVER SEE THE PIT

FOR HE SEES THAT EVEN THE WISE DIE; THE FOOL AND THE STUPID ALIKE MUST PERISH AND LEAVE THEIR WEALTH TO OTHERS

THEIR GRAVES ARE THEIR HOMES FOREVER THEIR DWELLING PLACES TO ALL GENERATIONS THOUGH THEY CALLED LANDS BY THEIR OWN NAMES

MAN IN HIS POMP WILL NOT REMAIN; HE IS LIKE THE BEASTS THAT PERISH

THIS IS THE PATH OF THOSE WHO HAVE FOOLISH CONFIDENCE; YET AFTER THEM PEOPLE APPROVE OF THEIR BOASTS

SELAH LIKE SHEEP THEY ARE APPOINTED FOR SHEOL; DEATH SHALL BE THEIR SHEPHERD AND THE UPRIGHT SHALL RULE OVER THEM IN THE MORNING

THEIR FORM SHALL BE CONSUMED IN SHEOL WITH NO PLACE TO DWELL

BUT GOD WILL RANSOM MY SOUL FROM THE POWER OF SHEOL FOR HE WILL RECEIVE ME

SELAH BE NOT AFRAID WHEN A MAN BECOMES RICH WHEN THE GLORY OF HIS HOUSE INCREASES

FOR WHEN HE DIES HE WILL CARRY NOTHING AWAY; HIS GLORY WILL NOT GO DOWN AFTER HIM

FOR THOUGH WHILE HE LIVES HE COUNTS HIMSELF BLESSEDAND THOUGH YOU GET PRAISE WHEN YOU DO WELL FOR YOURSELF HIS SOUL WILL GO TO THE GENERATION OF HIS FATHERS WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE LIGHT

MAN IN HIS POMP YET WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IS LIKE THE BEASTS THAT PERISH

THE MIGHTY ONE GOD THE LORD SPEAKS AND SUMMONS THE EARTH FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING

OUT OF ZION THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY GOD SHINES FORTH

OUR GOD COMES; HE DOES NOT KEEP SILENCE; BEFORE HIM IS A DEVOURING FIRE AROUND HIM A MIGHTY TEMPEST

HE CALLS TO THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND TO THE EARTH THAT HE MAY JUDGE HIS PEOPLE GATHER TO ME MY FAITHFUL ONES WHO MADE A COVENANT WITH ME BY SACRIFICE

 THE HEAVENS DECLARE HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR GOD HIMSELF IS JUDGE

SELAH HEAR O MY PEOPLE AND I WILL SPEAK; O ISRAEL I WILL TESTIFY AGAINST YOU

I AM GOD YOUR GOD

NOT FOR YOUR SACRIFICES DO I REBUKE YOU; YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS ARE CONTINUALLY BEFORE ME

I WILL NOT ACCEPT A BULL FROM YOUR HOUSE OR GOATS FROM YOUR FOLDS

FOR EVERY BEAST OF THE FOREST IS MINE THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS

I KNOW ALL THE BIRDS OF THE HILLS AND ALL THAT MOVES IN THE FIELD IS MINE

IF I WERE HUNGRY I WOULD NOT TELL YOU FOR THE WORLD AND ITS FULLNESS ARE MINE

DO I EAT THE FLESH OF BULLS OR DRINK THE BLOOD OF GOATS

OFFER TO GOD A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING AND PERFORM YOUR VOWS TO THE MOST HIGH AND CALL UPON ME IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; I WILL DELIVER YOU AND YOU SHALL GLORIFY ME

 BUT TO THE WICKED GOD SAYS WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO RECITE MY STATUTES OR TAKE MY COVENANT ON YOUR LIPS

FOR YOU HATE DISCIPLINE AND YOU CAST MY WORDS BEHIND YOU

IF YOU SEE A THIEF YOU ARE PLEASED WITH HIM AND YOU KEEP COMPANY WITH ADULTERERS

YOU GIVE YOUR MOUTH FREE REIN FOR EVIL AND YOUR TONGUE FRAMES DECEIT

YOU SIT AND SPEAK AGAINST YOUR BROTHER; YOU SLANDER YOUR OWN MOTHER'S SON

THESE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE AND I HAVE BEEN SILENT; YOU THOUGHT THAT I WAS ONE LIKE YOURSELF

BUT NOW I REBUKE YOU AND LAY THE CHARGE BEFORE YOU

MARK THIS THEN YOU WHO FORGET GOD LEST I TEAR YOU APART AND THERE BE NONE TO DELIVER

THE ONE WHO OFFERS THANKSGIVING AS HIS SACRIFICE GLORIFIES ME; TO ONE WHO ORDERS HIS WAY RIGHTLY I WILL SHOW THE SALVATION OF GOD

HAVE MERCY ON ME O GOD ACCORDING TO YOUR STEADFAST LOVE; ACCORDING TO YOUR ABUNDANT MERCY BLOT OUT MY TRANSGRESSIONS

WASH ME THOROUGHLY FROM MY INIQUITY AND CLEANSE ME FROM MY SIN

FOR I KNOW MY TRANSGRESSIONS AND MY SIN IS EVER BEFORE ME

AGAINST YOU YOU ONLY HAVE I SINNED AND DONE WHAT IS EVIL IN YOUR SIGHT SO THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS AND BLAMELESS IN YOUR JUDGMENT

BEHOLD I WAS BROUGHT FORTH IN INIQUITY AND IN SIN DID MY MOTHER CONCEIVE ME

BEHOLD YOU DELIGHT IN TRUTH IN THE INWARD BEING AND YOU TEACH ME WISDOM IN THE SECRET HEART

PURGE ME WITH HYSSOP AND I SHALL BE CLEAN; WASH ME AND I SHALL BE WHITER THAN SNOW

LET ME HEAR JOY AND GLADNESS; LET THE BONES THAT YOU HAVE BROKEN REJOICE

HIDE YOUR FACE FROM MY SINS AND BLOT OUT ALL MY INIQUITIES

CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART O GOD AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT WITHIN ME

CAST ME NOT AWAY FROM YOUR PRESENCE AND TAKE NOT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT FROM ME

RESTORE TO ME THE JOY OF YOUR SALVATION AND UPHOLD ME WITH A WILLING SPIRIT

THEN I WILL TEACH TRANSGRESSORS YOUR WAYS AND SINNERS WILL RETURN TO YOU

DELIVER ME FROM BLOODGUILTINESS O GOD O GOD OF MY SALVATION AND MY TONGUE WILL SING ALOUD OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

O LORD OPEN MY LIPS AND MY MOUTH WILL DECLARE YOUR PRAISE

FOR YOU WILL NOT DELIGHT IN SACRIFICE OR I WOULD GIVE IT; YOU WILL NOT BE PLEASED WITH A BURNT OFFERING

THE SACRIFICES OF GOD ARE A BROKEN SPIRIT; A BROKEN AND CONTRITE HEART O GOD YOU WILL NOT DESPISE

DO GOOD TO ZION IN YOUR GOOD PLEASURE; BUILD UP THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM; THEN WILL YOU DELIGHT IN RIGHT SACRIFICES IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS; THEN BULLS WILL BE OFFERED ON YOUR ALTAR

WHY DO YOU BOAST OF EVIL O MIGHTY MAN

THE STEADFAST LOVE OF GOD ENDURES ALL THE DAY

YOUR TONGUE PLOTS DESTRUCTION LIKE A SHARP RAZOR YOU WORKER OF DECEIT

YOU LOVE EVIL MORE THAN GOOD AND LYING MORE THAN SPEAKING WHAT IS RIGHT

SELAH YOU LOVE ALL WORDS THAT DEVOUR O DECEITFUL TONGUE

BUT GOD WILL BREAK YOU DOWN FOREVER; HE WILL SNATCH AND TEAR YOU FROM YOUR TENT; HE WILL UPROOT YOU FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING

SELAH THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL SEE AND FEAR AND SHALL LAUGH AT HIM SAYING SEE THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT MAKE GOD HIS REFUGE BUT TRUSTED IN THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS RICHES AND SOUGHT REFUGE IN HIS OWN DESTRUCTION

 BUT I AM LIKE A GREEN OLIVE TREE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

I TRUST IN THE STEADFAST LOVE OF GOD FOREVER AND EVER

I WILL THANK YOU FOREVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE IT

I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR NAME FOR IT IS GOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GODLY

THE FOOL SAYS IN HIS HEART THERE IS NO GOD

 THEY ARE CORRUPT DOING ABOMINABLE INIQUITY; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD

GOD LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE CHILDREN OF MAN TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY WHO UNDERSTAND WHO SEEK AFTER GOD

THEY HAVE ALL FALLEN AWAY; TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME CORRUPT; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD NOT EVEN ONE

HAVE THOSE WHO WORK EVIL NO KNOWLEDGE WHO EAT UP MY PEOPLE AS THEY EAT BREAD AND DO NOT CALL UPON GOD

THERE THEY ARE IN GREAT TERROR WHERE THERE IS NO TERROR

FOR GOD SCATTERS THE BONES OF HIM WHO ENCAMPS AGAINST YOU; YOU PUT THEM TO SHAME FOR GOD HAS REJECTED THEM

OH THAT SALVATION FOR ISRAEL WOULD COME OUT OF ZION

WHEN GOD RESTORES THE FORTUNES OF HIS PEOPLE LET JACOB REJOICE LET ISRAEL BE GLAD

O GOD SAVE ME BY YOUR NAME AND VINDICATE ME BY YOUR MIGHT

O GOD HEAR MY PRAYER; GIVE EAR TO THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

FOR STRANGERS HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME; RUTHLESS MEN SEEK MY LIFE; THEY DO NOT SET GOD BEFORE THEMSELVES

SELAH BEHOLD GOD IS MY HELPER; THE LORD IS THE UPHOLDER OF MY LIFE

HE WILL RETURN THE EVIL TO MY ENEMIES; IN YOUR FAITHFULNESS PUT AN END TO THEM

WITH A FREEWILL OFFERING I WILL SACRIFICE TO YOU; I WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME O LORD FOR IT IS GOOD

FOR HE HAS DELIVERED ME FROM EVERY TROUBLE AND MY EYE HAS LOOKED IN TRIUMPH ON MY ENEMIES

GIVE EAR TO MY PRAYER O GOD AND HIDE NOT YOURSELF FROM MY PLEA FOR MERCY

ATTEND TO ME AND ANSWER ME; I AM RESTLESS IN MY COMPLAINT AND I MOAN BECAUSE OF THE NOISE OF THE ENEMY BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE WICKED

FOR THEY DROP TROUBLE UPON ME AND IN ANGER THEY BEAR A GRUDGE AGAINST ME

MY HEART IS IN ANGUISH WITHIN ME; THE TERRORS OF DEATH HAVE FALLEN UPON ME

FEAR AND TREMBLING COME UPON ME AND HORROR OVERWHELMS ME

AND I SAY OH THAT I HAD WINGS LIKE A DOVE

I WOULD FLY AWAY AND BE AT REST; YES I WOULD WANDER FAR AWAY; I WOULD LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS; SELAH I WOULD HURRY TO FIND A SHELTER FROM THE RAGING WIND AND TEMPEST

 DESTROY O LORD DIVIDE THEIR TONGUES; FOR I SEE VIOLENCE AND STRIFE IN THE CITY

DAY AND NIGHT THEY GO AROUND IT ON ITS WALLS AND INIQUITY AND TROUBLE ARE WITHIN IT; RUIN IS IN ITS MIDST; OPPRESSION AND FRAUD DO NOT DEPART FROM ITS MARKETPLACE

FOR IT IS NOT AN ENEMY WHO TAUNTS METHEN I COULD BEAR IT; IT IS NOT AN ADVERSARY WHO DEALS INSOLENTLY WITH METHEN I COULD HIDE FROM HIM

BUT IT IS YOU A MAN MY EQUAL MY COMPANION MY FAMILIAR FRIEND

WE USED TO TAKE SWEET COUNSEL TOGETHER; WITHIN GOD'S HOUSE WE WALKED IN THE THRONG

LET DEATH STEAL OVER THEM; LET THEM GO DOWN TO SHEOL ALIVE; FOR EVIL IS IN THEIR DWELLING PLACE AND IN THEIR HEART

BUT I CALL TO GOD AND THE LORD WILL SAVE ME

EVENING AND MORNING AND AT NOON I UTTER MY COMPLAINT AND MOAN AND HE HEARS MY VOICE

HE REDEEMS MY SOUL IN SAFETY FROM THE BATTLE THAT I WAGE FOR MANY ARE ARRAYED AGAINST ME

GOD WILL GIVE EAR AND HUMBLE THEM HE WHO IS ENTHRONED FROM OF OLD SELAH BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CHANGE AND DO NOT FEAR GOD

MY COMPANION STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AGAINST HIS FRIENDS; HE VIOLATED HIS COVENANT

HIS SPEECH WAS SMOOTH AS BUTTER YET WAR WAS IN HIS HEART; HIS WORDS WERE SOFTER THAN OIL YET THEY WERE DRAWN SWORDS

CAST YOUR BURDEN ON THE LORD AND HE WILL SUSTAIN YOU; HE WILL NEVER PERMIT THE RIGHTEOUS TO BE MOVED

BUT YOU O GOD WILL CAST THEM DOWN INTO THE PIT OF DESTRUCTION; MEN OF BLOOD AND TREACHERY SHALL NOT LIVE OUT HALF THEIR DAYS

BUT I WILL TRUST IN YOU

BE GRACIOUS TO ME O GOD FOR MAN TRAMPLES ON ME; ALL DAY LONG AN ATTACKER OPPRESSES ME; MY ENEMIES TRAMPLE ON ME ALL DAY LONG FOR MANY ATTACK ME PROUDLY

WHEN I AM AFRAID I PUT MY TRUST IN YOU

IN GOD WHOSE WORD I PRAISE IN GOD I TRUST; I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID

WHAT CAN FLESH DO TO ME

ALL DAY LONG THEY INJURE MY CAUSE; ALL THEIR THOUGHTS ARE AGAINST ME FOR EVIL

THEY STIR UP STRIFE THEY LURK; THEY WATCH MY STEPS AS THEY HAVE WAITED FOR MY LIFE

FOR THEIR CRIME WILL THEY ESCAPE

IN WRATH CAST DOWN THE PEOPLES O GOD

YOU HAVE KEPT COUNT OF MY TOSSINGS; PUT MY TEARS IN YOUR BOTTLE

ARE THEY NOT IN YOUR BOOK

THEN MY ENEMIES WILL TURN BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I CALL

THIS I KNOW THAT GOD IS FOR ME

IN GOD WHOSE WORD I PRAISE IN THE LORD WHOSE WORD I PRAISE IN GOD I TRUST; I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID

WHAT CAN MAN DO TO ME

I MUST PERFORM MY VOWS TO YOU O GOD; I WILL RENDER THANK OFFERINGS TO YOU

FOR YOU HAVE DELIVERED MY SOUL FROM DEATH YES MY FEET FROM FALLING THAT I MAY WALK BEFORE GOD IN THE LIGHT OF LIFE

BE MERCIFUL TO ME O GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME FOR IN YOU MY SOUL TAKES REFUGE; IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS I WILL TAKE REFUGE TILL THE STORMS OF DESTRUCTION PASS BY

I CRY OUT TO GOD MOST HIGH TO GOD WHO FULFILLS HIS PURPOSE FOR ME

HE WILL SEND FROM HEAVEN AND SAVE ME; HE WILL PUT TO SHAME HIM WHO TRAMPLES ON ME

SELAH GOD WILL SEND OUT HIS STEADFAST LOVE AND HIS FAITHFULNESS

MY SOUL IS IN THE MIDST OF LIONS; I LIE DOWN AMID FIERY BEASTSTHE CHILDREN OF MAN WHOSE TEETH ARE SPEARS AND ARROWS WHOSE TONGUES ARE SHARP SWORDS

BE EXALTED O GOD ABOVE THE HEAVENS

LET YOUR GLORY BE OVER ALL THE EARTH

THEY SET A NET FOR MY STEPS; MY SOUL WAS BOWED DOWN

THEY DUG A PIT IN MY WAY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN INTO IT THEMSELVES

SELAH MY HEART IS STEADFAST O GOD MY HEART IS STEADFAST

I WILL SING AND MAKE MELODY

AWAKE MY GLORY

AWAKE O HARP AND LYRE

I WILL AWAKE THE DAWN

I WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU O LORD AMONG THE PEOPLES; I WILL SING PRAISES TO YOU AMONG THE NATIONS

FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS GREAT TO THE HEAVENS YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO THE CLOUDS

BE EXALTED O GOD ABOVE THE HEAVENS

LET YOUR GLORY BE OVER ALL THE EARTH

DO YOU INDEED DECREE WHAT IS RIGHT YOU GODS

DO YOU JUDGE THE CHILDREN OF MAN UPRIGHTLY

NO IN YOUR HEARTS YOU DEVISE WRONGS; YOUR HANDS DEAL OUT VIOLENCE ON EARTH

THE WICKED ARE ESTRANGED FROM THE WOMB; THEY GO ASTRAY FROM BIRTH SPEAKING LIES

THEY HAVE VENOM LIKE THE VENOM OF A SERPENT LIKE THE DEAF ADDER THAT STOPS ITS EAR SO THAT IT DOES NOT HEAR THE VOICE OF CHARMERS OR OF THE CUNNING ENCHANTER

O GOD BREAK THE TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS; TEAR OUT THE FANGS OF THE YOUNG LIONS O LORD

LET THEM VANISH LIKE WATER THAT RUNS AWAY; WHEN HE AIMS HIS ARROWS LET THEM BE BLUNTED

LET THEM BE LIKE THE SNAIL THAT DISSOLVES INTO SLIME LIKE THE STILLBORN CHILD WHO NEVER SEES THE SUN

SOONER THAN YOUR POTS CAN FEEL THE HEAT OF THORNS WHETHER GREEN OR ABLAZE MAY HE SWEEP THEM AWAY

THE RIGHTEOUS WILL REJOICE WHEN HE SEES THE VENGEANCE; HE WILL BATHE HIS FEET IN THE BLOOD OF THE WICKED

MANKIND WILL SAY SURELY THERE IS A REWARD FOR THE RIGHTEOUS; SURELY THERE IS A GOD WHO JUDGES ON EARTH

DELIVER ME FROM MY ENEMIES O MY GOD; PROTECT ME FROM THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST ME; DELIVER ME FROM THOSE WHO WORK EVIL AND SAVE ME FROM BLOODTHIRSTY MEN

FOR BEHOLD THEY LIE IN WAIT FOR MY LIFE; FIERCE MEN STIR UP STRIFE AGAINST ME

FOR NO TRANSGRESSION OR SIN OF MINE O LORD FOR NO FAULT OF MINE THEY RUN AND MAKE READY

AWAKE COME TO MEET ME AND SEE

YOU LORD GOD OF HOSTS ARE GOD OF ISRAEL

ROUSE YOURSELF TO PUNISH ALL THE NATIONS; SPARE NONE OF THOSE WHO TREACHEROUSLY PLOT EVIL

SELAH EACH EVENING THEY COME BACK HOWLING LIKE DOGS AND PROWLING ABOUT THE CITY

THERE THEY ARE BELLOWING WITH THEIR MOUTHS WITH SWORDS IN THEIR LIPSFOR WHO THEY THINK WILL HEAR US

 BUT YOU O LORD LAUGH AT THEM; YOU HOLD ALL THE NATIONS IN DERISION

O MY STRENGTH I WILL WATCH FOR YOU FOR YOU O GOD ARE MY FORTRESS

MY GOD IN HIS STEADFAST LOVE WILL MEET ME; GOD WILL LET ME LOOK IN TRIUMPH ON MY ENEMIES

KILL THEM NOT LEST MY PEOPLE FORGET; MAKE THEM TOTTER BY YOUR POWER AND BRING THEM DOWN O LORD OUR SHIELD

FOR THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTHS THE WORDS OF THEIR LIPS LET THEM BE TRAPPED IN THEIR PRIDE

FOR THE CURSING AND LIES THAT THEY UTTER CONSUME THEM IN WRATH; CONSUME THEM TILL THEY ARE NO MORE THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT GOD RULES OVER JACOB TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

SELAH EACH EVENING THEY COME BACK HOWLING LIKE DOGS AND PROWLING ABOUT THE CITY

THEY WANDER ABOUT FOR FOOD AND GROWL IF THEY DO NOT GET THEIR FILL

BUT I WILL SING OF YOUR STRENGTH; I WILL SING ALOUD OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IN THE MORNING

FOR YOU HAVE BEEN TO ME A FORTRESS AND A REFUGE IN THE DAY OF MY DISTRESS

O MY STRENGTH I WILL SING PRAISES TO YOU FOR YOU O GOD ARE MY FORTRESS THE GOD WHO SHOWS ME STEADFAST LOVE

O GOD YOU HAVE REJECTED US BROKEN OUR DEFENSES; YOU HAVE BEEN ANGRY; OH RESTORE US

YOU HAVE MADE THE LAND TO QUAKE; YOU HAVE TORN IT OPEN; REPAIR ITS BREACHES FOR IT TOTTERS

YOU HAVE MADE YOUR PEOPLE SEE HARD THINGS; YOU HAVE GIVEN US WINE TO DRINK THAT MADE US STAGGER

YOU HAVE SET UP A BANNER FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU THAT THEY MAY FLEE TO IT FROM THE BOW

SELAH THAT YOUR BELOVED ONES MAY BE DELIVERED GIVE SALVATION BY YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ANSWER US

GOD HAS SPOKEN IN HIS HOLINESS WITH EXULTATION I WILL DIVIDE UP SHECHEM AND PORTION OUT THE VALE OF SUCCOTH

GILEAD IS MINE; MANASSEH IS MINE; EPHRAIM IS MY HELMET; JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER

MOAB IS MY WASHBASIN; UPON EDOM I CAST MY SHOE; OVER PHILISTIA I SHOUT IN TRIUMPH

 WHO WILL BRING ME TO THE FORTIFIED CITY

WHO WILL LEAD ME TO EDOM

HAVE YOU NOT REJECTED US O GOD

YOU DO NOT GO FORTH O GOD WITH OUR ARMIES

OH GRANT US HELP AGAINST THE FOE FOR VAIN IS THE SALVATION OF MAN

WITH GOD WE SHALL DO VALIANTLY; IT IS HE WHO WILL TREAD DOWN OUR FOES

HEAR MY CRY O GOD LISTEN TO MY PRAYER; FROM THE END OF THE EARTH I CALL TO YOU WHEN MY HEART IS FAINT

LEAD ME TO THE ROCK THAT IS HIGHER THAN I FOR YOU HAVE BEEN MY REFUGE A STRONG TOWER AGAINST THE ENEMY

LET ME DWELL IN YOUR TENT FOREVER

LET ME TAKE REFUGE UNDER THE SHELTER OF YOUR WINGS

SELAH FOR YOU O GOD HAVE HEARD MY VOWS; YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE HERITAGE OF THOSE WHO FEAR YOUR NAME

PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE KING; MAY HIS YEARS ENDURE TO ALL GENERATIONS

MAY HE BE ENTHRONED FOREVER BEFORE GOD; APPOINT STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO WATCH OVER HIM

SO WILL I EVER SING PRAISES TO YOUR NAME AS I PERFORM MY VOWS DAY AFTER DAY

FOR GOD ALONE MY SOUL WAITS IN SILENCE; FROM HIM COMES MY SALVATION

HE ONLY IS MY ROCK AND MY SALVATION MY FORTRESS; I SHALL NOT BE GREATLY SHAKEN

HOW LONG WILL ALL OF YOU ATTACK A MAN TO BATTER HIM LIKE A LEANING WALL A TOTTERING FENCE

THEY ONLY PLAN TO THRUST HIM DOWN FROM HIS HIGH POSITION

THEY TAKE PLEASURE IN FALSEHOOD

THEY BLESS WITH THEIR MOUTHS BUT INWARDLY THEY CURSE

SELAH FOR GOD ALONE O MY SOUL WAIT IN SILENCE FOR MY HOPE IS FROM HIM

HE ONLY IS MY ROCK AND MY SALVATION MY FORTRESS; I SHALL NOT BE SHAKEN

ON GOD RESTS MY SALVATION AND MY GLORY; MY MIGHTY ROCK MY REFUGE IS GOD

TRUST IN HIM AT ALL TIMES O PEOPLE; POUR OUT YOUR HEART BEFORE HIM; GOD IS A REFUGE FOR US

SELAH THOSE OF LOW ESTATE ARE BUT A BREATH; THOSE OF HIGH ESTATE ARE A DELUSION; IN THE BALANCES THEY GO UP; THEY ARE TOGETHER LIGHTER THAN A BREATH

PUT NO TRUST IN EXTORTION; SET NO VAIN HOPES ON ROBBERY; IF RICHES INCREASE SET NOT YOUR HEART ON THEM

ONCE GOD HAS SPOKEN; TWICE HAVE I HEARD THIS THAT POWER BELONGS TO GOD AND THAT TO YOU O LORD BELONGS STEADFAST LOVE

FOR YOU WILL RENDER TO A MAN ACCORDING TO HIS WORK

O GOD YOU ARE MY GOD; EARNESTLY I SEEK YOU; MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR YOU; MY FLESH FAINTS FOR YOU AS IN A DRY AND WEARY LAND WHERE THERE IS NO WATER

SO I HAVE LOOKED UPON YOU IN THE SANCTUARY BEHOLDING YOUR POWER AND GLORY

BECAUSE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE MY LIPS WILL PRAISE YOU

SO I WILL BLESS YOU AS LONG AS I LIVE; IN YOUR NAME I WILL LIFT UP MY HANDS

MY SOUL WILL BE SATISFIED AS WITH FAT AND RICH FOOD AND MY MOUTH WILL PRAISE YOU WITH JOYFUL LIPS WHEN I REMEMBER YOU UPON MY BED AND MEDITATE ON YOU IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT; FOR YOU HAVE BEEN MY HELP AND IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS I WILL SING FOR JOY

MY SOUL CLINGS TO YOU; YOUR RIGHT HAND UPHOLDS ME

BUT THOSE WHO SEEK TO DESTROY MY LIFE SHALL GO DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH; THEY SHALL BE GIVEN OVER TO THE POWER OF THE SWORD; THEY SHALL BE A PORTION FOR JACKALS

BUT THE KING SHALL REJOICE IN GOD; ALL WHO SWEAR BY HIM SHALL EXULT FOR THE MOUTHS OF LIARS WILL BE STOPPED

HEAR MY VOICE O GOD IN MY COMPLAINT; PRESERVE MY LIFE FROM DREAD OF THE ENEMY

HIDE ME FROM THE SECRET PLOTS OF THE WICKED FROM THE THRONG OF EVILDOERS WHO WHET THEIR TONGUES LIKE SWORDS WHO AIM BITTER WORDS LIKE ARROWS SHOOTING FROM AMBUSH AT THE BLAMELESS SHOOTING AT HIM SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR

THEY HOLD FAST TO THEIR EVIL PURPOSE; THEY TALK OF LAYING SNARES SECRETLY THINKING WHO CAN SEE THEM

THEY SEARCH OUT INJUSTICE SAYING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A DILIGENT SEARCH

 FOR THE INWARD MIND AND HEART OF A MAN ARE DEEP

BUT GOD SHOOTS HIS ARROW AT THEM; THEY ARE WOUNDED SUDDENLY

THEY ARE BROUGHT TO RUIN WITH THEIR OWN TONGUES TURNED AGAINST THEM; ALL WHO SEE THEM WILL WAG THEIR HEADS

THEN ALL MANKIND FEARS; THEY TELL WHAT GOD HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AND PONDER WHAT HE HAS DONE

LET THE RIGHTEOUS ONE REJOICE IN THE LORD AND TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

LET ALL THE UPRIGHT IN HEART EXULT

PRAISE IS DUE TO YOU O GOD IN ZION AND TO YOU SHALL VOWS BE PERFORMED

O YOU WHO HEARS PRAYER TO YOU SHALL ALL FLESH COME

WHEN INIQUITIES PREVAIL AGAINST ME YOU ATONE FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS

BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS

WE SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HOUSE THE HOLINESS OF YOUR TEMPLE

BY AWESOME DEEDS YOU ANSWER US WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS O GOD OF OUR SALVATION THE HOPE OF ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND OF THE FARTHEST SEAS; THE ONE WHO BY HIS STRENGTH ESTABLISHED THE MOUNTAINS BEING GIRDED WITH MIGHT; WHO STILLS THE ROARING OF THE SEAS THE ROARING OF THEIR WAVES THE TUMULT OF THE PEOPLES SO THAT THOSE WHO DWELL AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH ARE IN AWE AT YOUR SIGNS

YOU MAKE THE GOING OUT OF THE MORNING AND THE EVENING TO SHOUT FOR JOY

YOU VISIT THE EARTH AND WATER IT; YOU GREATLY ENRICH IT; THE RIVER OF GOD IS FULL OF WATER; YOU PROVIDE THEIR GRAIN FOR SO YOU HAVE PREPARED IT

YOU WATER ITS FURROWS ABUNDANTLY SETTLING ITS RIDGES SOFTENING IT WITH SHOWERS AND BLESSING ITS GROWTH

YOU CROWN THE YEAR WITH YOUR BOUNTY; YOUR WAGON TRACKS OVERFLOW WITH ABUNDANCE

THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS OVERFLOW THE HILLS GIRD THEMSELVES WITH JOY THE MEADOWS CLOTHE THEMSELVES WITH FLOCKS THE VALLEYS DECK THEMSELVES WITH GRAIN THEY SHOUT AND SING TOGETHER FOR JOY

SHOUT FOR JOY TO GOD ALL THE EARTH; SING THE GLORY OF HIS NAME; GIVE TO HIM GLORIOUS PRAISE

SAY TO GOD HOW AWESOME ARE YOUR DEEDS

SO GREAT IS YOUR POWER THAT YOUR ENEMIES COME CRINGING TO YOU

ALL THE EARTH WORSHIPS YOU AND SINGS PRAISES TO YOU; THEY SING PRAISES TO YOUR NAME

 SELAH COME AND SEE WHAT GOD HAS DONE HE IS AWESOME IN HIS DEEDS TOWARD THE CHILDREN OF MAN

HE TURNED THE SEA INTO DRY LAND; THEY PASSED THROUGH THE RIVER ON FOOT

THERE DID WE REJOICE IN HIM WHO RULES BY HIS MIGHT FOREVER WHOSE EYES KEEP WATCH ON THE NATIONSLET NOT THE REBELLIOUS EXALT THEMSELVES

SELAH BLESS OUR GOD O PEOPLES; LET THE SOUND OF HIS PRAISE BE HEARD WHO HAS KEPT OUR SOUL AMONG THE LIVING AND HAS NOT LET OUR FEET SLIP

FOR YOU O GOD HAVE TESTED US; YOU HAVE TRIED US AS SILVER IS TRIED

YOU BROUGHT US INTO THE NET; YOU LAID A CRUSHING BURDEN ON OUR BACKS; YOU LET MEN RIDE OVER OUR HEADS; WE WENT THROUGH FIRE AND THROUGH WATER; YET YOU HAVE BROUGHT US OUT TO A PLACE OF ABUNDANCE

I WILL COME INTO YOUR HOUSE WITH BURNT OFFERINGS; I WILL PERFORM MY VOWS TO YOU THAT WHICH MY LIPS UTTERED AND MY MOUTH PROMISED WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE

I WILL OFFER TO YOU BURNT OFFERINGS OF FATTENED ANIMALS WITH THE SMOKE OF THE SACRIFICE OF RAMS; I WILL MAKE AN OFFERING OF BULLS AND GOATS

SELAH COME AND HEAR ALL YOU WHO FEAR GOD AND I WILL TELL WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR MY SOUL

I CRIED TO HIM WITH MY MOUTH AND HIGH PRAISE WAS ON MY TONGUE

IF I HAD CHERISHED INIQUITY IN MY HEART THE LORD WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED

BUT TRULY GOD HAS LISTENED; HE HAS ATTENDED TO THE VOICE OF MY PRAYER

BLESSED BE GOD BECAUSE HE HAS NOT REJECTED MY PRAYER OR REMOVED HIS STEADFAST LOVE FROM ME

MAY GOD BE GRACIOUS TO US AND BLESS US AND MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON US SELAH THAT YOUR WAY MAY BE KNOWN ON EARTH YOUR SAVING POWER AMONG ALL NATIONS

LET THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU O GOD; LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU

LET THE NATIONS BE GLAD AND SING FOR JOY FOR YOU JUDGE THE PEOPLES WITH EQUITY AND GUIDE THE NATIONS UPON EARTH

SELAH LET THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU O GOD; LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU

THE EARTH HAS YIELDED ITS INCREASE; GOD OUR GOD SHALL BLESS US

GOD SHALL BLESS US; LET ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH FEAR HIM

GOD SHALL ARISE HIS ENEMIES SHALL BE SCATTERED; AND THOSE WHO HATE HIM SHALL FLEE BEFORE HIM

AS SMOKE IS DRIVEN AWAY SO YOU SHALL DRIVE THEM AWAY; AS WAX MELTS BEFORE FIRE SO THE WICKED SHALL PERISH BEFORE GOD

BUT THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE GLAD; THEY SHALL EXULT BEFORE GOD; THEY SHALL BE JUBILANT WITH JOY

SING TO GOD SING PRAISES TO HIS NAME; LIFT UP A SONG TO HIM WHO RIDES THROUGH THE DESERTS; HIS NAME IS THE LORD; EXULT BEFORE HIM

FATHER OF THE FATHERLESS AND PROTECTOR OF WIDOWS IS GOD IN HIS HOLY HABITATION

GOD SETTLES THE SOLITARY IN A HOME; HE LEADS OUT THE PRISONERS TO PROSPERITY BUT THE REBELLIOUS DWELL IN A PARCHED LAND

O GOD WHEN YOU WENT OUT BEFORE YOUR PEOPLE WHEN YOU MARCHED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS SELAH THE EARTH QUAKED THE HEAVENS POURED DOWN RAIN BEFORE GOD THE ONE OF SINAI BEFORE GOD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

RAIN IN ABUNDANCE O GOD YOU SHED ABROAD; YOU RESTORED YOUR INHERITANCE AS IT LANGUISHED; YOUR FLOCK FOUND A DWELLING IN IT; IN YOUR GOODNESS O GOD YOU PROVIDED FOR THE NEEDY

THE LORD GIVES THE WORD; THE WOMEN WHO ANNOUNCE THE NEWS ARE A GREAT HOST THE KINGS OF THE ARMIESTHEY FLEE THEY FLEE

 THE WOMEN AT HOME DIVIDE THE SPOIL THOUGH YOU MEN LIE AMONG THE SHEEPFOLDSTHE WINGS OF A DOVE COVERED WITH SILVER ITS PINIONS WITH SHIMMERING GOLD

WHEN THE ALMIGHTY SCATTERS KINGS THERE LET SNOW FALL ON ZALMON

O MOUNTAIN OF GOD MOUNTAIN OF BASHAN; O MANYPEAKED MOUNTAIN MOUNTAIN OF BASHAN

WHY DO YOU LOOK WITH HATRED O MANYPEAKED MOUNTAIN AT THE MOUNT THAT GOD DESIRED FOR HIS ABODE YES WHERE THE LORD WILL DWELL FOREVER

THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWICE TEN THOUSAND THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS; THE LORD IS AMONG THEM; SINAI IS NOW IN THE SANCTUARY

YOU ASCENDED ON HIGH LEADING A HOST OF CAPTIVES IN YOUR TRAIN AND RECEIVING GIFTS AMONG MEN EVEN AMONG THE REBELLIOUS THAT THE LORD GOD MAY DWELL THERE

BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO DAILY BEARS US UP; GOD IS OUR SALVATION

SELAH OUR GOD IS A GOD OF SALVATION AND TO GOD THE LORD BELONG DELIVERANCES FROM DEATH

BUT GOD WILL STRIKE THE HEADS OF HIS ENEMIES THE HAIRY CROWN OF HIM WHO WALKS IN HIS GUILTY WAYS

THE LORD SAID I WILL BRING THEM BACK FROM BASHAN I WILL BRING THEM BACK FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA THAT YOU MAY STRIKE YOUR FEET IN THEIR BLOOD THAT THE TONGUES OF YOUR DOGS MAY HAVE THEIR PORTION FROM THE FOE

 YOUR PROCESSION IS SEEN O GOD THE PROCESSION OF MY GOD MY KING INTO THE SANCTUARY THE SINGERS IN FRONT THE MUSICIANS LAST BETWEEN THEM VIRGINS PLAYING TAMBOURINES BLESS GOD IN THE GREAT CONGREGATION THE LORD O YOU WHO ARE OF ISRAEL'S FOUNTAIN

 THERE IS BENJAMIN THE LEAST OF THEM IN THE LEAD THE PRINCES OF JUDAH IN THEIR THRONG THE PRINCES OF ZEBULUN THE PRINCES OF NAPHTALI

SUMMON YOUR POWER O GOD THE POWER O GOD BY WHICH YOU HAVE WORKED FOR US

BECAUSE OF YOUR TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM KINGS SHALL BEAR GIFTS TO YOU

REBUKE THE BEASTS THAT DWELL AMONG THE REEDS THE HERD OF BULLS WITH THE CALVES OF THE PEOPLES

TRAMPLE UNDERFOOT THOSE WHO LUST AFTER TRIBUTE; SCATTER THE PEOPLES WHO DELIGHT IN WAR

NOBLES SHALL COME FROM EGYPT; CUSH SHALL HASTEN TO STRETCH OUT HER HANDS TO GOD

O KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH SING TO GOD; SING PRAISES TO THE LORD SELAH TO HIM WHO RIDES IN THE HEAVENS THE ANCIENT HEAVENS; BEHOLD HE SENDS OUT HIS VOICE HIS MIGHTY VOICE

ASCRIBE POWER TO GOD WHOSE MAJESTY IS OVER ISRAEL AND WHOSE POWER IS IN THE SKIES

AWESOME IS GOD FROM HIS SANCTUARY; THE GOD OF ISRAELHE IS THE ONE WHO GIVES POWER AND STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE

BLESSED BE GOD

SAVE ME O GOD

FOR THE WATERS HAVE COME UP TO MY NECK

I SINK IN DEEP MIRE WHERE THERE IS NO FOOTHOLD; I HAVE COME INTO DEEP WATERS AND THE FLOOD SWEEPS OVER ME

I AM WEARY WITH MY CRYING OUT; MY THROAT IS PARCHED

MY EYES GROW DIM WITH WAITING FOR MY GOD

MORE IN NUMBER THAN THE HAIRS OF MY HEAD ARE THOSE WHO HATE ME WITHOUT CAUSE; MIGHTY ARE THOSE WHO WOULD DESTROY ME THOSE WHO ATTACK ME WITH LIES

WHAT I DID NOT STEAL MUST I NOW RESTORE

O GOD YOU KNOW MY FOLLY; THE WRONGS I HAVE DONE ARE NOT HIDDEN FROM YOU

LET NOT THOSE WHO HOPE IN YOU BE PUT TO SHAME THROUGH ME O LORD GOD OF HOSTS; LET NOT THOSE WHO SEEK YOU BE BROUGHT TO DISHONOR THROUGH ME O GOD OF ISRAEL

FOR IT IS FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I HAVE BORNE REPROACH THAT DISHONOR HAS COVERED MY FACE

I HAVE BECOME A STRANGER TO MY BROTHERS AN ALIEN TO MY MOTHER'S SONS

FOR ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE HAS CONSUMED ME AND THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACH YOU HAVE FALLEN ON ME

WHEN I WEPT AND HUMBLED MY SOUL WITH FASTING IT BECAME MY REPROACH

WHEN I MADE SACKCLOTH MY CLOTHING I BECAME A BYWORD TO THEM

I AM THE TALK OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THE GATE AND THE DRUNKARDS MAKE SONGS ABOUT ME

BUT AS FOR ME MY PRAYER IS TO YOU O LORD

AT AN ACCEPTABLE TIME O GOD IN THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE ANSWER ME IN YOUR SAVING FAITHFULNESS

DELIVER ME FROM SINKING IN THE MIRE; LET ME BE DELIVERED FROM MY ENEMIES AND FROM THE DEEP WATERS

LET NOT THE FLOOD SWEEP OVER ME OR THE DEEP SWALLOW ME UP OR THE PIT CLOSE ITS MOUTH OVER ME

ANSWER ME O LORD FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS GOOD; ACCORDING TO YOUR ABUNDANT MERCY TURN TO ME

HIDE NOT YOUR FACE FROM YOUR SERVANT; FOR I AM IN DISTRESS; MAKE HASTE TO ANSWER ME

DRAW NEAR TO MY SOUL REDEEM ME; RANSOM ME BECAUSE OF MY ENEMIES

YOU KNOW MY REPROACH AND MY SHAME AND MY DISHONOR; MY FOES ARE ALL KNOWN TO YOU

REPROACHES HAVE BROKEN MY HEART SO THAT I AM IN DESPAIR

I LOOKED FOR PITY BUT THERE WAS NONE AND FOR COMFORTERS BUT I FOUND NONE

THEY GAVE ME POISON FOR FOOD AND FOR MY THIRST THEY GAVE ME SOUR WINE TO DRINK

LET THEIR OWN TABLE BEFORE THEM BECOME A SNARE; AND WHEN THEY ARE AT PEACE LET IT BECOME A TRAP

LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE AND MAKE THEIR LOINS TREMBLE CONTINUALLY

POUR OUT YOUR INDIGNATION UPON THEM AND LET YOUR BURNING ANGER OVERTAKE THEM

MAY THEIR CAMP BE A DESOLATION; LET NO ONE DWELL IN THEIR TENTS

FOR THEY PERSECUTE HIM WHOM YOU HAVE STRUCK DOWN AND THEY RECOUNT THE PAIN OF THOSE YOU HAVE WOUNDED

ADD TO THEM PUNISHMENT UPON PUNISHMENT; MAY THEY HAVE NO ACQUITTAL FROM YOU

LET THEM BE BLOTTED OUT OF THE BOOK OF THE LIVING; LET THEM NOT BE ENROLLED AMONG THE RIGHTEOUS

BUT I AM AFFLICTED AND IN PAIN; LET YOUR SALVATION O GOD SET ME ON HIGH

I WILL PRAISE THE NAME OF GOD WITH A SONG; I WILL MAGNIFY HIM WITH THANKSGIVING

THIS WILL PLEASE THE LORD MORE THAN AN OX OR A BULL WITH HORNS AND HOOFS

WHEN THE HUMBLE SEE IT THEY WILL BE GLAD; YOU WHO SEEK GOD LET YOUR HEARTS REVIVE

FOR THE LORD HEARS THE NEEDY AND DOES NOT DESPISE HIS OWN PEOPLE WHO ARE PRISONERS

LET HEAVEN AND EARTH PRAISE HIM THE SEAS AND EVERYTHING THAT MOVES IN THEM

FOR GOD WILL SAVE ZION AND BUILD UP THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND PEOPLE SHALL DWELL THERE AND POSSESS IT; THE OFFSPRING OF HIS SERVANTS SHALL INHERIT IT AND THOSE WHO LOVE HIS NAME SHALL DWELL IN IT

MAKE HASTE O GOD TO DELIVER ME

O LORD MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME

LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND CONFUSION WHO SEEK MY LIFE

LET THEM BE TURNED BACK AND BROUGHT TO DISHONOR WHO DESIRE MY HURT

LET THEM TURN BACK BECAUSE OF THEIR SHAME WHO SAY AHA AHA

 MAY ALL WHO SEEK YOU REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN YOU

MAY THOSE WHO LOVE YOUR SALVATION SAY EVERMORE GOD IS GREAT

 BUT I AM POOR AND NEEDY; HASTEN TO ME O GOD

YOU ARE MY HELP AND MY DELIVERER; O LORD DO NOT DELAY

IN YOU O LORD DO I TAKE REFUGE; LET ME NEVER BE PUT TO SHAME

IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS DELIVER ME AND RESCUE ME; INCLINE YOUR EAR TO ME AND SAVE ME

BE TO ME A ROCK OF REFUGE TO WHICH I MAY CONTINUALLY COME; YOU HAVE GIVEN THE COMMAND TO SAVE ME FOR YOU ARE MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS

RESCUE ME O MY GOD FROM THE HAND OF THE WICKED FROM THE GRASP OF THE UNJUST AND CRUEL MAN

FOR YOU O LORD ARE MY HOPE MY TRUST O LORD FROM MY YOUTH

UPON YOU I HAVE LEANED FROM BEFORE MY BIRTH; YOU ARE HE WHO TOOK ME FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB

MY PRAISE IS CONTINUALLY OF YOU

I HAVE BEEN AS A PORTENT TO MANY BUT YOU ARE MY STRONG REFUGE

MY MOUTH IS FILLED WITH YOUR PRAISE AND WITH YOUR GLORY ALL THE DAY

DO NOT CAST ME OFF IN THE TIME OF OLD AGE; FORSAKE ME NOT WHEN MY STRENGTH IS SPENT

FOR MY ENEMIES SPEAK CONCERNING ME; THOSE WHO WATCH FOR MY LIFE CONSULT TOGETHER AND SAY GOD HAS FORSAKEN HIM; PURSUE AND SEIZE HIM FOR THERE IS NONE TO DELIVER HIM

 O GOD BE NOT FAR FROM ME; O MY GOD MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME

MAY MY ACCUSERS BE PUT TO SHAME AND CONSUMED; WITH SCORN AND DISGRACE MAY THEY BE COVERED WHO SEEK MY HURT

BUT I WILL HOPE CONTINUALLY AND WILL PRAISE YOU YET MORE AND MORE

MY MOUTH WILL TELL OF YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS OF YOUR DEEDS OF SALVATION ALL THE DAY FOR THEIR NUMBER IS PAST MY KNOWLEDGE

WITH THE MIGHTY DEEDS OF THE LORD GOD I WILL COME; I WILL REMIND THEM OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS YOURS ALONE

O GOD FROM MY YOUTH YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME AND I STILL PROCLAIM YOUR WONDROUS DEEDS

SO EVEN TO OLD AGE AND GRAY HAIRS O GOD DO NOT FORSAKE ME UNTIL I PROCLAIM YOUR MIGHT TO ANOTHER GENERATION YOUR POWER TO ALL THOSE TO COME

YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS O GOD REACHES THE HIGH HEAVENS

YOU WHO HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS O GOD WHO IS LIKE YOU

YOU WHO HAVE MADE ME SEE MANY TROUBLES AND CALAMITIES WILL REVIVE ME AGAIN; FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH YOU WILL BRING ME UP AGAIN

YOU WILL INCREASE MY GREATNESS AND COMFORT ME AGAIN

I WILL ALSO PRAISE YOU WITH THE HARP FOR YOUR FAITHFULNESS O MY GOD; I WILL SING PRAISES TO YOU WITH THE LYRE O HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

MY LIPS WILL SHOUT FOR JOY WHEN I SING PRAISES TO YOU; MY SOUL ALSO WHICH YOU HAVE REDEEMED

AND MY TONGUE WILL TALK OF YOUR RIGHTEOUS HELP ALL THE DAY LONG FOR THEY HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAME AND DISAPPOINTED WHO SOUGHT TO DO ME HURT

GIVE THE KING YOUR JUSTICE O GOD AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE ROYAL SON

MAY HE JUDGE YOUR PEOPLE WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND YOUR POOR WITH JUSTICE

LET THE MOUNTAINS BEAR PROSPERITY FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE HILLS IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

MAY HE DEFEND THE CAUSE OF THE POOR OF THE PEOPLE GIVE DELIVERANCE TO THE CHILDREN OF THE NEEDY AND CRUSH THE OPPRESSOR

MAY THEY FEAR YOU WHILE THE SUN ENDURES AND AS LONG AS THE MOON THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS

MAY HE BE LIKE RAIN THAT FALLS ON THE MOWN GRASS LIKE SHOWERS THAT WATER THE EARTH

IN HIS DAYS MAY THE RIGHTEOUS FLOURISH AND PEACE ABOUND TILL THE MOON BE NO MORE

MAY HE HAVE DOMINION FROM SEA TO SEA AND FROM THE RIVER TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

MAY DESERT TRIBES BOW DOWN BEFORE HIM AND HIS ENEMIES LICK THE DUST

MAY THE KINGS OF TARSHISH AND OF THE COASTLANDS RENDER HIM TRIBUTE; MAY THE KINGS OF SHEBA AND SEBA BRING GIFTS

MAY ALL KINGS FALL DOWN BEFORE HIM ALL NATIONS SERVE HIM

FOR HE DELIVERS THE NEEDY WHEN HE CALLS THE POOR AND HIM WHO HAS NO HELPER

HE HAS PITY ON THE WEAK AND THE NEEDY AND SAVES THE LIVES OF THE NEEDY

FROM OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE HE REDEEMS THEIR LIFE AND PRECIOUS IS THEIR BLOOD IN HIS SIGHT

LONG MAY HE LIVE; MAY GOLD OF SHEBA BE GIVEN TO HIM

MAY PRAYER BE MADE FOR HIM CONTINUALLY AND BLESSINGS INVOKED FOR HIM ALL THE DAY

MAY THERE BE ABUNDANCE OF GRAIN IN THE LAND; ON THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS MAY IT WAVE; MAY ITS FRUIT BE LIKE LEBANON; AND MAY PEOPLE BLOSSOM IN THE CITIES LIKE THE GRASS OF THE FIELD

MAY HIS NAME ENDURE FOREVER HIS FAME CONTINUE AS LONG AS THE SUN

MAY PEOPLE BE BLESSED IN HIM ALL NATIONS CALL HIM BLESSED

BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO ALONE DOES WONDROUS THINGS

BLESSED BE HIS GLORIOUS NAME FOREVER; MAY THE WHOLE EARTH BE FILLED WITH HIS GLORY

AMEN AND AMEN

THE PRAYERS OF DAVID THE SON OF JESSE ARE ENDED

TRULY GOD IS GOOD TO ISRAEL TO THOSE WHO ARE PURE IN HEART

BUT AS FOR ME MY FEET HAD ALMOST STUMBLED MY STEPS HAD NEARLY SLIPPED

FOR I WAS ENVIOUS OF THE ARROGANT WHEN I SAW THE PROSPERITY OF THE WICKED

FOR THEY HAVE NO PANGS UNTIL DEATH; THEIR BODIES ARE FAT AND SLEEK

THEY ARE NOT IN TROUBLE AS OTHERS ARE; THEY ARE NOT STRICKEN LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND

THEREFORE PRIDE IS THEIR NECKLACE; VIOLENCE COVERS THEM AS A GARMENT

THEIR EYES SWELL OUT THROUGH FATNESS; THEIR HEARTS OVERFLOW WITH FOLLIES

THEY SCOFF AND SPEAK WITH MALICE; LOFTILY THEY THREATEN OPPRESSION

THEY SET THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST THE HEAVENS AND THEIR TONGUE STRUTS THROUGH THE EARTH

THEREFORE HIS PEOPLE TURN BACK TO THEM AND FIND NO FAULT IN THEM

AND THEY SAY HOW CAN GOD KNOW

IS THERE KNOWLEDGE IN THE MOST HIGH

 BEHOLD THESE ARE THE WICKED; ALWAYS AT EASE THEY INCREASE IN RICHES

ALL IN VAIN HAVE I KEPT MY HEART CLEAN AND WASHED MY HANDS IN INNOCENCE

FOR ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE BEEN STRICKEN AND REBUKED EVERY MORNING

IF I HAD SAID I WILL SPEAK THUS I WOULD HAVE BETRAYED THE GENERATION OF YOUR CHILDREN

BUT WHEN I THOUGHT HOW TO UNDERSTAND THIS IT SEEMED TO ME A WEARISOME TASK UNTIL I WENT INTO THE SANCTUARY OF GOD; THEN I DISCERNED THEIR END

TRULY YOU SET THEM IN SLIPPERY PLACES; YOU MAKE THEM FALL TO RUIN

HOW THEY ARE DESTROYED IN A MOMENT SWEPT AWAY UTTERLY BY TERRORS

LIKE A DREAM WHEN ONE AWAKES O LORD WHEN YOU ROUSE YOURSELF YOU DESPISE THEM AS PHANTOMS

WHEN MY SOUL WAS EMBITTERED WHEN I WAS PRICKED IN HEART I WAS BRUTISH AND IGNORANT; I WAS LIKE A BEAST TOWARD YOU

NEVERTHELESS I AM CONTINUALLY WITH YOU; YOU HOLD MY RIGHT HAND

YOU GUIDE ME WITH YOUR COUNSEL AND AFTERWARD YOU WILL RECEIVE ME TO GLORY

WHOM HAVE I IN HEAVEN BUT YOU

AND THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT I DESIRE BESIDES YOU

MY FLESH AND MY HEART MAY FAIL BUT GOD IS THE STRENGTH OF MY HEART AND MY PORTION FOREVER

FOR BEHOLD THOSE WHO ARE FAR FROM YOU SHALL PERISH; YOU PUT AN END TO EVERYONE WHO IS UNFAITHFUL TO YOU

BUT FOR ME IT IS GOOD TO BE NEAR GOD; I HAVE MADE THE LORD GOD MY REFUGE THAT I MAY TELL OF ALL YOUR WORKS

O GOD WHY DO YOU CAST US OFF FOREVER

WHY DOES YOUR ANGER SMOKE AGAINST THE SHEEP OF YOUR PASTURE

REMEMBER YOUR CONGREGATION WHICH YOU HAVE PURCHASED OF OLD WHICH YOU HAVE REDEEMED TO BE THE TRIBE OF YOUR HERITAGE

REMEMBER MOUNT ZION WHERE YOU HAVE DWELT

DIRECT YOUR STEPS TO THE PERPETUAL RUINS; THE ENEMY HAS DESTROYED EVERYTHING IN THE SANCTUARY

YOUR FOES HAVE ROARED IN THE MIDST OF YOUR MEETING PLACE; THEY SET UP THEIR OWN SIGNS FOR SIGNS

THEY WERE LIKE THOSE WHO SWING AXES IN A FOREST OF TREES

AND ALL ITS CARVED WOOD THEY BROKE DOWN WITH HATCHETS AND HAMMERS

THEY SET YOUR SANCTUARY ON FIRE; THEY PROFANED THE DWELLING PLACE OF YOUR NAME BRINGING IT DOWN TO THE GROUND

THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES WE WILL UTTERLY SUBDUE THEM; THEY BURNED ALL THE MEETING PLACES OF GOD IN THE LAND

WE DO NOT SEE OUR SIGNS; THERE IS NO LONGER ANY PROPHET AND THERE IS NONE AMONG US WHO KNOWS HOW LONG

HOW LONG O GOD IS THE FOE TO SCOFF

IS THE ENEMY TO REVILE YOUR NAME FOREVER

WHY DO YOU HOLD BACK YOUR HAND YOUR RIGHT HAND

TAKE IT FROM THE FOLD OF YOUR GARMENT AND DESTROY THEM

YET GOD MY KING IS FROM OF OLD WORKING SALVATION IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH

YOU DIVIDED THE SEA BY YOUR MIGHT; YOU BROKE THE HEADS OF THE SEA MONSTERS ON THE WATERS

YOU CRUSHED THE HEADS OF LEVIATHAN; YOU GAVE HIM AS FOOD FOR THE CREATURES OF THE WILDERNESS

YOU SPLIT OPEN SPRINGS AND BROOKS; YOU DRIED UP EVERFLOWING STREAMS

YOURS IS THE DAY YOURS ALSO THE NIGHT; YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THE HEAVENLY LIGHTS AND THE SUN

YOU HAVE FIXED ALL THE BOUNDARIES OF THE EARTH; YOU HAVE MADE SUMMER AND WINTER

REMEMBER THIS O LORD HOW THE ENEMY SCOFFS AND A FOOLISH PEOPLE REVILES YOUR NAME

DO NOT DELIVER THE SOUL OF YOUR DOVE TO THE WILD BEASTS; DO NOT FORGET THE LIFE OF YOUR POOR FOREVER

HAVE REGARD FOR THE COVENANT FOR THE DARK PLACES OF THE LAND ARE FULL OF THE HABITATIONS OF VIOLENCE

LET NOT THE DOWNTRODDEN TURN BACK IN SHAME; LET THE POOR AND NEEDY PRAISE YOUR NAME

ARISE O GOD DEFEND YOUR CAUSE; REMEMBER HOW THE FOOLISH SCOFF AT YOU ALL THE DAY

DO NOT FORGET THE CLAMOR OF YOUR FOES THE UPROAR OF THOSE WHO RISE AGAINST YOU WHICH GOES UP CONTINUALLY

WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU O GOD; WE GIVE THANKS FOR YOUR NAME IS NEAR

WE RECOUNT YOUR WONDROUS DEEDS

AT THE SET TIME THAT I APPOINT I WILL JUDGE WITH EQUITY

WHEN THE EARTH TOTTERS AND ALL ITS INHABITANTS IT IS I WHO KEEP STEADY ITS PILLARS

SELAH I SAY TO THE BOASTFUL 'DO NOT BOAST' AND TO THE WICKED 'DO NOT LIFT UP YOUR HORN; DO NOT LIFT UP YOUR HORN ON HIGH OR SPEAK WITH HAUGHTY NECK

' FOR NOT FROM THE EAST OR FROM THE WEST AND NOT FROM THE WILDERNESS COMES LIFTING UP BUT IT IS GOD WHO EXECUTES JUDGMENT PUTTING DOWN ONE AND LIFTING UP ANOTHER

FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP WITH FOAMING WINE WELL MIXED AND HE POURS OUT FROM IT AND ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH SHALL DRAIN IT DOWN TO THE DREGS

BUT I WILL DECLARE IT FOREVER; I WILL SING PRAISES TO THE GOD OF JACOB

ALL THE HORNS OF THE WICKED I WILL CUT OFF BUT THE HORNS OF THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE LIFTED UP

IN JUDAH GOD IS KNOWN; HIS NAME IS GREAT IN ISRAEL

HIS ABODE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SALEM HIS DWELLING PLACE IN ZION

THERE HE BROKE THE FLASHING ARROWS THE SHIELD THE SWORD AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR

SELAH GLORIOUS ARE YOU MORE MAJESTIC THAN THE MOUNTAINS OF PREY

THE STOUTHEARTED WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR SPOIL; THEY SANK INTO SLEEP; ALL THE MEN OF WAR WERE UNABLE TO USE THEIR HANDS

AT YOUR REBUKE O GOD OF JACOB BOTH RIDER AND HORSE LAY STUNNED

BUT YOU YOU ARE TO BE FEARED

WHO CAN STAND BEFORE YOU WHEN ONCE YOUR ANGER IS ROUSED

FROM THE HEAVENS YOU UTTERED JUDGMENT; THE EARTH FEARED AND WAS STILL WHEN GOD AROSE TO ESTABLISH JUDGMENT TO SAVE ALL THE HUMBLE OF THE EARTH

SELAH SURELY THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE YOU; THE REMNANT OF WRATH YOU WILL PUT ON LIKE A BELT

MAKE YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD YOUR GOD AND PERFORM THEM; LET ALL AROUND HIM BRING GIFTS TO HIM WHO IS TO BE FEARED WHO CUTS OFF THE SPIRIT OF PRINCES WHO IS TO BE FEARED BY THE KINGS OF THE EARTH

I CRY ALOUD TO GOD ALOUD TO GOD AND HE WILL HEAR ME

IN THE DAY OF MY TROUBLE I SEEK THE LORD; IN THE NIGHT MY HAND IS STRETCHED OUT WITHOUT WEARYING; MY SOUL REFUSES TO BE COMFORTED

WHEN I REMEMBER GOD I MOAN; WHEN I MEDITATE MY SPIRIT FAINTS

SELAH YOU HOLD MY EYELIDS OPEN; I AM SO TROUBLED THAT I CANNOT SPEAK

I CONSIDER THE DAYS OF OLD THE YEARS LONG AGO

I SAID LET ME REMEMBER MY SONG IN THE NIGHT; LET ME MEDITATE IN MY HEART

 THEN MY SPIRIT MADE A DILIGENT SEARCH WILL THE LORD SPURN FOREVER AND NEVER AGAIN BE FAVORABLE

HAS HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOREVER CEASED

ARE HIS PROMISES AT AN END FOR ALL TIME

HAS GOD FORGOTTEN TO BE GRACIOUS

HAS HE IN ANGER SHUT UP HIS COMPASSION

 SELAH THEN I SAID I WILL APPEAL TO THIS TO THE YEARS OF THE RIGHT HAND OF THE MOST HIGH

 I WILL REMEMBER THE DEEDS OF THE LORD; YES I WILL REMEMBER YOUR WONDERS OF OLD

I WILL PONDER ALL YOUR WORK AND MEDITATE ON YOUR MIGHTY DEEDS

YOUR WAY O GOD IS HOLY

WHAT GOD IS GREAT LIKE OUR GOD

YOU ARE THE GOD WHO WORKS WONDERS; YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN YOUR MIGHT AMONG THE PEOPLES

YOU WITH YOUR ARM REDEEMED YOUR PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF JACOB AND JOSEPH

SELAH WHEN THE WATERS SAW YOU O GOD WHEN THE WATERS SAW YOU THEY WERE AFRAID; INDEED THE DEEP TREMBLED

THE CLOUDS POURED OUT WATER; THE SKIES GAVE FORTH THUNDER; YOUR ARROWS FLASHED ON EVERY SIDE

THE CRASH OF YOUR THUNDER WAS IN THE WHIRLWIND; YOUR LIGHTNINGS LIGHTED UP THE WORLD; THE EARTH TREMBLED AND SHOOK

YOUR WAY WAS THROUGH THE SEA YOUR PATH THROUGH THE GREAT WATERS; YET YOUR FOOTPRINTS WERE UNSEEN

YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK BY THE HAND OF MOSES AND AARON

GIVE EAR O MY PEOPLE TO MY TEACHING; INCLINE YOUR EARS TO THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH

I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN A PARABLE; I WILL UTTER DARK SAYINGS FROM OF OLD THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND KNOWN THAT OUR FATHERS HAVE TOLD US

WE WILL NOT HIDE THEM FROM THEIR CHILDREN BUT TELL TO THE COMING GENERATION THE GLORIOUS DEEDS OF THE LORD AND HIS MIGHT AND THE WONDERS THAT HE HAS DONE

HE ESTABLISHED A TESTIMONY IN JACOB AND APPOINTED A LAW IN ISRAEL WHICH HE COMMANDED OUR FATHERS TO TEACH TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT THE NEXT GENERATION MIGHT KNOW THEM THE CHILDREN YET UNBORN AND ARISE AND TELL THEM TO THEIR CHILDREN SO THAT THEY SHOULD SET THEIR HOPE IN GOD AND NOT FORGET THE WORKS OF GOD BUT KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS; AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THEIR FATHERS A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS GENERATION A GENERATION WHOSE HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST WHOSE SPIRIT WAS NOT FAITHFUL TO GOD

THE EPHRAIMITES ARMED WITH THE BOW TURNED BACK ON THE DAY OF BATTLE

THEY DID NOT KEEP GOD'S COVENANT BUT REFUSED TO WALK ACCORDING TO HIS LAW

THEY FORGOT HIS WORKS AND THE WONDERS THAT HE HAD SHOWN THEM

IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR FATHERS HE PERFORMED WONDERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT IN THE FIELDS OF ZOAN

HE DIVIDED THE SEA AND LET THEM PASS THROUGH IT AND MADE THE WATERS STAND LIKE A HEAP

IN THE DAYTIME HE LED THEM WITH A CLOUD AND ALL THE NIGHT WITH A FIERY LIGHT

HE SPLIT ROCKS IN THE WILDERNESS AND GAVE THEM DRINK ABUNDANTLY AS FROM THE DEEP

HE MADE STREAMS COME OUT OF THE ROCK AND CAUSED WATERS TO FLOW DOWN LIKE RIVERS

YET THEY SINNED STILL MORE AGAINST HIM REBELLING AGAINST THE MOST HIGH IN THE DESERT

THEY TESTED GOD IN THEIR HEART BY DEMANDING THE FOOD THEY CRAVED

THEY SPOKE AGAINST GOD SAYING CAN GOD SPREAD A TABLE IN THE WILDERNESS

HE STRUCK THE ROCK SO THAT WATER GUSHED OUT AND STREAMS OVERFLOWED

CAN HE ALSO GIVE BREAD OR PROVIDE MEAT FOR HIS PEOPLE

 THEREFORE WHEN THE LORD HEARD HE WAS FULL OF WRATH; A FIRE WAS KINDLED AGAINST JACOB; HIS ANGER ROSE AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IN GOD AND DID NOT TRUST HIS SAVING POWER

YET HE COMMANDED THE SKIES ABOVE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF HEAVEN AND HE RAINED DOWN ON THEM MANNA TO EAT AND GAVE THEM THE GRAIN OF HEAVEN

MAN ATE OF THE BREAD OF THE ANGELS; HE SENT THEM FOOD IN ABUNDANCE

HE CAUSED THE EAST WIND TO BLOW IN THE HEAVENS AND BY HIS POWER HE LED OUT THE SOUTH WIND; HE RAINED MEAT ON THEM LIKE DUST WINGED BIRDS LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEAS; HE LET THEM FALL IN THE MIDST OF THEIR CAMP ALL AROUND THEIR DWELLINGS

AND THEY ATE AND WERE WELL FILLED FOR HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY CRAVED

BUT BEFORE THEY HAD SATISFIED THEIR CRAVING WHILE THE FOOD WAS STILL IN THEIR MOUTHS THE ANGER OF GOD ROSE AGAINST THEM AND HE KILLED THE STRONGEST OF THEM AND LAID LOW THE YOUNG MEN OF ISRAEL

IN SPITE OF ALL THIS THEY STILL SINNED; DESPITE HIS WONDERS THEY DID NOT BELIEVE

SO HE MADE THEIR DAYS VANISH LIKE A BREATH AND THEIR YEARS IN TERROR

WHEN HE KILLED THEM THEY SOUGHT HIM; THEY REPENTED AND SOUGHT GOD EARNESTLY

THEY REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS THEIR ROCK THE MOST HIGH GOD THEIR REDEEMER

BUT THEY FLATTERED HIM WITH THEIR MOUTHS; THEY LIED TO HIM WITH THEIR TONGUES

THEIR HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST TOWARD HIM; THEY WERE NOT FAITHFUL TO HIS COVENANT

YET HE BEING COMPASSIONATE ATONED FOR THEIR INIQUITY AND DID NOT DESTROY THEM; HE RESTRAINED HIS ANGER OFTEN AND DID NOT STIR UP ALL HIS WRATH

HE REMEMBERED THAT THEY WERE BUT FLESH A WIND THAT PASSES AND COMES NOT AGAIN

HOW OFTEN THEY REBELLED AGAINST HIM IN THE WILDERNESS AND GRIEVED HIM IN THE DESERT

THEY TESTED GOD AGAIN AND AGAIN AND PROVOKED THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

THEY DID NOT REMEMBER HIS POWER OR THE DAY WHEN HE REDEEMED THEM FROM THE FOE WHEN HE PERFORMED HIS SIGNS IN EGYPT AND HIS MARVELS IN THE FIELDS OF ZOAN

HE TURNED THEIR RIVERS TO BLOOD SO THAT THEY COULD NOT DRINK OF THEIR STREAMS

HE SENT AMONG THEM SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH DEVOURED THEM AND FROGS WHICH DESTROYED THEM

HE GAVE THEIR CROPS TO THE DESTROYING LOCUST AND THE FRUIT OF THEIR LABOR TO THE LOCUST

HE DESTROYED THEIR VINES WITH HAIL AND THEIR SYCAMORES WITH FROST

HE GAVE OVER THEIR CATTLE TO THE HAIL AND THEIR FLOCKS TO THUNDERBOLTS

HE LET LOOSE ON THEM HIS BURNING ANGER WRATH INDIGNATION AND DISTRESS A COMPANY OF DESTROYING ANGELS

HE MADE A PATH FOR HIS ANGER; HE DID NOT SPARE THEM FROM DEATH BUT GAVE THEIR LIVES OVER TO THE PLAGUE

HE STRUCK DOWN EVERY FIRSTBORN IN EGYPT THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THEIR STRENGTH IN THE TENTS OF HAM

THEN HE LED OUT HIS PEOPLE LIKE SHEEP AND GUIDED THEM IN THE WILDERNESS LIKE A FLOCK

HE LED THEM IN SAFETY SO THAT THEY WERE NOT AFRAID BUT THE SEA OVERWHELMED THEIR ENEMIES

AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO HIS HOLY LAND TO THE MOUNTAIN WHICH HIS RIGHT HAND HAD WON

HE DROVE OUT NATIONS BEFORE THEM; HE APPORTIONED THEM FOR A POSSESSION AND SETTLED THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN THEIR TENTS

YET THEY TESTED AND REBELLED AGAINST THE MOST HIGH GOD AND DID NOT KEEP HIS TESTIMONIES BUT TURNED AWAY AND ACTED TREACHEROUSLY LIKE THEIR FATHERS; THEY TWISTED LIKE A DECEITFUL BOW

FOR THEY PROVOKED HIM TO ANGER WITH THEIR HIGH PLACES; THEY MOVED HIM TO JEALOUSY WITH THEIR IDOLS

WHEN GOD HEARD HE WAS FULL OF WRATH AND HE UTTERLY REJECTED ISRAEL

HE FORSOOK HIS DWELLING AT SHILOH THE TENT WHERE HE DWELT AMONG MANKIND AND DELIVERED HIS POWER TO CAPTIVITY HIS GLORY TO THE HAND OF THE FOE

HE GAVE HIS PEOPLE OVER TO THE SWORD AND VENTED HIS WRATH ON HIS HERITAGE

FIRE DEVOURED THEIR YOUNG MEN AND THEIR YOUNG WOMEN HAD NO MARRIAGE SONG

THEIR PRIESTS FELL BY THE SWORD AND THEIR WIDOWS MADE NO LAMENTATION

THEN THE LORD AWOKE AS FROM SLEEP LIKE A STRONG MAN SHOUTING BECAUSE OF WINE

AND HE PUT HIS ADVERSARIES TO ROUT; HE PUT THEM TO EVERLASTING SHAME

HE REJECTED THE TENT OF JOSEPH; HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM BUT HE CHOSE THE TRIBE OF JUDAH MOUNT ZION WHICH HE LOVES

HE BUILT HIS SANCTUARY LIKE THE HIGH HEAVENS LIKE THE EARTH WHICH HE HAS FOUNDED FOREVER

HE CHOSE DAVID HIS SERVANT AND TOOK HIM FROM THE SHEEPFOLDS; FROM FOLLOWING THE NURSING EWES HE BROUGHT HIM TO SHEPHERD JACOB HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL HIS INHERITANCE

WITH UPRIGHT HEART HE SHEPHERDED THEM AND GUIDED THEM WITH HIS SKILLFUL HAND

O GOD THE NATIONS HAVE COME INTO YOUR INHERITANCE; THEY HAVE DEFILED YOUR HOLY TEMPLE; THEY HAVE LAID JERUSALEM IN RUINS

THEY HAVE GIVEN THE BODIES OF YOUR SERVANTS TO THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS FOR FOOD THE FLESH OF YOUR FAITHFUL TO THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH

THEY HAVE POURED OUT THEIR BLOOD LIKE WATER ALL AROUND JERUSALEM AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO BURY THEM

WE HAVE BECOME A TAUNT TO OUR NEIGHBORS MOCKED AND DERIDED BY THOSE AROUND US

HOW LONG O LORD

WILL YOU BE ANGRY FOREVER

WILL YOUR JEALOUSY BURN LIKE FIRE

POUR OUT YOUR ANGER ON THE NATIONS THAT DO NOT KNOW YOU AND ON THE KINGDOMS THAT DO NOT CALL UPON YOUR NAME

FOR THEY HAVE DEVOURED JACOB AND LAID WASTE HIS HABITATION

DO NOT REMEMBER AGAINST US OUR FORMER INIQUITIES; LET YOUR COMPASSION COME SPEEDILY TO MEET US FOR WE ARE BROUGHT VERY LOW

HELP US O GOD OF OUR SALVATION FOR THE GLORY OF YOUR NAME; DELIVER US AND ATONE FOR OUR SINS FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE

WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY WHERE IS THEIR GOD

 LET THE AVENGING OF THE OUTPOURED BLOOD OF YOUR SERVANTS BE KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS BEFORE OUR EYES

LET THE GROANS OF THE PRISONERS COME BEFORE YOU; ACCORDING TO YOUR GREAT POWER PRESERVE THOSE DOOMED TO DIE

RETURN SEVENFOLD INTO THE LAP OF OUR NEIGHBORS THE TAUNTS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TAUNTED YOU O LORD

BUT WE YOUR PEOPLE THE SHEEP OF YOUR PASTURE WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU FOREVER; FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION WE WILL RECOUNT YOUR PRAISE

GIVE EAR O SHEPHERD OF ISRAEL YOU WHO LEAD JOSEPH LIKE A FLOCK

YOU WHO ARE ENTHRONED UPON THE CHERUBIM SHINE FORTH

BEFORE EPHRAIM AND BENJAMIN AND MANASSEH STIR UP YOUR MIGHT AND COME TO SAVE US

RESTORE US O GOD; LET YOUR FACE SHINE THAT WE MAY BE SAVED

O LORD GOD OF HOSTS HOW LONG WILL YOU BE ANGRY WITH YOUR PEOPLE'S PRAYERS

YOU HAVE FED THEM WITH THE BREAD OF TEARS AND GIVEN THEM TEARS TO DRINK IN FULL MEASURE

YOU MAKE US AN OBJECT OF CONTENTION FOR OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR ENEMIES LAUGH AMONG THEMSELVES

RESTORE US O GOD OF HOSTS; LET YOUR FACE SHINE THAT WE MAY BE SAVED

YOU BROUGHT A VINE OUT OF EGYPT; YOU DROVE OUT THE NATIONS AND PLANTED IT

YOU CLEARED THE GROUND FOR IT; IT TOOK DEEP ROOT AND FILLED THE LAND

THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH ITS SHADE THE MIGHTY CEDARS WITH ITS BRANCHES

IT SENT OUT ITS BRANCHES TO THE SEA AND ITS SHOOTS TO THE RIVER

WHY THEN HAVE YOU BROKEN DOWN ITS WALLS SO THAT ALL WHO PASS ALONG THE WAY PLUCK ITS FRUIT

THE BOAR FROM THE FOREST RAVAGES IT AND ALL THAT MOVE IN THE FIELD FEED ON IT

TURN AGAIN O GOD OF HOSTS

LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND SEE; HAVE REGARD FOR THIS VINE THE STOCK THAT YOUR RIGHT HAND PLANTED AND FOR THE SON WHOM YOU MADE STRONG FOR YOURSELF

THEY HAVE BURNED IT WITH FIRE; THEY HAVE CUT IT DOWN; MAY THEY PERISH AT THE REBUKE OF YOUR FACE

BUT LET YOUR HAND BE ON THE MAN OF YOUR RIGHT HAND THE SON OF MAN WHOM YOU HAVE MADE STRONG FOR YOURSELF

THEN WE SHALL NOT TURN BACK FROM YOU; GIVE US LIFE AND WE WILL CALL UPON YOUR NAME

RESTORE US O LORD GOD OF HOSTS

LET YOUR FACE SHINE THAT WE MAY BE SAVED

SING ALOUD TO GOD OUR STRENGTH; SHOUT FOR JOY TO THE GOD OF JACOB

RAISE A SONG; SOUND THE TAMBOURINE THE SWEET LYRE WITH THE HARP

BLOW THE TRUMPET AT THE NEW MOON AT THE FULL MOON ON OUR FEAST DAY

FOR IT IS A STATUTE FOR ISRAEL A RULE OF THE GOD OF JACOB

HE MADE IT A DECREE IN JOSEPH WHEN HE WENT OUT OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT

I HEAR A LANGUAGE I HAD NOT KNOWN I RELIEVED YOUR SHOULDER OF THE BURDEN; YOUR HANDS WERE FREED FROM THE BASKET

IN DISTRESS YOU CALLED AND I DELIVERED YOU; I ANSWERED YOU IN THE SECRET PLACE OF THUNDER; I TESTED YOU AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH

SELAH HEAR O MY PEOPLE WHILE I ADMONISH YOU

O ISRAEL IF YOU WOULD BUT LISTEN TO ME

THERE SHALL BE NO STRANGE GOD AMONG YOU; YOU SHALL NOT BOW DOWN TO A FOREIGN GOD

I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE AND I WILL FILL IT

BUT MY PEOPLE DID NOT LISTEN TO MY VOICE; ISRAEL WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO ME

SO I GAVE THEM OVER TO THEIR STUBBORN HEARTS TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN COUNSELS

OH THAT MY PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN TO ME THAT ISRAEL WOULD WALK IN MY WAYS

I WOULD SOON SUBDUE THEIR ENEMIES AND TURN MY HAND AGAINST THEIR FOES

THOSE WHO HATE THE LORD WOULD CRINGE TOWARD HIM AND THEIR FATE WOULD LAST FOREVER

BUT HE WOULD FEED YOU WITH THE FINEST OF THE WHEAT AND WITH HONEY FROM THE ROCK I WOULD SATISFY YOU

GOD HAS TAKEN HIS PLACE IN THE DIVINE COUNCIL; IN THE MIDST OF THE GODS HE HOLDS JUDGMENT HOW LONG WILL YOU JUDGE UNJUSTLY AND SHOW PARTIALITY TO THE WICKED

SELAH GIVE JUSTICE TO THE WEAK AND THE FATHERLESS; MAINTAIN THE RIGHT OF THE AFFLICTED AND THE DESTITUTE

RESCUE THE WEAK AND THE NEEDY; DELIVER THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE WICKED

 THEY HAVE NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR UNDERSTANDING THEY WALK ABOUT IN DARKNESS; ALL THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE SHAKEN

I SAID YOU ARE GODS SONS OF THE MOST HIGH ALL OF YOU; NEVERTHELESS LIKE MEN YOU SHALL DIE AND FALL LIKE ANY PRINCE

 ARISE O GOD JUDGE THE EARTH; FOR YOU SHALL INHERIT ALL THE NATIONS

O GOD DO NOT KEEP SILENCE; DO NOT HOLD YOUR PEACE OR BE STILL O GOD

FOR BEHOLD YOUR ENEMIES MAKE AN UPROAR; THOSE WHO HATE YOU HAVE RAISED THEIR HEADS

THEY LAY CRAFTY PLANS AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE; THEY CONSULT TOGETHER AGAINST YOUR TREASURED ONES

THEY SAY COME LET US WIPE THEM OUT AS A NATION; LET THE NAME OF ISRAEL BE REMEMBERED NO MORE

 FOR THEY CONSPIRE WITH ONE ACCORD; AGAINST YOU THEY MAKE A COVENANT THE TENTS OF EDOM AND THE ISHMAELITES MOAB AND THE HAGRITES GEBAL AND AMMON AND AMALEK PHILISTIA WITH THE INHABITANTS OF TYRE; ASSHUR ALSO HAS JOINED THEM; THEY ARE THE STRONG ARM OF THE CHILDREN OF LOT

SELAH DO TO THEM AS YOU DID TO MIDIAN AS TO SISERA AND JABIN AT THE RIVER KISHON WHO WERE DESTROYED AT ENDOR WHO BECAME DUNG FOR THE GROUND

MAKE THEIR NOBLES LIKE OREB AND ZEEB ALL THEIR PRINCES LIKE ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA WHO SAID LET US TAKE POSSESSION FOR OURSELVES OF THE PASTURES OF GOD

 O MY GOD MAKE THEM LIKE WHIRLING DUST LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND

AS FIRE CONSUMES THE FOREST AS THE FLAME SETS THE MOUNTAINS ABLAZE SO MAY YOU PURSUE THEM WITH YOUR TEMPEST AND TERRIFY THEM WITH YOUR HURRICANE

FILL THEIR FACES WITH SHAME THAT THEY MAY SEEK YOUR NAME O LORD

LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISMAYED FOREVER; LET THEM PERISH IN DISGRACE THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT YOU ALONE WHOSE NAME IS THE LORD ARE THE MOST HIGH OVER ALL THE EARTH

HOW LOVELY IS YOUR DWELLING PLACE O LORD OF HOSTS

MY SOUL LONGS YES FAINTS FOR THE COURTS OF THE LORD; MY HEART AND FLESH SING FOR JOY TO THE LIVING GOD

EVEN THE SPARROW FINDS A HOME AND THE SWALLOW A NEST FOR HERSELF WHERE SHE MAY LAY HER YOUNG AT YOUR ALTARS O LORD OF HOSTS MY KING AND MY GOD

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO DWELL IN YOUR HOUSE EVER SINGING YOUR PRAISE

SELAH BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE STRENGTH IS IN YOU IN WHOSE HEART ARE THE HIGHWAYS TO ZION

AS THEY GO THROUGH THE VALLEY OF BACA THEY MAKE IT A PLACE OF SPRINGS; THE EARLY RAIN ALSO COVERS IT WITH POOLS

THEY GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH; EACH ONE APPEARS BEFORE GOD IN ZION

O LORD GOD OF HOSTS HEAR MY PRAYER; GIVE EAR O GOD OF JACOB

SELAH BEHOLD OUR SHIELD O GOD; LOOK ON THE FACE OF YOUR ANOINTED

FOR A DAY IN YOUR COURTS IS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND ELSEWHERE

I WOULD RATHER BE A DOORKEEPER IN THE HOUSE OF MY GOD THAN DWELL IN THE TENTS OF WICKEDNESS

FOR THE LORD GOD IS A SUN AND SHIELD; THE LORD BESTOWS FAVOR AND HONOR

NO GOOD THING DOES HE WITHHOLD FROM THOSE WHO WALK UPRIGHTLY

O LORD OF HOSTS BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO TRUSTS IN YOU

LORD YOU WERE FAVORABLE TO YOUR LAND; YOU RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF JACOB

YOU FORGAVE THE INIQUITY OF YOUR PEOPLE; YOU COVERED ALL THEIR SIN

SELAH YOU WITHDREW ALL YOUR WRATH; YOU TURNED FROM YOUR HOT ANGER

RESTORE US AGAIN O GOD OF OUR SALVATION AND PUT AWAY YOUR INDIGNATION TOWARD US

WILL YOU BE ANGRY WITH US FOREVER

WILL YOU PROLONG YOUR ANGER TO ALL GENERATIONS

WILL YOU NOT REVIVE US AGAIN THAT YOUR PEOPLE MAY REJOICE IN YOU

SHOW US YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O LORD AND GRANT US YOUR SALVATION

LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD THE LORD WILL SPEAK FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE TO HIS PEOPLE TO HIS SAINTS; BUT LET THEM NOT TURN BACK TO FOLLY

SURELY HIS SALVATION IS NEAR TO THOSE WHO FEAR HIM THAT GLORY MAY DWELL IN OUR LAND

STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS MEET; RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE KISS EACH OTHER

FAITHFULNESS SPRINGS UP FROM THE GROUND AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LOOKS DOWN FROM THE SKY

YES THE LORD WILL GIVE WHAT IS GOOD AND OUR LAND WILL YIELD ITS INCREASE

RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL GO BEFORE HIM AND MAKE HIS FOOTSTEPS A WAY

INCLINE YOUR EAR O LORD AND ANSWER ME FOR I AM POOR AND NEEDY

PRESERVE MY LIFE FOR I AM GODLY; SAVE YOUR SERVANT WHO TRUSTS IN YOUYOU ARE MY GOD

BE GRACIOUS TO ME O LORD FOR TO YOU DO I CRY ALL THE DAY

GLADDEN THE SOUL OF YOUR SERVANT FOR TO YOU O LORD DO I LIFT UP MY SOUL

FOR YOU O LORD ARE GOOD AND FORGIVING ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE TO ALL WHO CALL UPON YOU

GIVE EAR O LORD TO MY PRAYER; LISTEN TO MY PLEA FOR GRACE

IN THE DAY OF MY TROUBLE I CALL UPON YOU FOR YOU ANSWER ME

THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS O LORD NOR ARE THERE ANY WORKS LIKE YOURS

ALL THE NATIONS YOU HAVE MADE SHALL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU O LORD AND SHALL GLORIFY YOUR NAME

FOR YOU ARE GREAT AND DO WONDROUS THINGS; YOU ALONE ARE GOD

TEACH ME YOUR WAY O LORD THAT I MAY WALK IN YOUR TRUTH; UNITE MY HEART TO FEAR YOUR NAME

I GIVE THANKS TO YOU O LORD MY GOD WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND I WILL GLORIFY YOUR NAME FOREVER

FOR GREAT IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE TOWARD ME; YOU HAVE DELIVERED MY SOUL FROM THE DEPTHS OF SHEOL

O GOD INSOLENT MEN HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST ME; A BAND OF RUTHLESS MEN SEEK MY LIFE AND THEY DO NOT SET YOU BEFORE THEM

BUT YOU O LORD ARE A GOD MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS

TURN TO ME AND BE GRACIOUS TO ME; GIVE YOUR STRENGTH TO YOUR SERVANT AND SAVE THE SON OF YOUR MAIDSERVANT

SHOW ME A SIGN OF YOUR FAVOR THAT THOSE WHO HATE ME MAY SEE AND BE PUT TO SHAME BECAUSE YOU LORD HAVE HELPED ME AND COMFORTED ME

ON THE HOLY MOUNT STANDS THE CITY HE FOUNDED; THE LORD LOVES THE GATES OF ZION MORE THAN ALL THE DWELLING PLACES OF JACOB

GLORIOUS THINGS OF YOU ARE SPOKEN O CITY OF GOD

SELAH AMONG THOSE WHO KNOW ME I MENTION RAHAB AND BABYLON; BEHOLD PHILISTIA AND TYRE WITH CUSHTHIS ONE WAS BORN THERE THEY SAY

AND OF ZION IT SHALL BE SAID THIS ONE AND THAT ONE WERE BORN IN HER; FOR THE MOST HIGH HIMSELF WILL ESTABLISH HER

THE LORD RECORDS AS HE REGISTERS THE PEOPLES THIS ONE WAS BORN THERE

 SELAH SINGERS AND DANCERS ALIKE SAY ALL MY SPRINGS ARE IN YOU

O LORD GOD OF MY SALVATION; I CRY OUT DAY AND NIGHT BEFORE YOU

LET MY PRAYER COME BEFORE YOU; INCLINE YOUR EAR TO MY CRY

FOR MY SOUL IS FULL OF TROUBLES AND MY LIFE DRAWS NEAR TO SHEOL

I AM COUNTED AMONG THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT; I AM A MAN WHO HAS NO STRENGTH LIKE ONE SET LOOSE AMONG THE DEAD LIKE THE SLAIN THAT LIE IN THE GRAVE LIKE THOSE WHOM YOU REMEMBER NO MORE FOR THEY ARE CUT OFF FROM YOUR HAND

YOU HAVE PUT ME IN THE DEPTHS OF THE PIT IN THE REGIONS DARK AND DEEP

YOUR WRATH LIES HEAVY UPON ME AND YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH ALL YOUR WAVES

SELAH YOU HAVE CAUSED MY COMPANIONS TO SHUN ME; YOU HAVE MADE ME A HORROR TO THEM

I AM SHUT IN SO THAT I CANNOT ESCAPE; MY EYE GROWS DIM THROUGH SORROW

EVERY DAY I CALL UPON YOU O LORD; I SPREAD OUT MY HANDS TO YOU

DO YOU WORK WONDERS FOR THE DEAD

DO THE DEPARTED RISE UP TO PRAISE YOU

SELAH IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE DECLARED IN THE GRAVE OR YOUR FAITHFULNESS IN ABADDON

ARE YOUR WONDERS KNOWN IN THE DARKNESS OR YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE LAND OF FORGETFULNESS

BUT I O LORD CRY TO YOU; IN THE MORNING MY PRAYER COMES BEFORE YOU

O LORD WHY DO YOU CAST MY SOUL AWAY

WHY DO YOU HIDE YOUR FACE FROM ME

AFFLICTED AND CLOSE TO DEATH FROM MY YOUTH UP I SUFFER YOUR TERRORS; I AM HELPLESS

YOUR WRATH HAS SWEPT OVER ME; YOUR DREADFUL ASSAULTS DESTROY ME

THEY SURROUND ME LIKE A FLOOD ALL DAY LONG; THEY CLOSE IN ON ME TOGETHER

YOU HAVE CAUSED MY BELOVED AND MY FRIEND TO SHUN ME; MY COMPANIONS HAVE BECOME DARKNESS

I WILL SING OF THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD FOREVER; WITH MY MOUTH I WILL MAKE KNOWN YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO ALL GENERATIONS

FOR I SAID STEADFAST LOVE WILL BE BUILT UP FOREVER; IN THE HEAVENS YOU WILL ESTABLISH YOUR FAITHFULNESS

 YOU HAVE SAID I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH MY CHOSEN ONE; I HAVE SWORN TO DAVID MY SERVANT 'I WILL ESTABLISH YOUR OFFSPRING FOREVER AND BUILD YOUR THRONE FOR ALL GENERATIONS

' SELAH LET THE HEAVENS PRAISE YOUR WONDERS O LORD YOUR FAITHFULNESS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE HOLY ONES

FOR WHO IN THE SKIES CAN BE COMPARED TO THE LORD

WHO AMONG THE HEAVENLY BEINGS IS LIKE THE LORD A GOD GREATLY TO BE FEARED IN THE COUNCIL OF THE HOLY ONES AND AWESOME ABOVE ALL WHO ARE AROUND HIM

O LORD GOD OF HOSTS WHO IS MIGHTY AS YOU ARE O LORD WITH YOUR FAITHFULNESS ALL AROUND YOU

YOU RULE THE RAGING OF THE SEA; WHEN ITS WAVES RISE YOU STILL THEM

YOU CRUSHED RAHAB LIKE A CARCASS; YOU SCATTERED YOUR ENEMIES WITH YOUR MIGHTY ARM

THE HEAVENS ARE YOURS; THE EARTH ALSO IS YOURS; THE WORLD AND ALL THAT IS IN IT YOU HAVE FOUNDED THEM

THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH YOU HAVE CREATED THEM; TABOR AND HERMON JOYOUSLY PRAISE YOUR NAME

YOU HAVE A MIGHTY ARM; STRONG IS YOUR HAND HIGH YOUR RIGHT HAND

RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE ARE THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR THRONE; STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS GO BEFORE YOU

BLESSED ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE FESTAL SHOUT WHO WALK O LORD IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR FACE WHO EXULT IN YOUR NAME ALL THE DAY AND IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE EXALTED

FOR YOU ARE THE GLORY OF THEIR STRENGTH; BY YOUR FAVOR OUR HORN IS EXALTED

FOR OUR SHIELD BELONGS TO THE LORD OUR KING TO THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

OF OLD YOU SPOKE IN A VISION TO YOUR GODLY ONE AND SAID I HAVE GRANTED HELP TO ONE WHO IS MIGHTY; I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE

I HAVE FOUND DAVID MY SERVANT; WITH MY HOLY OIL I HAVE ANOINTED HIM SO THAT MY HAND SHALL BE ESTABLISHED WITH HIM; MY ARM ALSO SHALL STRENGTHEN HIM

THE ENEMY SHALL NOT OUTWIT HIM; THE WICKED SHALL NOT HUMBLE HIM

I WILL CRUSH HIS FOES BEFORE HIM AND STRIKE DOWN THOSE WHO HATE HIM

MY FAITHFULNESS AND MY STEADFAST LOVE SHALL BE WITH HIM AND IN MY NAME SHALL HIS HORN BE EXALTED

I WILL SET HIS HAND ON THE SEA AND HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE RIVERS

HE SHALL CRY TO ME 'YOU ARE MY FATHER MY GOD AND THE ROCK OF MY SALVATION

' AND I WILL MAKE HIM THE FIRSTBORN THE HIGHEST OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH

MY STEADFAST LOVE I WILL KEEP FOR HIM FOREVER AND MY COVENANT WILL STAND FIRM FOR HIM

I WILL ESTABLISH HIS OFFSPRING FOREVER AND HIS THRONE AS THE DAYS OF THE HEAVENS

IF HIS CHILDREN FORSAKE MY LAW AND DO NOT WALK ACCORDING TO MY RULES IF THEY VIOLATE MY STATUTES AND DO NOT KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS THEN I WILL PUNISH THEIR TRANSGRESSION WITH THE ROD AND THEIR INIQUITY WITH STRIPES BUT I WILL NOT REMOVE FROM HIM MY STEADFAST LOVE OR BE FALSE TO MY FAITHFULNESS

I WILL NOT VIOLATE MY COVENANT OR ALTER THE WORD THAT WENT FORTH FROM MY LIPS

ONCE FOR ALL I HAVE SWORN BY MY HOLINESS; I WILL NOT LIE TO DAVID

HIS OFFSPRING SHALL ENDURE FOREVER HIS THRONE AS LONG AS THE SUN BEFORE ME

LIKE THE MOON IT SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER A FAITHFUL WITNESS IN THE SKIES

 SELAH BUT NOW YOU HAVE CAST OFF AND REJECTED; YOU ARE FULL OF WRATH AGAINST YOUR ANOINTED

YOU HAVE RENOUNCED THE COVENANT WITH YOUR SERVANT; YOU HAVE DEFILED HIS CROWN IN THE DUST

YOU HAVE BREACHED ALL HIS WALLS; YOU HAVE LAID HIS STRONGHOLDS IN RUINS

ALL WHO PASS BY PLUNDER HIM; HE HAS BECOME THE SCORN OF HIS NEIGHBORS

YOU HAVE EXALTED THE RIGHT HAND OF HIS FOES; YOU HAVE MADE ALL HIS ENEMIES REJOICE

YOU HAVE ALSO TURNED BACK THE EDGE OF HIS SWORD AND YOU HAVE NOT MADE HIM STAND IN BATTLE

YOU HAVE MADE HIS SPLENDOR TO CEASE AND CAST HIS THRONE TO THE GROUND

YOU HAVE CUT SHORT THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTH; YOU HAVE COVERED HIM WITH SHAME

SELAH HOW LONG O LORD

WILL YOU HIDE YOURSELF FOREVER

HOW LONG WILL YOUR WRATH BURN LIKE FIRE

REMEMBER HOW SHORT MY TIME IS

FOR WHAT VANITY YOU HAVE CREATED ALL THE CHILDREN OF MAN

WHAT MAN CAN LIVE AND NEVER SEE DEATH

WHO CAN DELIVER HIS SOUL FROM THE POWER OF SHEOL

SELAH LORD WHERE IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE OF OLD WHICH BY YOUR FAITHFULNESS YOU SWORE TO DAVID

REMEMBER O LORD HOW YOUR SERVANTS ARE MOCKED AND HOW I BEAR IN MY HEART THE INSULTS OF ALL THE MANY NATIONS WITH WHICH YOUR ENEMIES MOCK O LORD WITH WHICH THEY MOCK THE FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR ANOINTED

BLESSED BE THE LORD FOREVER

AMEN AND AMEN

LORD YOU HAVE BEEN OUR DWELLING PLACE IN ALL GENERATIONS

BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS WERE BROUGHT FORTH OR EVER YOU HAD FORMED THE EARTH AND THE WORLD FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING YOU ARE GOD

YOU RETURN MAN TO DUST AND SAY RETURN O CHILDREN OF MAN

 FOR A THOUSAND YEARS IN YOUR SIGHT ARE BUT AS YESTERDAY WHEN IT IS PAST OR AS A WATCH IN THE NIGHT

YOU SWEEP THEM AWAY AS WITH A FLOOD; THEY ARE LIKE A DREAM LIKE GRASS THAT IS RENEWED IN THE MORNING IN THE MORNING IT FLOURISHES AND IS RENEWED; IN THE EVENING IT FADES AND WITHERS

FOR WE ARE BROUGHT TO AN END BY YOUR ANGER; BY YOUR WRATH WE ARE DISMAYED

YOU HAVE SET OUR INIQUITIES BEFORE YOU OUR SECRET SINS IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR PRESENCE

FOR ALL OUR DAYS PASS AWAY UNDER YOUR WRATH; WE BRING OUR YEARS TO AN END LIKE A SIGH

THE YEARS OF OUR LIFE ARE SEVENTY OR EVEN BY REASON OF STRENGTH EIGHTY; YET THEIR SPAN IS BUT TOIL AND TROUBLE; THEY ARE SOON GONE AND WE FLY AWAY

WHO CONSIDERS THE POWER OF YOUR ANGER AND YOUR WRATH ACCORDING TO THE FEAR OF YOU

SO TEACH US TO NUMBER OUR DAYS THAT WE MAY GET A HEART OF WISDOM

RETURN O LORD

HOW LONG

HAVE PITY ON YOUR SERVANTS

SATISFY US IN THE MORNING WITH YOUR STEADFAST LOVE THAT WE MAY REJOICE AND BE GLAD ALL OUR DAYS

MAKE US GLAD FOR AS MANY DAYS AS YOU HAVE AFFLICTED US AND FOR AS MANY YEARS AS WE HAVE SEEN EVIL

LET YOUR WORK BE SHOWN TO YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR GLORIOUS POWER TO THEIR CHILDREN

LET THE FAVOR OF THE LORD OUR GOD BE UPON US AND ESTABLISH THE WORK OF OUR HANDS UPON US; YES ESTABLISH THE WORK OF OUR HANDS

HE WHO DWELLS IN THE SHELTER OF THE MOST HIGH WILL ABIDE IN THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY

I WILL SAY TO THE LORD MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD IN WHOM I TRUST

 FOR HE WILL DELIVER YOU FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE DEADLY PESTILENCE

HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS AND UNDER HIS WINGS YOU WILL FIND REFUGE; HIS FAITHFULNESS IS A SHIELD AND BUCKLER

YOU WILL NOT FEAR THE TERROR OF THE NIGHT NOR THE ARROW THAT FLIES BY DAY NOR THE PESTILENCE THAT STALKS IN DARKNESS NOR THE DESTRUCTION THAT WASTES AT NOONDAY

A THOUSAND MAY FALL AT YOUR SIDE TEN THOUSAND AT YOUR RIGHT HAND BUT IT WILL NOT COME NEAR YOU

YOU WILL ONLY LOOK WITH YOUR EYES AND SEE THE RECOMPENSE OF THE WICKED

BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE THE LORD YOUR DWELLING PLACETHE MOST HIGH WHO IS MY REFUGE NO EVIL SHALL BE ALLOWED TO BEFALL YOU NO PLAGUE COME NEAR YOUR TENT

FOR HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU IN ALL YOUR WAYS

ON THEIR HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE

YOU WILL TREAD ON THE LION AND THE ADDER; THE YOUNG LION AND THE SERPENT YOU WILL TRAMPLE UNDERFOOT

BECAUSE HE HOLDS FAST TO ME IN LOVE I WILL DELIVER HIM; I WILL PROTECT HIM BECAUSE HE KNOWS MY NAME

WHEN HE CALLS TO ME I WILL ANSWER HIM; I WILL BE WITH HIM IN TROUBLE; I WILL RESCUE HIM AND HONOR HIM

WITH LONG LIFE I WILL SATISFY HIM AND SHOW HIM MY SALVATION

IT IS GOOD TO GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD TO SING PRAISES TO YOUR NAME O MOST HIGH; TO DECLARE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IN THE MORNING AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS BY NIGHT TO THE MUSIC OF THE LUTE AND THE HARP TO THE MELODY OF THE LYRE

FOR YOU O LORD HAVE MADE ME GLAD BY YOUR WORK; AT THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS I SING FOR JOY

HOW GREAT ARE YOUR WORKS O LORD

YOUR THOUGHTS ARE VERY DEEP

THE STUPID MAN CANNOT KNOW; THE FOOL CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS THAT THOUGH THE WICKED SPROUT LIKE GRASS AND ALL EVILDOERS FLOURISH THEY ARE DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION FOREVER; BUT YOU O LORD ARE ON HIGH FOREVER

FOR BEHOLD YOUR ENEMIES O LORD FOR BEHOLD YOUR ENEMIES SHALL PERISH; ALL EVILDOERS SHALL BE SCATTERED

BUT YOU HAVE EXALTED MY HORN LIKE THAT OF THE WILD OX; YOU HAVE POURED OVER ME FRESH OIL

MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE DOWNFALL OF MY ENEMIES; MY EARS HAVE HEARD THE DOOM OF MY EVIL ASSAILANTS

THE RIGHTEOUS FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM TREE AND GROW LIKE A CEDAR IN LEBANON

THEY ARE PLANTED IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD; THEY FLOURISH IN THE COURTS OF OUR GOD

THEY STILL BEAR FRUIT IN OLD AGE; THEY ARE EVER FULL OF SAP AND GREEN TO DECLARE THAT THE LORD IS UPRIGHT; HE IS MY ROCK AND THERE IS NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IN HIM

THE LORD REIGNS; HE IS ROBED IN MAJESTY; THE LORD IS ROBED; HE HAS PUT ON STRENGTH AS HIS BELT

YES THE WORLD IS ESTABLISHED; IT SHALL NEVER BE MOVED

YOUR THRONE IS ESTABLISHED FROM OF OLD; YOU ARE FROM EVERLASTING

THE FLOODS HAVE LIFTED UP O LORD THE FLOODS HAVE LIFTED UP THEIR VOICE; THE FLOODS LIFT UP THEIR ROARING

MIGHTIER THAN THE THUNDERS OF MANY WATERS MIGHTIER THAN THE WAVES OF THE SEA THE LORD ON HIGH IS MIGHTY

YOUR DECREES ARE VERY TRUSTWORTHY; HOLINESS BEFITS YOUR HOUSE O LORD FOREVERMORE

O LORD GOD OF VENGEANCE O GOD OF VENGEANCE SHINE FORTH

RISE UP O JUDGE OF THE EARTH; REPAY TO THE PROUD WHAT THEY DESERVE

O LORD HOW LONG SHALL THE WICKED HOW LONG SHALL THE WICKED EXULT

THEY POUR OUT THEIR ARROGANT WORDS; ALL THE EVILDOERS BOAST

THEY CRUSH YOUR PEOPLE O LORD AND AFFLICT YOUR HERITAGE

THEY KILL THE WIDOW AND THE SOJOURNER AND MURDER THE FATHERLESS; AND THEY SAY THE LORD DOES NOT SEE; THE GOD OF JACOB DOES NOT PERCEIVE

 UNDERSTAND O DULLEST OF THE PEOPLE

FOOLS WHEN WILL YOU BE WISE

HE WHO PLANTED THE EAR DOES HE NOT HEAR

HE WHO FORMED THE EYE DOES HE NOT SEE

HE WHO DISCIPLINES THE NATIONS DOES HE NOT REBUKE

HE WHO TEACHES MAN KNOWLEDGE THE LORDKNOWS THE THOUGHTS OF MAN THAT THEY ARE BUT A BREATH

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU DISCIPLINE O LORD AND WHOM YOU TEACH OUT OF YOUR LAW TO GIVE HIM REST FROM DAYS OF TROUBLE UNTIL A PIT IS DUG FOR THE WICKED

FOR THE LORD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS PEOPLE; HE WILL NOT ABANDON HIS HERITAGE; FOR JUSTICE WILL RETURN TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND ALL THE UPRIGHT IN HEART WILL FOLLOW IT

WHO RISES UP FOR ME AGAINST THE WICKED

WHO STANDS UP FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS

IF THE LORD HAD NOT BEEN MY HELP MY SOUL WOULD SOON HAVE LIVED IN THE LAND OF SILENCE

WHEN I THOUGHT MY FOOT SLIPS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O LORD HELD ME UP

WHEN THE CARES OF MY HEART ARE MANY YOUR CONSOLATIONS CHEER MY SOUL

CAN WICKED RULERS BE ALLIED WITH YOU THOSE WHO FRAME INJUSTICE BY STATUTE

THEY BAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE LIFE OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND CONDEMN THE INNOCENT TO DEATH

BUT THE LORD HAS BECOME MY STRONGHOLD AND MY GOD THE ROCK OF MY REFUGE

HE WILL BRING BACK ON THEM THEIR INIQUITY AND WIPE THEM OUT FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS; THE LORD OUR GOD WILL WIPE THEM OUT

OH COME LET US SING TO THE LORD; LET US MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE ROCK OF OUR SALVATION

LET US COME INTO HIS PRESENCE WITH THANKSGIVING; LET US MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO HIM WITH SONGS OF PRAISE

FOR THE LORD IS A GREAT GOD AND A GREAT KING ABOVE ALL GODS

IN HIS HAND ARE THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH; THE HEIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE HIS ALSO

THE SEA IS HIS FOR HE MADE IT AND HIS HANDS FORMED THE DRY LAND

OH COME LET US WORSHIP AND BOW DOWN; LET US KNEEL BEFORE THE LORD OUR MAKER

FOR HE IS OUR GOD AND WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF HIS PASTURE AND THE SHEEP OF HIS HAND

TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS AT MERIBAH AS ON THE DAY AT MASSAH IN THE WILDERNESS WHEN YOUR FATHERS PUT ME TO THE TEST AND PUT ME TO THE PROOF THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN MY WORK

FOR FORTY YEARS I LOATHED THAT GENERATION AND SAID THEY ARE A PEOPLE WHO GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART AND THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN MY WAYS

 THEREFORE I SWORE IN MY WRATH THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST

OH SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG; SING TO THE LORD ALL THE EARTH

SING TO THE LORD BLESS HIS NAME; TELL OF HIS SALVATION FROM DAY TO DAY

DECLARE HIS GLORY AMONG THE NATIONS HIS MARVELOUS WORKS AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES

FOR GREAT IS THE LORD AND GREATLY TO BE PRAISED; HE IS TO BE FEARED ABOVE ALL GODS

FOR ALL THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES ARE WORTHLESS IDOLS BUT THE LORD MADE THE HEAVENS

SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY ARE BEFORE HIM; STRENGTH AND BEAUTY ARE IN HIS SANCTUARY

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD O FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLES ASCRIBE TO THE LORD GLORY AND STRENGTH

ASCRIBE TO THE LORD THE GLORY DUE HIS NAME; BRING AN OFFERING AND COME INTO HIS COURTS

WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE SPLENDOR OF HOLINESS; TREMBLE BEFORE HIM ALL THE EARTH

SAY AMONG THE NATIONS THE LORD REIGNS

YES THE WORLD IS ESTABLISHED; IT SHALL NEVER BE MOVED; HE WILL JUDGE THE PEOPLES WITH EQUITY

 LET THE HEAVENS BE GLAD AND LET THE EARTH REJOICE; LET THE SEA ROAR AND ALL THAT FILLS IT; LET THE FIELD EXULT AND EVERYTHING IN IT

THEN SHALL ALL THE TREES OF THE FOREST SING FOR JOY BEFORE THE LORD FOR HE COMES FOR HE COMES TO JUDGE THE EARTH

HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE PEOPLES IN HIS FAITHFULNESS

THE LORD REIGNS LET THE EARTH REJOICE; LET THE MANY COASTLANDS BE GLAD

CLOUDS AND THICK DARKNESS ARE ALL AROUND HIM; RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE ARE THE FOUNDATION OF HIS THRONE

FIRE GOES BEFORE HIM AND BURNS UP HIS ADVERSARIES ALL AROUND

HIS LIGHTNINGS LIGHT UP THE WORLD; THE EARTH SEES AND TREMBLES

THE MOUNTAINS MELT LIKE WAX BEFORE THE LORD BEFORE THE LORD OF ALL THE EARTH

THE HEAVENS PROCLAIM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THE PEOPLES SEE HIS GLORY

ALL WORSHIPERS OF IMAGES ARE PUT TO SHAME WHO MAKE THEIR BOAST IN WORTHLESS IDOLS; WORSHIP HIM ALL YOU GODS

ZION HEARS AND IS GLAD AND THE DAUGHTERS OF JUDAH REJOICE BECAUSE OF YOUR JUDGMENTS O LORD

FOR YOU O LORD ARE MOST HIGH OVER ALL THE EARTH; YOU ARE EXALTED FAR ABOVE ALL GODS

O YOU WHO LOVE THE LORD HATE EVIL

HE PRESERVES THE LIVES OF HIS SAINTS; HE DELIVERS THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE WICKED

LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND JOY FOR THE UPRIGHT IN HEART

REJOICE IN THE LORD O YOU RIGHTEOUS AND GIVE THANKS TO HIS HOLY NAME

OH SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG FOR HE HAS DONE MARVELOUS THINGS

HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS HOLY ARM HAVE WORKED SALVATION FOR HIM

THE LORD HAS MADE KNOWN HIS SALVATION; HE HAS REVEALED HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS

HE HAS REMEMBERED HIS STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH HAVE SEEN THE SALVATION OF OUR GOD

MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE LORD ALL THE EARTH; BREAK FORTH INTO JOYOUS SONG AND SING PRAISES

SING PRAISES TO THE LORD WITH THE LYRE WITH THE LYRE AND THE SOUND OF MELODY

WITH TRUMPETS AND THE SOUND OF THE HORN MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE BEFORE THE KING THE LORD

LET THE SEA ROAR AND ALL THAT FILLS IT; THE WORLD AND THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT

LET THE RIVERS CLAP THEIR HANDS; LET THE HILLS SING FOR JOY TOGETHER BEFORE THE LORD FOR HE COMES TO JUDGE THE EARTH

HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE PEOPLES WITH EQUITY

THE LORD REIGNS; LET THE PEOPLES TREMBLE

HE SITS ENTHRONED UPON THE CHERUBIM; LET THE EARTH QUAKE

THE LORD IS GREAT IN ZION; HE IS EXALTED OVER ALL THE PEOPLES

LET THEM PRAISE YOUR GREAT AND AWESOME NAME

HOLY IS HE

THE KING IN HIS MIGHT LOVES JUSTICE

YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED EQUITY; YOU HAVE EXECUTED JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN JACOB

EXALT THE LORD OUR GOD; WORSHIP AT HIS FOOTSTOOL

HOLY IS HE

MOSES AND AARON WERE AMONG HIS PRIESTS SAMUEL ALSO WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALLED UPON HIS NAME

THEY CALLED TO THE LORD AND HE ANSWERED THEM

IN THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD HE SPOKE TO THEM; THEY KEPT HIS TESTIMONIES AND THE STATUTE THAT HE GAVE THEM

O LORD OUR GOD YOU ANSWERED THEM; YOU WERE A FORGIVING GOD TO THEM BUT AN AVENGER OF THEIR WRONGDOINGS

EXALT THE LORD OUR GOD AND WORSHIP AT HIS HOLY MOUNTAIN; FOR THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY

MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE LORD ALL THE EARTH

SERVE THE LORD WITH GLADNESS

COME INTO HIS PRESENCE WITH SINGING

KNOW THAT THE LORD HE IS GOD

IT IS HE WHO MADE US AND WE ARE HIS; WE ARE HIS PEOPLE AND THE SHEEP OF HIS PASTURE

ENTER HIS GATES WITH THANKSGIVING AND HIS COURTS WITH PRAISE

GIVE THANKS TO HIM; BLESS HIS NAME

FOR THE LORD IS GOOD; HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER AND HIS FAITHFULNESS TO ALL GENERATIONS

I WILL SING OF STEADFAST LOVE AND JUSTICE; TO YOU O LORD I WILL MAKE MUSIC

I WILL PONDER THE WAY THAT IS BLAMELESS

OH WHEN WILL YOU COME TO ME

I WILL WALK WITH INTEGRITY OF HEART WITHIN MY HOUSE; I WILL NOT SET BEFORE MY EYES ANYTHING THAT IS WORTHLESS

I HATE THE WORK OF THOSE WHO FALL AWAY; IT SHALL NOT CLING TO ME

A PERVERSE HEART SHALL BE FAR FROM ME; I WILL KNOW NOTHING OF EVIL

WHOEVER SLANDERS HIS NEIGHBOR SECRETLY I WILL DESTROY

WHOEVER HAS A HAUGHTY LOOK AND AN ARROGANT HEART I WILL NOT ENDURE

I WILL LOOK WITH FAVOR ON THE FAITHFUL IN THE LAND THAT THEY MAY DWELL WITH ME; HE WHO WALKS IN THE WAY THAT IS BLAMELESS SHALL MINISTER TO ME

NO ONE WHO PRACTICES DECEIT SHALL DWELL IN MY HOUSE; NO ONE WHO UTTERS LIES SHALL CONTINUE BEFORE MY EYES

MORNING BY MORNING I WILL DESTROY ALL THE WICKED IN THE LAND CUTTING OFF ALL THE EVILDOERS FROM THE CITY OF THE LORD

HEAR MY PRAYER O LORD; LET MY CRY COME TO YOU

DO NOT HIDE YOUR FACE FROM ME IN THE DAY OF MY DISTRESS

INCLINE YOUR EAR TO ME; ANSWER ME SPEEDILY IN THE DAY WHEN I CALL

FOR MY DAYS PASS AWAY LIKE SMOKE AND MY BONES BURN LIKE A FURNACE

MY HEART IS STRUCK DOWN LIKE GRASS AND HAS WITHERED; I FORGET TO EAT MY BREAD

BECAUSE OF MY LOUD GROANING MY BONES CLING TO MY FLESH

I AM LIKE A DESERT OWL OF THE WILDERNESS LIKE AN OWL OF THE WASTE PLACES; I LIE AWAKE; I AM LIKE A LONELY SPARROW ON THE HOUSETOP

ALL THE DAY MY ENEMIES TAUNT ME; THOSE WHO DERIDE ME USE MY NAME FOR A CURSE

FOR I EAT ASHES LIKE BREAD AND MINGLE TEARS WITH MY DRINK BECAUSE OF YOUR INDIGNATION AND ANGER; FOR YOU HAVE TAKEN ME UP AND THROWN ME DOWN

MY DAYS ARE LIKE AN EVENING SHADOW; I WITHER AWAY LIKE GRASS

BUT YOU O LORD ARE ENTHRONED FOREVER; YOU ARE REMEMBERED THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS

YOU WILL ARISE AND HAVE PITY ON ZION; IT IS THE TIME TO FAVOR HER; THE APPOINTED TIME HAS COME

FOR YOUR SERVANTS HOLD HER STONES DEAR AND HAVE PITY ON HER DUST

NATIONS WILL FEAR THE NAME OF THE LORD AND ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WILL FEAR YOUR GLORY

FOR THE LORD BUILDS UP ZION; HE APPEARS IN HIS GLORY; HE REGARDS THE PRAYER OF THE DESTITUTE AND DOES NOT DESPISE THEIR PRAYER

LET THIS BE RECORDED FOR A GENERATION TO COME SO THAT A PEOPLE YET TO BE CREATED MAY PRAISE THE LORD THAT HE LOOKED DOWN FROM HIS HOLY HEIGHT; FROM HEAVEN THE LORD LOOKED AT THE EARTH TO HEAR THE GROANS OF THE PRISONERS TO SET FREE THOSE WHO WERE DOOMED TO DIE THAT THEY MAY DECLARE IN ZION THE NAME OF THE LORD AND IN JERUSALEM HIS PRAISE WHEN PEOPLES GATHER TOGETHER AND KINGDOMS TO WORSHIP THE LORD

HE HAS BROKEN MY STRENGTH IN MIDCOURSE; HE HAS SHORTENED MY DAYS

O MY GOD I SAY TAKE ME NOT AWAY IN THE MIDST OF MY DAYSYOU WHOSE YEARS ENDURE THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS

 OF OLD YOU LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

THEY WILL PERISH BUT YOU WILL REMAIN; THEY WILL ALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT

YOU WILL CHANGE THEM LIKE A ROBE AND THEY WILL PASS AWAY BUT YOU ARE THE SAME AND YOUR YEARS HAVE NO END

THE CHILDREN OF YOUR SERVANTS SHALL DWELL SECURE; THEIR OFFSPRING SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE YOU

BLESS THE LORD O MY SOUL AND ALL THAT IS WITHIN ME BLESS HIS HOLY NAME

BLESS THE LORD O MY SOUL AND FORGET NOT ALL HIS BENEFITS WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR INIQUITY WHO HEALS ALL YOUR DISEASES WHO REDEEMS YOUR LIFE FROM THE PIT WHO CROWNS YOU WITH STEADFAST LOVE AND MERCY WHO SATISFIES YOU WITH GOOD SO THAT YOUR YOUTH IS RENEWED LIKE THE EAGLE'S

THE LORD WORKS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL WHO ARE OPPRESSED

HE MADE KNOWN HIS WAYS TO MOSES HIS ACTS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THE LORD IS MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE

HE WILL NOT ALWAYS CHIDE NOR WILL HE KEEP HIS ANGER FOREVER

HE DOES NOT DEAL WITH US ACCORDING TO OUR SINS NOR REPAY US ACCORDING TO OUR INIQUITIES

FOR AS HIGH AS THE HEAVENS ARE ABOVE THE EARTH SO GREAT IS HIS STEADFAST LOVE TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; AS FAR AS THE EAST IS FROM THE WEST SO FAR DOES HE REMOVE OUR TRANSGRESSIONS FROM US

AS A FATHER SHOWS COMPASSION TO HIS CHILDREN SO THE LORD SHOWS COMPASSION TO THOSE WHO FEAR HIM

FOR HE KNOWS OUR FRAME; HE REMEMBERS THAT WE ARE DUST

AS FOR MAN HIS DAYS ARE LIKE GRASS; HE FLOURISHES LIKE A FLOWER OF THE FIELD; FOR THE WIND PASSES OVER IT AND IT IS GONE AND ITS PLACE KNOWS IT NO MORE

BUT THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD IS FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO THOSE WHO KEEP HIS COVENANT AND REMEMBER TO DO HIS COMMANDMENTS

THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE IN THE HEAVENS AND HIS KINGDOM RULES OVER ALL

BLESS THE LORD O YOU HIS ANGELS YOU MIGHTY ONES WHO DO HIS WORD OBEYING THE VOICE OF HIS WORD

BLESS THE LORD ALL HIS HOSTS HIS MINISTERS WHO DO HIS WILL

BLESS THE LORD ALL HIS WORKS IN ALL PLACES OF HIS DOMINION

BLESS THE LORD O MY SOUL

BLESS THE LORD O MY SOUL

O LORD MY GOD YOU ARE VERY GREAT

YOU ARE CLOTHED WITH SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY COVERING YOURSELF WITH LIGHT AS WITH A GARMENT STRETCHING OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A TENT

HE LAYS THE BEAMS OF HIS CHAMBERS ON THE WATERS; HE MAKES THE CLOUDS HIS CHARIOT; HE RIDES ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND; HE MAKES HIS MESSENGERS WINDS HIS MINISTERS A FLAMING FIRE

HE SET THE EARTH ON ITS FOUNDATIONS SO THAT IT SHOULD NEVER BE MOVED

YOU COVERED IT WITH THE DEEP AS WITH A GARMENT; THE WATERS STOOD ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS

AT YOUR REBUKE THEY FLED; AT THE SOUND OF YOUR THUNDER THEY TOOK TO FLIGHT

THE MOUNTAINS ROSE THE VALLEYS SANK DOWN TO THE PLACE THAT YOU APPOINTED FOR THEM

YOU SET A BOUNDARY THAT THEY MAY NOT PASS SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT AGAIN COVER THE EARTH

YOU MAKE SPRINGS GUSH FORTH IN THE VALLEYS; THEY FLOW BETWEEN THE HILLS; THEY GIVE DRINK TO EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD; THE WILD DONKEYS QUENCH THEIR THIRST

BESIDE THEM THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS DWELL; THEY SING AMONG THE BRANCHES

FROM YOUR LOFTY ABODE YOU WATER THE MOUNTAINS; THE EARTH IS SATISFIED WITH THE FRUIT OF YOUR WORK

YOU CAUSE THE GRASS TO GROW FOR THE LIVESTOCK AND PLANTS FOR MAN TO CULTIVATE THAT HE MAY BRING FORTH FOOD FROM THE EARTH AND WINE TO GLADDEN THE HEART OF MAN OIL TO MAKE HIS FACE SHINE AND BREAD TO STRENGTHEN MAN'S HEART

THE TREES OF THE LORD ARE WATERED ABUNDANTLY THE CEDARS OF LEBANON THAT HE PLANTED

IN THEM THE BIRDS BUILD THEIR NESTS; THE STORK HAS HER HOME IN THE FIR TREES

THE HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE FOR THE WILD GOATS; THE ROCKS ARE A REFUGE FOR THE ROCK BADGERS

HE MADE THE MOON TO MARK THE SEASONS; THE SUN KNOWS ITS TIME FOR SETTING

YOU MAKE DARKNESS AND IT IS NIGHT WHEN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST CREEP ABOUT

THE YOUNG LIONS ROAR FOR THEIR PREY SEEKING THEIR FOOD FROM GOD

WHEN THE SUN RISES THEY STEAL AWAY AND LIE DOWN IN THEIR DENS

MAN GOES OUT TO HIS WORK AND TO HIS LABOR UNTIL THE EVENING

O LORD HOW MANIFOLD ARE YOUR WORKS

IN WISDOM HAVE YOU MADE THEM ALL; THE EARTH IS FULL OF YOUR CREATURES

HERE IS THE SEA GREAT AND WIDE WHICH TEEMS WITH CREATURES INNUMERABLE LIVING THINGS BOTH SMALL AND GREAT

THERE GO THE SHIPS AND LEVIATHAN WHICH YOU FORMED TO PLAY IN IT

THESE ALL LOOK TO YOU TO GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD IN DUE SEASON

WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO THEM THEY GATHER IT UP; WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HAND THEY ARE FILLED WITH GOOD THINGS

WHEN YOU HIDE YOUR FACE THEY ARE DISMAYED; WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR BREATH THEY DIE AND RETURN TO THEIR DUST

WHEN YOU SEND FORTH YOUR SPIRIT THEY ARE CREATED AND YOU RENEW THE FACE OF THE GROUND

MAY THE GLORY OF THE LORD ENDURE FOREVER; MAY THE LORD REJOICE IN HIS WORKS WHO LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES WHO TOUCHES THE MOUNTAINS AND THEY SMOKE

I WILL SING TO THE LORD AS LONG AS I LIVE; I WILL SING PRAISE TO MY GOD WHILE I HAVE BEING

MAY MY MEDITATION BE PLEASING TO HIM FOR I REJOICE IN THE LORD

LET SINNERS BE CONSUMED FROM THE EARTH AND LET THE WICKED BE NO MORE

BLESS THE LORD O MY SOUL

PRAISE THE LORD

OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD; CALL UPON HIS NAME; MAKE KNOWN HIS DEEDS AMONG THE PEOPLES

SING TO HIM SING PRAISES TO HIM; TELL OF ALL HIS WONDROUS WORKS

GLORY IN HIS HOLY NAME; LET THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD REJOICE

SEEK THE LORD AND HIS STRENGTH; SEEK HIS PRESENCE CONTINUALLY

REMEMBER THE WONDROUS WORKS THAT HE HAS DONE HIS MIRACLES AND THE JUDGMENTS HE UTTERED O OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM HIS SERVANT CHILDREN OF JACOB HIS CHOSEN ONES

HE IS THE LORD OUR GOD; HIS JUDGMENTS ARE IN ALL THE EARTH

HE REMEMBERS HIS COVENANT FOREVER THE WORD THAT HE COMMANDED FOR A THOUSAND GENERATIONS THE COVENANT THAT HE MADE WITH ABRAHAM HIS SWORN PROMISE TO ISAAC WHICH HE CONFIRMED TO JACOB AS A STATUTE TO ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT SAYING TO YOU I WILL GIVE THE LAND OF CANAAN AS YOUR PORTION FOR AN INHERITANCE

 WHEN THEY WERE FEW IN NUMBER OF LITTLE ACCOUNT AND SOJOURNERS IN IT WANDERING FROM NATION TO NATION FROM ONE KINGDOM TO ANOTHER PEOPLE HE ALLOWED NO ONE TO OPPRESS THEM; HE REBUKED KINGS ON THEIR ACCOUNT SAYING TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED ONES DO MY PROPHETS NO HARM

 WHEN HE SUMMONED A FAMINE ON THE LAND AND BROKE ALL SUPPLY OF BREAD HE HAD SENT A MAN AHEAD OF THEM JOSEPH WHO WAS SOLD AS A SLAVE

HIS FEET WERE HURT WITH FETTERS; HIS NECK WAS PUT IN A COLLAR OF IRON; UNTIL WHAT HE HAD SAID CAME TO PASS THE WORD OF THE LORD TESTED HIM

THE KING SENT AND RELEASED HIM; THE RULER OF THE PEOPLES SET HIM FREE; HE MADE HIM LORD OF HIS HOUSE AND RULER OF ALL HIS POSSESSIONS TO BIND HIS PRINCES AT HIS PLEASURE AND TO TEACH HIS ELDERS WISDOM

THEN ISRAEL CAME TO EGYPT; JACOB SOJOURNED IN THE LAND OF HAM

AND THE LORD MADE HIS PEOPLE VERY FRUITFUL AND MADE THEM STRONGER THAN THEIR FOES

HE TURNED THEIR HEARTS TO HATE HIS PEOPLE TO DEAL CRAFTILY WITH HIS SERVANTS

HE SENT MOSES HIS SERVANT AND AARON WHOM HE HAD CHOSEN

THEY PERFORMED HIS SIGNS AMONG THEM AND MIRACLES IN THE LAND OF HAM

HE SENT DARKNESS AND MADE THE LAND DARK; THEY DID NOT REBEL AGAINST HIS WORDS

HE TURNED THEIR WATERS INTO BLOOD AND CAUSED THEIR FISH TO DIE

THEIR LAND SWARMED WITH FROGS EVEN IN THE CHAMBERS OF THEIR KINGS

HE SPOKE AND THERE CAME SWARMS OF FLIES AND GNATS THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY

HE GAVE THEM HAIL FOR RAIN AND FIERY LIGHTNING BOLTS THROUGH THEIR LAND

HE STRUCK DOWN THEIR VINES AND FIG TREES AND SHATTERED THE TREES OF THEIR COUNTRY

HE SPOKE AND THE LOCUSTS CAME YOUNG LOCUSTS WITHOUT NUMBER WHICH DEVOURED ALL THE VEGETATION IN THEIR LAND AND ATE UP THE FRUIT OF THEIR GROUND

HE STRUCK DOWN ALL THE FIRSTBORN IN THEIR LAND THE FIRSTFRUITS OF ALL THEIR STRENGTH

THEN HE BROUGHT OUT ISRAEL WITH SILVER AND GOLD AND THERE WAS NONE AMONG HIS TRIBES WHO STUMBLED

EGYPT WAS GLAD WHEN THEY DEPARTED FOR DREAD OF THEM HAD FALLEN UPON IT

HE SPREAD A CLOUD FOR A COVERING AND FIRE TO GIVE LIGHT BY NIGHT

THEY ASKED AND HE BROUGHT QUAIL AND GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN IN ABUNDANCE

HE OPENED THE ROCK AND WATER GUSHED OUT; IT FLOWED THROUGH THE DESERT LIKE A RIVER

FOR HE REMEMBERED HIS HOLY PROMISE AND ABRAHAM HIS SERVANT

SO HE BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE OUT WITH JOY HIS CHOSEN ONES WITH SINGING

AND HE GAVE THEM THE LANDS OF THE NATIONS AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE FRUIT OF THE PEOPLES' TOIL THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP HIS STATUTES AND OBSERVE HIS LAWS

PRAISE THE LORD

PRAISE THE LORD

OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

WHO CAN UTTER THE MIGHTY DEEDS OF THE LORD OR DECLARE ALL HIS PRAISE

BLESSED ARE THEY WHO OBSERVE JUSTICE WHO DO RIGHTEOUSNESS AT ALL TIMES

REMEMBER ME O LORD WHEN YOU SHOW FAVOR TO YOUR PEOPLE; HELP ME WHEN YOU SAVE THEM THAT I MAY LOOK UPON THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR CHOSEN ONES THAT I MAY REJOICE IN THE GLADNESS OF YOUR NATION THAT I MAY GLORY WITH YOUR INHERITANCE

BOTH WE AND OUR FATHERS HAVE SINNED; WE HAVE COMMITTED INIQUITY; WE HAVE DONE WICKEDNESS

OUR FATHERS WHEN THEY WERE IN EGYPT DID NOT CONSIDER YOUR WONDROUS WORKS; THEY DID NOT REMEMBER THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE BUT REBELLED BY THE SEA AT THE RED SEA

YET HE SAVED THEM FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE THAT HE MIGHT MAKE KNOWN HIS MIGHTY POWER

HE REBUKED THE RED SEA AND IT BECAME DRY AND HE LED THEM THROUGH THE DEEP AS THROUGH A DESERT

SO HE SAVED THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE FOE AND REDEEMED THEM FROM THE POWER OF THE ENEMY

AND THE WATERS COVERED THEIR ADVERSARIES; NOT ONE OF THEM WAS LEFT

THEN THEY BELIEVED HIS WORDS; THEY SANG HIS PRAISE

BUT THEY SOON FORGOT HIS WORKS; THEY DID NOT WAIT FOR HIS COUNSEL

BUT THEY HAD A WANTON CRAVING IN THE WILDERNESS AND PUT GOD TO THE TEST IN THE DESERT; HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY ASKED BUT SENT A WASTING DISEASE AMONG THEM

WHEN MEN IN THE CAMP WERE JEALOUS OF MOSES AND AARON THE HOLY ONE OF THE LORD THE EARTH OPENED AND SWALLOWED UP DATHAN AND COVERED THE COMPANY OF ABIRAM

FIRE ALSO BROKE OUT IN THEIR COMPANY; THE FLAME BURNED UP THE WICKED

THEY MADE A CALF IN HOREB AND WORSHIPED A METAL IMAGE

THEY EXCHANGED THE GLORY OF GOD FOR THE IMAGE OF AN OX THAT EATS GRASS

THEY FORGOT GOD THEIR SAVIOR WHO HAD DONE GREAT THINGS IN EGYPT WONDROUS WORKS IN THE LAND OF HAM AND AWESOME DEEDS BY THE RED SEA

THEREFORE HE SAID HE WOULD DESTROY THEMHAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN ONE STOOD IN THE BREACH BEFORE HIM TO TURN AWAY HIS WRATH FROM DESTROYING THEM

THEN THEY DESPISED THE PLEASANT LAND HAVING NO FAITH IN HIS PROMISE

THEY MURMURED IN THEIR TENTS AND DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD

THEREFORE HE RAISED HIS HAND AND SWORE TO THEM THAT HE WOULD MAKE THEM FALL IN THE WILDERNESS AND WOULD MAKE THEIR OFFSPRING FALL AMONG THE NATIONS SCATTERING THEM AMONG THE LANDS

THEN THEY YOKED THEMSELVES TO THE BAAL OF PEOR AND ATE SACRIFICES OFFERED TO THE DEAD; THEY PROVOKED THE LORD TO ANGER WITH THEIR DEEDS AND A PLAGUE BROKE OUT AMONG THEM

THEN PHINEHAS STOOD UP AND INTERVENED AND THE PLAGUE WAS STAYED

AND THAT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION FOREVER

THEY ANGERED HIM AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH AND IT WENT ILL WITH MOSES ON THEIR ACCOUNT FOR THEY MADE HIS SPIRIT BITTER AND HE SPOKE RASHLY WITH HIS LIPS

THEY DID NOT DESTROY THE PEOPLES AS THE LORD COMMANDED THEM BUT THEY MIXED WITH THE NATIONS AND LEARNED TO DO AS THEY DID

THEY SERVED THEIR IDOLS WHICH BECAME A SNARE TO THEM

THEY SACRIFICED THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THE DEMONS; THEY POURED OUT INNOCENT BLOOD THE BLOOD OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHOM THEY SACRIFICED TO THE IDOLS OF CANAAN AND THE LAND WAS POLLUTED WITH BLOOD

THUS THEY BECAME UNCLEAN BY THEIR ACTS AND PLAYED THE WHORE IN THEIR DEEDS

THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AND HE ABHORRED HIS HERITAGE; HE GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE NATIONS SO THAT THOSE WHO HATED THEM RULED OVER THEM

THEIR ENEMIES OPPRESSED THEM AND THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO SUBJECTION UNDER THEIR POWER

MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM BUT THEY WERE REBELLIOUS IN THEIR PURPOSES AND WERE BROUGHT LOW THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY

NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED UPON THEIR DISTRESS WHEN HE HEARD THEIR CRY

FOR THEIR SAKE HE REMEMBERED HIS COVENANT AND RELENTED ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS STEADFAST LOVE

HE CAUSED THEM TO BE PITIED BY ALL THOSE WHO HELD THEM CAPTIVE

SAVE US O LORD OUR GOD AND GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS THAT WE MAY GIVE THANKS TO YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE

BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING

AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY AMEN

 PRAISE THE LORD

OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

LET THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD SAY SO WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED FROM TROUBLE AND GATHERED IN FROM THE LANDS FROM THE EAST AND FROM THE WEST FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE SOUTH

SOME WANDERED IN DESERT WASTES FINDING NO WAY TO A CITY TO DWELL IN; HUNGRY AND THIRSTY THEIR SOUL FAINTED WITHIN THEM

THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR TROUBLE AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DISTRESS

HE LED THEM BY A STRAIGHT WAY TILL THEY REACHED A CITY TO DWELL IN

LET THEM THANK THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOR HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN

FOR HE SATISFIES THE LONGING SOUL AND THE HUNGRY SOUL HE FILLS WITH GOOD THINGS

SOME SAT IN DARKNESS AND IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH PRISONERS IN AFFLICTION AND IN IRONS FOR THEY HAD REBELLED AGAINST THE WORDS OF GOD AND SPURNED THE COUNSEL OF THE MOST HIGH

SO HE BOWED THEIR HEARTS DOWN WITH HARD LABOR; THEY FELL DOWN WITH NONE TO HELP

THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR TROUBLE AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DISTRESS

HE BROUGHT THEM OUT OF DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH AND BURST THEIR BONDS APART

LET THEM THANK THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOR HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN

FOR HE SHATTERS THE DOORS OF BRONZE AND CUTS IN TWO THE BARS OF IRON

SOME WERE FOOLS THROUGH THEIR SINFUL WAYS AND BECAUSE OF THEIR INIQUITIES SUFFERED AFFLICTION; THEY LOATHED ANY KIND OF FOOD AND THEY DREW NEAR TO THE GATES OF DEATH

THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR TROUBLE AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DISTRESS

HE SENT OUT HIS WORD AND HEALED THEM AND DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DESTRUCTION

LET THEM THANK THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOR HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN

AND LET THEM OFFER SACRIFICES OF THANKSGIVING AND TELL OF HIS DEEDS IN SONGS OF JOY

SOME WENT DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS DOING BUSINESS ON THE GREAT WATERS; THEY SAW THE DEEDS OF THE LORD HIS WONDROUS WORKS IN THE DEEP

FOR HE COMMANDED AND RAISED THE STORMY WIND WHICH LIFTED UP THE WAVES OF THE SEA

THEY MOUNTED UP TO HEAVEN; THEY WENT DOWN TO THE DEPTHS; THEIR COURAGE MELTED AWAY IN THEIR EVIL PLIGHT; THEY REELED AND STAGGERED LIKE DRUNKEN MEN AND WERE AT THEIR WITS' END

THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR TROUBLE AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR DISTRESS

HE MADE THE STORM BE STILL AND THE WAVES OF THE SEA WERE HUSHED

THEN THEY WERE GLAD THAT THE WATERS WERE QUIET AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR DESIRED HAVEN

LET THEM THANK THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOR HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN

LET THEM EXTOL HIM IN THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE AND PRAISE HIM IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE ELDERS

HE TURNS RIVERS INTO A DESERT SPRINGS OF WATER INTO THIRSTY GROUND A FRUITFUL LAND INTO A SALTY WASTE BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF ITS INHABITANTS

HE TURNS A DESERT INTO POOLS OF WATER A PARCHED LAND INTO SPRINGS OF WATER

AND THERE HE LETS THE HUNGRY DWELL AND THEY ESTABLISH A CITY TO LIVE IN; THEY SOW FIELDS AND PLANT VINEYARDS AND GET A FRUITFUL YIELD

BY HIS BLESSING THEY MULTIPLY GREATLY AND HE DOES NOT LET THEIR LIVESTOCK DIMINISH

WHEN THEY ARE DIMINISHED AND BROUGHT LOW THROUGH OPPRESSION EVIL AND SORROW HE POURS CONTEMPT ON PRINCES AND MAKES THEM WANDER IN TRACKLESS WASTES; BUT HE RAISES UP THE NEEDY OUT OF AFFLICTION AND MAKES THEIR FAMILIES LIKE FLOCKS

THE UPRIGHT SEE IT AND ARE GLAD AND ALL WICKEDNESS SHUTS ITS MOUTH

WHOEVER IS WISE LET HIM ATTEND TO THESE THINGS; LET THEM CONSIDER THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD

MY HEART IS STEADFAST O GOD

I WILL SING AND MAKE MELODY WITH ALL MY BEING

AWAKE O HARP AND LYRE

I WILL AWAKE THE DAWN

I WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU O LORD AMONG THE PEOPLES; I WILL SING PRAISES TO YOU AMONG THE NATIONS

FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS GREAT ABOVE THE HEAVENS; YOUR FAITHFULNESS REACHES TO THE CLOUDS

BE EXALTED O GOD ABOVE THE HEAVENS

LET YOUR GLORY BE OVER ALL THE EARTH

THAT YOUR BELOVED ONES MAY BE DELIVERED GIVE SALVATION BY YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ANSWER ME

GOD HAS PROMISED IN HIS HOLINESS WITH EXULTATION I WILL DIVIDE UP SHECHEM AND PORTION OUT THE VALLEY OF SUCCOTH

GILEAD IS MINE; MANASSEH IS MINE; EPHRAIM IS MY HELMET JUDAH MY SCEPTER

MOAB IS MY WASHBASIN; UPON EDOM I CAST MY SHOE; OVER PHILISTIA I SHOUT IN TRIUMPH

 WHO WILL BRING ME TO THE FORTIFIED CITY

WHO WILL LEAD ME TO EDOM

HAVE YOU NOT REJECTED US O GOD

YOU DO NOT GO OUT O GOD WITH OUR ARMIES

OH GRANT US HELP AGAINST THE FOE FOR VAIN IS THE SALVATION OF MAN

WITH GOD WE SHALL DO VALIANTLY; IT IS HE WHO WILL TREAD DOWN OUR FOES

BE NOT SILENT O GOD OF MY PRAISE

FOR WICKED AND DECEITFUL MOUTHS ARE OPENED AGAINST ME SPEAKING AGAINST ME WITH LYING TONGUES

THEY ENCIRCLE ME WITH WORDS OF HATE AND ATTACK ME WITHOUT CAUSE

IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY ACCUSE ME BUT I GIVE MYSELF TO PRAYER

SO THEY REWARD ME EVIL FOR GOOD AND HATRED FOR MY LOVE

APPOINT A WICKED MAN AGAINST HIM; LET AN ACCUSER STAND AT HIS RIGHT HAND

WHEN HE IS TRIED LET HIM COME FORTH GUILTY; LET HIS PRAYER BE COUNTED AS SIN

MAY HIS DAYS BE FEW; MAY ANOTHER TAKE HIS OFFICE

MAY HIS CHILDREN BE FATHERLESS AND HIS WIFE A WIDOW

MAY HIS CHILDREN WANDER ABOUT AND BEG SEEKING FOOD FAR FROM THE RUINS THEY INHABIT

MAY THE CREDITOR SEIZE ALL THAT HE HAS; MAY STRANGERS PLUNDER THE FRUITS OF HIS TOIL

LET THERE BE NONE TO EXTEND KINDNESS TO HIM NOR ANY TO PITY HIS FATHERLESS CHILDREN

MAY HIS POSTERITY BE CUT OFF; MAY HIS NAME BE BLOTTED OUT IN THE SECOND GENERATION

MAY THE INIQUITY OF HIS FATHERS BE REMEMBERED BEFORE THE LORD AND LET NOT THE SIN OF HIS MOTHER BE BLOTTED OUT

LET THEM BE BEFORE THE LORD CONTINUALLY THAT HE MAY CUT OFF THE MEMORY OF THEM FROM THE EARTH

FOR HE DID NOT REMEMBER TO SHOW KINDNESS BUT PURSUED THE POOR AND NEEDY AND THE BROKENHEARTED TO PUT THEM TO DEATH

HE LOVED TO CURSE; LET CURSES COME UPON HIM

HE DID NOT DELIGHT IN BLESSING; MAY IT BE FAR FROM HIM

HE CLOTHED HIMSELF WITH CURSING AS HIS COAT; MAY IT SOAK INTO HIS BODY LIKE WATER LIKE OIL INTO HIS BONES

MAY IT BE LIKE A GARMENT THAT HE WRAPS AROUND HIM LIKE A BELT THAT HE PUTS ON EVERY DAY

MAY THIS BE THE REWARD OF MY ACCUSERS FROM THE LORD OF THOSE WHO SPEAK EVIL AGAINST MY LIFE

BUT YOU O GOD MY LORD DEAL ON MY BEHALF FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE; BECAUSE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS GOOD DELIVER ME

FOR I AM POOR AND NEEDY AND MY HEART IS STRICKEN WITHIN ME

I AM GONE LIKE A SHADOW AT EVENING; I AM SHAKEN OFF LIKE A LOCUST

MY KNEES ARE WEAK THROUGH FASTING; MY BODY HAS BECOME GAUNT WITH NO FAT

I AM AN OBJECT OF SCORN TO MY ACCUSERS; WHEN THEY SEE ME THEY WAG THEIR HEADS

HELP ME O LORD MY GOD

SAVE ME ACCORDING TO YOUR STEADFAST LOVE

LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS IS YOUR HAND; YOU O LORD HAVE DONE IT

LET THEM CURSE BUT YOU WILL BLESS

THEY ARISE AND ARE PUT TO SHAME BUT YOUR SERVANT WILL BE GLAD

MAY MY ACCUSERS BE CLOTHED WITH DISHONOR; MAY THEY BE WRAPPED IN THEIR OWN SHAME AS IN A CLOAK

WITH MY MOUTH I WILL GIVE GREAT THANKS TO THE LORD; I WILL PRAISE HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE THRONG

FOR HE STANDS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE NEEDY TO SAVE HIM FROM THOSE WHO CONDEMN HIS SOUL TO DEATH

THE LORD SAYS TO MY LORD SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES YOUR FOOTSTOOL

 THE LORD SENDS FORTH FROM ZION YOUR MIGHTY SCEPTER

RULE IN THE MIDST OF YOUR ENEMIES

YOUR PEOPLE WILL OFFER THEMSELVES FREELY ON THE DAY OF YOUR POWER IN HOLY GARMENTS; FROM THE WOMB OF THE MORNING THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH WILL BE YOURS

THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK

 THE LORD IS AT YOUR RIGHT HAND; HE WILL SHATTER KINGS ON THE DAY OF HIS WRATH

HE WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENT AMONG THE NATIONS FILLING THEM WITH CORPSES; HE WILL SHATTER CHIEFS OVER THE WIDE EARTH

HE WILL DRINK FROM THE BROOK BY THE WAY; THEREFORE HE WILL LIFT UP HIS HEAD

PRAISE THE LORD

I WILL GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD WITH MY WHOLE HEART IN THE COMPANY OF THE UPRIGHT IN THE CONGREGATION

GREAT ARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD STUDIED BY ALL WHO DELIGHT IN THEM

FULL OF SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY IS HIS WORK AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER

HE HAS CAUSED HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO BE REMEMBERED; THE LORD IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL

HE PROVIDES FOOD FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; HE REMEMBERS HIS COVENANT FOREVER

HE HAS SHOWN HIS PEOPLE THE POWER OF HIS WORKS IN GIVING THEM THE INHERITANCE OF THE NATIONS

THE WORKS OF HIS HANDS ARE FAITHFUL AND JUST; ALL HIS PRECEPTS ARE TRUSTWORTHY; THEY ARE ESTABLISHED FOREVER AND EVER TO BE PERFORMED WITH FAITHFULNESS AND UPRIGHTNESS

HE SENT REDEMPTION TO HIS PEOPLE; HE HAS COMMANDED HIS COVENANT FOREVER

HOLY AND AWESOME IS HIS NAME

THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM; ALL THOSE WHO PRACTICE IT HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING

HIS PRAISE ENDURES FOREVER

PRAISE THE LORD

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO FEARS THE LORD WHO GREATLY DELIGHTS IN HIS COMMANDMENTS

HIS OFFSPRING WILL BE MIGHTY IN THE LAND; THE GENERATION OF THE UPRIGHT WILL BE BLESSED

WEALTH AND RICHES ARE IN HIS HOUSE AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER

LIGHT DAWNS IN THE DARKNESS FOR THE UPRIGHT; HE IS GRACIOUS MERCIFUL AND RIGHTEOUS

IT IS WELL WITH THE MAN WHO DEALS GENEROUSLY AND LENDS; WHO CONDUCTS HIS AFFAIRS WITH JUSTICE

FOR THE RIGHTEOUS WILL NEVER BE MOVED; HE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER

HE IS NOT AFRAID OF BAD NEWS; HIS HEART IS FIRM TRUSTING IN THE LORD

HIS HEART IS STEADY; HE WILL NOT BE AFRAID UNTIL HE LOOKS IN TRIUMPH ON HIS ADVERSARIES

HE HAS DISTRIBUTED FREELY; HE HAS GIVEN TO THE POOR; HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER; HIS HORN IS EXALTED IN HONOR

THE WICKED MAN SEES IT AND IS ANGRY; HE GNASHES HIS TEETH AND MELTS AWAY; THE DESIRE OF THE WICKED WILL PERISH

PRAISE THE LORD

PRAISE O SERVANTS OF THE LORD PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD

BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING THE NAME OF THE LORD IS TO BE PRAISED

THE LORD IS HIGH ABOVE ALL NATIONS AND HIS GLORY ABOVE THE HEAVENS

WHO IS LIKE THE LORD OUR GOD WHO IS SEATED ON HIGH WHO LOOKS FAR DOWN ON THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH

HE RAISES THE POOR FROM THE DUST AND LIFTS THE NEEDY FROM THE ASH HEAP TO MAKE THEM SIT WITH PRINCES WITH THE PRINCES OF HIS PEOPLE

HE GIVES THE BARREN WOMAN A HOME MAKING HER THE JOYOUS MOTHER OF CHILDREN

PRAISE THE LORD

WHEN ISRAEL WENT OUT FROM EGYPT THE HOUSE OF JACOB FROM A PEOPLE OF STRANGE LANGUAGE JUDAH BECAME HIS SANCTUARY ISRAEL HIS DOMINION

THE SEA LOOKED AND FLED; JORDAN TURNED BACK

THE MOUNTAINS SKIPPED LIKE RAMS THE HILLS LIKE LAMBS

WHAT AILS YOU O SEA THAT YOU FLEE

O JORDAN THAT YOU TURN BACK

O MOUNTAINS THAT YOU SKIP LIKE RAMS

O HILLS LIKE LAMBS

TREMBLE O EARTH AT THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AT THE PRESENCE OF THE GOD OF JACOB WHO TURNS THE ROCK INTO A POOL OF WATER THE FLINT INTO A SPRING OF WATER

NOT TO US O LORD NOT TO US BUT TO YOUR NAME GIVE GLORY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS

WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY WHERE IS THEIR GOD

 OUR GOD IS IN THE HEAVENS; HE DOES ALL THAT HE PLEASES

THEIR IDOLS ARE SILVER AND GOLD THE WORK OF HUMAN HANDS

THEY HAVE MOUTHS BUT DO NOT SPEAK; EYES BUT DO NOT SEE

THEY HAVE EARS BUT DO NOT HEAR; NOSES BUT DO NOT SMELL

THEY HAVE HANDS BUT DO NOT FEEL; FEET BUT DO NOT WALK; AND THEY DO NOT MAKE A SOUND IN THEIR THROAT

THOSE WHO MAKE THEM BECOME LIKE THEM; SO DO ALL WHO TRUST IN THEM

O ISRAEL TRUST IN THE LORD

A WARRIOR'S SHARP ARROWS WITH GLOWING COALS OF THE BROOM TREE

WOE TO ME THAT I SOJOURN IN MESHECH THAT I DWELL AMONG THE TENTS OF KEDAR

TOO LONG HAVE I HAD MY DWELLING AMONG THOSE WHO HATE PEACE

I AM FOR PEACE BUT WHEN I SPEAK THEY ARE FOR WAR

I LIFT UP MY EYES TO THE HILLS

MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH

HE WILL NOT LET YOUR FOOT BE MOVED; HE WHO KEEPS YOU WILL NOT SLUMBER

THE LORD WILL KEEP YOUR GOING OUT AND YOUR COMING IN FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

I WAS GLAD WHEN THEY SAID TO ME LET US GO TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 OUR FEET HAVE BEEN STANDING WITHIN YOUR GATES O JERUSALEM

JERUSALEMBUILT AS A CITY THAT IS BOUND FIRMLY TOGETHER TO WHICH THE TRIBES GO UP THE TRIBES OF THE LORD AS WAS DECREED FOR ISRAEL TO GIVE THANKS TO THE NAME OF THE LORD

THERE THRONES FOR JUDGMENT WERE SET THE THRONES OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID

PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM

MAY THEY BE SECURE WHO LOVE YOU

PEACE BE WITHIN YOUR WALLS AND SECURITY WITHIN YOUR TOWERS

 FOR MY BROTHERS AND COMPANIONS' SAKE I WILL SAY PEACE BE WITHIN YOU

 FOR THE SAKE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OUR GOD I WILL SEEK YOUR GOOD

TO YOU I LIFT UP MY EYES O YOU WHO ARE ENTHRONED IN THE HEAVENS

BEHOLD AS THE EYES OF SERVANTS LOOK TO THE HAND OF THEIR MASTER AS THE EYES OF A MAIDSERVANT TO THE HAND OF HER MISTRESS SO OUR EYES LOOK TO THE LORD OUR GOD TILL HE HAS MERCY UPON US

HAVE MERCY UPON US O LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US FOR WE HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF CONTEMPT

OUR SOUL HAS HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THE SCORN OF THOSE WHO ARE AT EASE OF THE CONTEMPT OF THE PROUD

IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THE LORD WHO WAS ON OUR SIDELET ISRAEL NOW SAY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THE LORD WHO WAS ON OUR SIDE WHEN PEOPLE ROSE UP AGAINST US THEN THEY WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED US UP ALIVE WHEN THEIR ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST US; THEN THE FLOOD WOULD HAVE SWEPT US AWAY THE TORRENT WOULD HAVE GONE OVER US; THEN OVER US WOULD HAVE GONE THE RAGING WATERS

BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO HAS NOT GIVEN US AS PREY TO THEIR TEETH

WE HAVE ESCAPED LIKE A BIRD FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLERS; THE SNARE IS BROKEN AND WE HAVE ESCAPED

OUR HELP IS IN THE NAME OF THE LORD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH

THOSE WHO TRUST IN THE LORD ARE LIKE MOUNT ZION WHICH CANNOT BE MOVED BUT ABIDES FOREVER

AS THE MOUNTAINS SURROUND JERUSALEM SO THE LORD SURROUNDS HIS PEOPLE FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

FOR THE SCEPTER OF WICKEDNESS SHALL NOT REST ON THE LAND ALLOTTED TO THE RIGHTEOUS LEST THE RIGHTEOUS STRETCH OUT THEIR HANDS TO DO WRONG

DO GOOD O LORD TO THOSE WHO ARE GOOD AND TO THOSE WHO ARE UPRIGHT IN THEIR HEARTS

BUT THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE TO THEIR CROOKED WAYS THE LORD WILL LEAD AWAY WITH EVILDOERS

PEACE BE UPON ISRAEL

WHEN THE LORD RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF ZION WE WERE LIKE THOSE WHO DREAM

THEN OUR MOUTH WAS FILLED WITH LAUGHTER AND OUR TONGUE WITH SHOUTS OF JOY; THEN THEY SAID AMONG THE NATIONS THE LORD HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THEM

 THE LORD HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR US; WE ARE GLAD

RESTORE OUR FORTUNES O LORD LIKE STREAMS IN THE NEGEB

THOSE WHO SOW IN TEARS SHALL REAP WITH SHOUTS OF JOY

HE WHO GOES OUT WEEPING BEARING THE SEED FOR SOWING SHALL COME HOME WITH SHOUTS OF JOY BRINGING HIS SHEAVES WITH HIM

UNLESS THE LORD BUILDS THE HOUSE THOSE WHO BUILD IT LABOR IN VAIN

UNLESS THE LORD WATCHES OVER THE CITY THE WATCHMAN STAYS AWAKE IN VAIN

IT IS IN VAIN THAT YOU RISE UP EARLY AND GO LATE TO REST EATING THE BREAD OF ANXIOUS TOIL; FOR HE GIVES TO HIS BELOVED SLEEP

BEHOLD CHILDREN ARE A HERITAGE FROM THE LORD THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB A REWARD

LIKE ARROWS IN THE HAND OF A WARRIOR ARE THE CHILDREN OF ONE'S YOUTH

BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO FILLS HIS QUIVER WITH THEM

HE SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME WHEN HE SPEAKS WITH HIS ENEMIES IN THE GATE

BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO FEARS THE LORD WHO WALKS IN HIS WAYS

YOU SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE LABOR OF YOUR HANDS; YOU SHALL BE BLESSED AND IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU

YOUR WIFE WILL BE LIKE A FRUITFUL VINE WITHIN YOUR HOUSE; YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE LIKE OLIVE SHOOTS AROUND YOUR TABLE

BEHOLD THUS SHALL THE MAN BE BLESSED WHO FEARS THE LORD

THE LORD BLESS YOU FROM ZION

MAY YOU SEE THE PROSPERITY OF JERUSALEM ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE

MAY YOU SEE YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN

PEACE BE UPON ISRAEL

GREATLY HAVE THEY AFFLICTED ME FROM MY YOUTHLET ISRAEL NOW SAY GREATLY HAVE THEY AFFLICTED ME FROM MY YOUTH YET THEY HAVE NOT PREVAILED AGAINST ME

THE PLOWERS PLOWED UPON MY BACK; THEY MADE LONG THEIR FURROWS

 THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS; HE HAS CUT THE CORDS OF THE WICKED

MAY ALL WHO HATE ZION BE PUT TO SHAME AND TURNED BACKWARD

LET THEM BE LIKE THE GRASS ON THE HOUSETOPS WHICH WITHERS BEFORE IT GROWS UP WITH WHICH THE REAPER DOES NOT FILL HIS HAND NOR THE BINDER OF SHEAVES HIS ARMS NOR DO THOSE WHO PASS BY SAY THE BLESSING OF THE LORD BE UPON YOU

WE BLESS YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

OUT OF THE DEPTHS I CRY TO YOU O LORD

O LORD HEAR MY VOICE

LET YOUR EARS BE ATTENTIVE TO THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY

IF YOU O LORD SHOULD MARK INIQUITIES O LORD WHO COULD STAND

BUT WITH YOU THERE IS FORGIVENESS THAT YOU MAY BE FEARED

I WAIT FOR THE LORD MY SOUL WAITS AND IN HIS WORD I HOPE; MY SOUL WAITS FOR THE LORD MORE THAN WATCHMEN FOR THE MORNING MORE THAN WATCHMEN FOR THE MORNING

O ISRAEL HOPE IN THE LORD

FOR WITH THE LORD THERE IS STEADFAST LOVE AND WITH HIM IS PLENTIFUL REDEMPTION

AND HE WILL REDEEM ISRAEL FROM ALL HIS INIQUITIES

O LORD MY HEART IS NOT LIFTED UP; MY EYES ARE NOT RAISED TOO HIGH; I DO NOT OCCUPY MYSELF WITH THINGS TOO GREAT AND TOO MARVELOUS FOR ME

BUT I HAVE CALMED AND QUIETED MY SOUL LIKE A WEANED CHILD WITH ITS MOTHER; LIKE A WEANED CHILD IS MY SOUL WITHIN ME

O ISRAEL HOPE IN THE LORD FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVERMORE

REMEMBER O LORD IN DAVID'S FAVOR ALL THE HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED HOW HE SWORE TO THE LORD AND VOWED TO THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB I WILL NOT ENTER MY HOUSE OR GET INTO MY BED I WILL NOT GIVE SLEEP TO MY EYES OR SLUMBER TO MY EYELIDS UNTIL I FIND A PLACE FOR THE LORD A DWELLING PLACE FOR THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB

FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID DO NOT TURN AWAY THE FACE OF YOUR ANOINTED ONE

THE LORD SWORE TO DAVID A SURE OATH FROM WHICH HE WILL NOT TURN BACK ONE OF THE SONS OF YOUR BODY I WILL SET ON YOUR THRONE

IF YOUR SONS KEEP MY COVENANT AND MY TESTIMONIES THAT I SHALL TEACH THEM THEIR SONS ALSO FOREVER SHALL SIT ON YOUR THRONE

 FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN ZION; HE HAS DESIRED IT FOR HIS DWELLING PLACE THIS IS MY RESTING PLACE FOREVER; HERE I WILL DWELL FOR I HAVE DESIRED IT

HIS ENEMIES I WILL CLOTHE WITH SHAME BUT ON HIM HIS CROWN WILL SHINE

BEHOLD HOW GOOD AND PLEASANT IT IS WHEN BROTHERS DWELL IN UNITY

IT IS LIKE THE PRECIOUS OIL ON THE HEAD RUNNING DOWN ON THE BEARD ON THE BEARD OF AARON RUNNING DOWN ON THE COLLAR OF HIS ROBES

IT IS LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON WHICH FALLS ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ZION

FOR THERE THE LORD HAS COMMANDED THE BLESSING LIFE FOREVERMORE

FOR I KNOW THAT THE LORD IS GREAT AND THAT OUR LORD IS ABOVE ALL GODS

WHATEVER THE LORD PLEASES HE DOES IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH IN THE SEAS AND ALL DEEPS

HE IT IS WHO MAKES THE CLOUDS RISE AT THE END OF THE EARTH WHO MAKES LIGHTNINGS FOR THE RAIN AND BRINGS FORTH THE WIND FROM HIS STOREHOUSES

HE IT WAS WHO STRUCK DOWN THE FIRSTBORN OF EGYPT BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST; WHO IN YOUR MIDST O EGYPT SENT SIGNS AND WONDERS AGAINST PHARAOH AND ALL HIS SERVANTS; WHO STRUCK DOWN MANY NATIONS AND KILLED MIGHTY KINGS SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES AND OG KING OF BASHAN AND ALL THE KINGDOMS OF CANAAN AND GAVE THEIR LAND AS A HERITAGE A HERITAGE TO HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

YOUR NAME O LORD ENDURES FOREVER YOUR RENOWN O LORD THROUGHOUT ALL AGES

FOR THE LORD WILL VINDICATE HIS PEOPLE AND HAVE COMPASSION ON HIS SERVANTS

THE IDOLS OF THE NATIONS ARE SILVER AND GOLD THE WORK OF HUMAN HANDS

THEY HAVE MOUTHS BUT DO NOT SPEAK; THEY HAVE EYES BUT DO NOT SEE; THEY HAVE EARS BUT DO NOT HEAR NOR IS THERE ANY BREATH IN THEIR MOUTHS

THOSE WHO MAKE THEM BECOME LIKE THEM SO DO ALL WHO TRUST IN THEM

BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHEN WE REMEMBERED ZION

ON THE WILLOWS THERE WE HUNG UP OUR LYRES

FOR THERE OUR CAPTORS REQUIRED OF US SONGS AND OUR TORMENTORS MIRTH SAYING SING US ONE OF THE SONGS OF ZION

 HOW SHALL WE SING THE LORD'S SONG IN A FOREIGN LAND

IF I FORGET YOU O JERUSALEM LET MY RIGHT HAND FORGET ITS SKILL

LET MY TONGUE STICK TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH IF I DO NOT REMEMBER YOU IF I DO NOT SET JERUSALEM ABOVE MY HIGHEST JOY

REMEMBER O LORD AGAINST THE EDOMITES THE DAY OF JERUSALEM HOW THEY SAID LAY IT BARE LAY IT BARE DOWN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS

 O DAUGHTER OF BABYLON DOOMED TO BE DESTROYED BLESSED SHALL HE BE WHO REPAYS YOU WITH WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO US

BLESSED SHALL HE BE WHO TAKES YOUR LITTLE ONES AND DASHES THEM AGAINST THE ROCK

I GIVE YOU THANKS O LORD WITH MY WHOLE HEART; BEFORE THE GODS I SING YOUR PRAISE; I BOW DOWN TOWARD YOUR HOLY TEMPLE AND GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS FOR YOU HAVE EXALTED ABOVE ALL THINGS YOUR NAME AND YOUR WORD

ON THE DAY I CALLED YOU ANSWERED ME; MY STRENGTH OF SOUL YOU INCREASED

ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SHALL GIVE YOU THANKS O LORD FOR THEY HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH AND THEY SHALL SING OF THE WAYS OF THE LORD FOR GREAT IS THE GLORY OF THE LORD

FOR THOUGH THE LORD IS HIGH HE REGARDS THE LOWLY BUT THE HAUGHTY HE KNOWS FROM AFAR

THOUGH I WALK IN THE MIDST OF TROUBLE YOU PRESERVE MY LIFE; YOU STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND AGAINST THE WRATH OF MY ENEMIES AND YOUR RIGHT HAND DELIVERS ME

THE LORD WILL FULFILL HIS PURPOSE FOR ME; YOUR STEADFAST LOVE O LORD ENDURES FOREVER

DO NOT FORSAKE THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

O LORD YOU HAVE SEARCHED ME AND KNOWN ME

YOU KNOW WHEN I SIT DOWN AND WHEN I RISE UP; YOU DISCERN MY THOUGHTS FROM AFAR

YOU SEARCH OUT MY PATH AND MY LYING DOWN AND ARE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL MY WAYS

EVEN BEFORE A WORD IS ON MY TONGUE BEHOLD O LORD YOU KNOW IT ALTOGETHER

YOU HEM ME IN BEHIND AND BEFORE AND LAY YOUR HAND UPON ME

SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS TOO WONDERFUL FOR ME; IT IS HIGH; I CANNOT ATTAIN IT

WHERE SHALL I GO FROM YOUR SPIRIT

OR WHERE SHALL I FLEE FROM YOUR PRESENCE

IF I ASCEND TO HEAVEN YOU ARE THERE

IF I MAKE MY BED IN SHEOL YOU ARE THERE

IF I TAKE THE WINGS OF THE MORNING AND DWELL IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE SEA EVEN THERE YOUR HAND SHALL LEAD ME AND YOUR RIGHT HAND SHALL HOLD ME

IF I SAY SURELY THE DARKNESS SHALL COVER ME AND THE LIGHT ABOUT ME BE NIGHT EVEN THE DARKNESS IS NOT DARK TO YOU; THE NIGHT IS BRIGHT AS THE DAY FOR DARKNESS IS AS LIGHT WITH YOU

FOR YOU FORMED MY INWARD PARTS; YOU KNITTED ME TOGETHER IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB

I PRAISE YOU FOR I AM FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE

WONDERFUL ARE YOUR WORKS; MY SOUL KNOWS IT VERY WELL

MY FRAME WAS NOT HIDDEN FROM YOU WHEN I WAS BEING MADE IN SECRET INTRICATELY WOVEN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH

YOUR EYES SAW MY UNFORMED SUBSTANCE; IN YOUR BOOK WERE WRITTEN EVERY ONE OF THEM THE DAYS THAT WERE FORMED FOR ME WHEN AS YET THERE WERE NONE OF THEM

HOW PRECIOUS TO ME ARE YOUR THOUGHTS O GOD

HOW VAST IS THE SUM OF THEM

IF I WOULD COUNT THEM THEY ARE MORE THAN THE SAND

I AWAKE AND I AM STILL WITH YOU

OH THAT YOU WOULD SLAY THE WICKED O GOD

O MEN OF BLOOD DEPART FROM ME

THEY SPEAK AGAINST YOU WITH MALICIOUS INTENT; YOUR ENEMIES TAKE YOUR NAME IN VAIN

DO I NOT HATE THOSE WHO HATE YOU O LORD

AND DO I NOT LOATHE THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST YOU

I HATE THEM WITH COMPLETE HATRED; I COUNT THEM MY ENEMIES

SEARCH ME O GOD AND KNOW MY HEART

TRY ME AND KNOW MY THOUGHTS

AND SEE IF THERE BE ANY GRIEVOUS WAY IN ME AND LEAD ME IN THE WAY EVERLASTING

DELIVER ME O LORD FROM EVIL MEN; PRESERVE ME FROM VIOLENT MEN WHO PLAN EVIL THINGS IN THEIR HEART AND STIR UP WARS CONTINUALLY

THEY MAKE THEIR TONGUE SHARP AS A SERPENT'S AND UNDER THEIR LIPS IS THE VENOM OF ASPS

SELAH GUARD ME O LORD FROM THE HANDS OF THE WICKED; PRESERVE ME FROM VIOLENT MEN WHO HAVE PLANNED TO TRIP UP MY FEET

THE ARROGANT HAVE HIDDEN A TRAP FOR ME AND WITH CORDS THEY HAVE SPREAD A NET; BESIDE THE WAY THEY HAVE SET SNARES FOR ME

SELAH I SAY TO THE LORD YOU ARE MY GOD; GIVE EAR TO THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY O LORD

O LORD MY LORD THE STRENGTH OF MY SALVATION YOU HAVE COVERED MY HEAD IN THE DAY OF BATTLE

GRANT NOT O LORD THE DESIRES OF THE WICKED; DO NOT FURTHER THEIR EVIL PLOT OR THEY WILL BE EXALTED

SELAH AS FOR THE HEAD OF THOSE WHO SURROUND ME LET THE MISCHIEF OF THEIR LIPS OVERWHELM THEM

LET BURNING COALS FALL UPON THEM

LET THEM BE CAST INTO FIRE INTO MIRY PITS NO MORE TO RISE

LET NOT THE SLANDERER BE ESTABLISHED IN THE LAND; LET EVIL HUNT DOWN THE VIOLENT MAN SPEEDILY

I KNOW THAT THE LORD WILL MAINTAIN THE CAUSE OF THE AFFLICTED AND WILL EXECUTE JUSTICE FOR THE NEEDY

SURELY THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME; THE UPRIGHT SHALL DWELL IN YOUR PRESENCE

O LORD I CALL UPON YOU; HASTEN TO ME

GIVE EAR TO MY VOICE WHEN I CALL TO YOU

LET MY PRAYER BE COUNTED AS INCENSE BEFORE YOU AND THE LIFTING UP OF MY HANDS AS THE EVENING SACRIFICE

SET A GUARD O LORD OVER MY MOUTH; KEEP WATCH OVER THE DOOR OF MY LIPS

DO NOT LET MY HEART INCLINE TO ANY EVIL TO BUSY MYSELF WITH WICKED DEEDS IN COMPANY WITH MEN WHO WORK INIQUITY AND LET ME NOT EAT OF THEIR DELICACIES

LET A RIGHTEOUS MAN STRIKE MEIT IS A KINDNESS; LET HIM REBUKE MEIT IS OIL FOR MY HEAD; LET MY HEAD NOT REFUSE IT

YET MY PRAYER IS CONTINUALLY AGAINST THEIR EVIL DEEDS

WHEN THEIR JUDGES ARE THROWN OVER THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHALL HEAR MY WORDS FOR THEY ARE PLEASANT

AS WHEN ONE PLOWS AND BREAKS UP THE EARTH SO SHALL OUR BONES BE SCATTERED AT THE MOUTH OF SHEOL

BUT MY EYES ARE TOWARD YOU O GOD MY LORD; IN YOU I SEEK REFUGE; LEAVE ME NOT DEFENSELESS

KEEP ME FROM THE TRAP THAT THEY HAVE LAID FOR ME AND FROM THE SNARES OF EVILDOERS

LET THE WICKED FALL INTO THEIR OWN NETS WHILE I PASS BY SAFELY

WITH MY VOICE I CRY OUT TO THE LORD; WITH MY VOICE I PLEAD FOR MERCY TO THE LORD

I POUR OUT MY COMPLAINT BEFORE HIM; I TELL MY TROUBLE BEFORE HIM

WHEN MY SPIRIT FAINTS WITHIN ME YOU KNOW MY WAY

IN THE PATH WHERE I WALK THEY HAVE HIDDEN A TRAP FOR ME

LOOK TO THE RIGHT AND SEE THERE IS NONE WHO TAKES NOTICE OF ME; NO REFUGE REMAINS TO ME; NO ONE CARES FOR MY SOUL

I CRY TO YOU O LORD; I SAY YOU ARE MY REFUGE MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING

 ATTEND TO MY CRY FOR I AM BROUGHT VERY LOW

DELIVER ME FROM MY PERSECUTORS FOR THEY ARE TOO STRONG FOR ME

BRING ME OUT OF PRISON THAT I MAY GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME

THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SURROUND ME FOR YOU WILL DEAL BOUNTIFULLY WITH ME

HEAR MY PRAYER O LORD; GIVE EAR TO MY PLEAS FOR MERCY

IN YOUR FAITHFULNESS ANSWER ME IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

ENTER NOT INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOUR SERVANT FOR NO ONE LIVING IS RIGHTEOUS BEFORE YOU

FOR THE ENEMY HAS PURSUED MY SOUL; HE HAS CRUSHED MY LIFE TO THE GROUND; HE HAS MADE ME SIT IN DARKNESS LIKE THOSE LONG DEAD

THEREFORE MY SPIRIT FAINTS WITHIN ME; MY HEART WITHIN ME IS APPALLED

I REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD; I MEDITATE ON ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE; I PONDER THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

I STRETCH OUT MY HANDS TO YOU; MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR YOU LIKE A PARCHED LAND

SELAH ANSWER ME QUICKLY O LORD

MY SPIRIT FAILS

HIDE NOT YOUR FACE FROM ME LEST I BE LIKE THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT

LET ME HEAR IN THE MORNING OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE FOR IN YOU I TRUST

MAKE ME KNOW THE WAY I SHOULD GO FOR TO YOU I LIFT UP MY SOUL

DELIVER ME FROM MY ENEMIES O LORD

I HAVE FLED TO YOU FOR REFUGE

TEACH ME TO DO YOUR WILL FOR YOU ARE MY GOD

LET YOUR GOOD SPIRIT LEAD ME ON LEVEL GROUND

FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE O LORD PRESERVE MY LIFE

IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BRING MY SOUL OUT OF TROUBLE

AND IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE YOU WILL CUT OFF MY ENEMIES AND YOU WILL DESTROY ALL THE ADVERSARIES OF MY SOUL FOR I AM YOUR SERVANT

BLESSED BE THE LORD MY ROCK WHO TRAINS MY HANDS FOR WAR AND MY FINGERS FOR BATTLE; HE IS MY STEADFAST LOVE AND MY FORTRESS MY STRONGHOLD AND MY DELIVERER MY SHIELD AND HE IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE WHO SUBDUES PEOPLES UNDER ME

O LORD WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU REGARD HIM OR THE SON OF MAN THAT YOU THINK OF HIM

MAN IS LIKE A BREATH; HIS DAYS ARE LIKE A PASSING SHADOW

BOW YOUR HEAVENS O LORD AND COME DOWN

TOUCH THE MOUNTAINS SO THAT THEY SMOKE

FLASH FORTH THE LIGHTNING AND SCATTER THEM; SEND OUT YOUR ARROWS AND ROUT THEM

STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND FROM ON HIGH; RESCUE ME AND DELIVER ME FROM THE MANY WATERS FROM THE HAND OF FOREIGNERS WHOSE MOUTHS SPEAK LIES AND WHOSE RIGHT HAND IS A RIGHT HAND OF FALSEHOOD

I WILL SING A NEW SONG TO YOU O GOD; UPON A TENSTRINGED HARP I WILL PLAY TO YOU WHO GIVES VICTORY TO KINGS WHO RESCUES DAVID HIS SERVANT FROM THE CRUEL SWORD

RESCUE ME AND DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF FOREIGNERS WHOSE MOUTHS SPEAK LIES AND WHOSE RIGHT HAND IS A RIGHT HAND OF FALSEHOOD

MAY OUR SONS IN THEIR YOUTH BE LIKE PLANTS FULL GROWN OUR DAUGHTERS LIKE CORNER PILLARS CUT FOR THE STRUCTURE OF A PALACE; MAY OUR GRANARIES BE FULL PROVIDING ALL KINDS OF PRODUCE; MAY OUR SHEEP BRING FORTH THOUSANDS AND TEN THOUSANDS IN OUR FIELDS; MAY OUR CATTLE BE HEAVY WITH YOUNG SUFFERING NO MISHAP OR FAILURE IN BEARING; MAY THERE BE NO CRY OF DISTRESS IN OUR STREETS

BLESSED ARE THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SUCH BLESSINGS FALL

BLESSED ARE THE PEOPLE WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD

I WILL EXTOL YOU MY GOD AND KING AND BLESS YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER

EVERY DAY I WILL BLESS YOU AND PRAISE YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER

GREAT IS THE LORD AND GREATLY TO BE PRAISED AND HIS GREATNESS IS UNSEARCHABLE

ONE GENERATION SHALL COMMEND YOUR WORKS TO ANOTHER AND SHALL DECLARE YOUR MIGHTY ACTS

ON THE GLORIOUS SPLENDOR OF YOUR MAJESTY AND ON YOUR WONDROUS WORKS I WILL MEDITATE

THEY SHALL SPEAK OF THE MIGHT OF YOUR AWESOME DEEDS AND I WILL DECLARE YOUR GREATNESS

THEY SHALL POUR FORTH THE FAME OF YOUR ABUNDANT GOODNESS AND SHALL SING ALOUD OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

THE LORD IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE

THE LORD IS GOOD TO ALL AND HIS MERCY IS OVER ALL THAT HE HAS MADE

ALL YOUR WORKS SHALL GIVE THANKS TO YOU O LORD AND ALL YOUR SAINTS SHALL BLESS YOU

THEY SHALL SPEAK OF THE GLORY OF YOUR KINGDOM AND TELL OF YOUR POWER TO MAKE KNOWN TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN YOUR MIGHTY DEEDS AND THE GLORIOUS SPLENDOR OF YOUR KINGDOM

YOUR KINGDOM IS AN EVERLASTING KINGDOM AND YOUR DOMINION ENDURES THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS

[THE LORD IS FAITHFUL IN ALL HIS WORDS AND KIND IN ALL HIS WORKS

] THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO ARE FALLING AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN

THE EYES OF ALL LOOK TO YOU AND YOU GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD IN DUE SEASON

YOU OPEN YOUR HAND; YOU SATISFY THE DESIRE OF EVERY LIVING THING

THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS IN ALL HIS WAYS AND KIND IN ALL HIS WORKS

THE LORD IS NEAR TO ALL WHO CALL ON HIM TO ALL WHO CALL ON HIM IN TRUTH

HE FULFILLS THE DESIRE OF THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; HE ALSO HEARS THEIR CRY AND SAVES THEM

THE LORD PRESERVES ALL WHO LOVE HIM BUT ALL THE WICKED HE WILL DESTROY

MY MOUTH WILL SPEAK THE PRAISE OF THE LORD AND LET ALL FLESH BLESS HIS HOLY NAME FOREVER AND EVER

PRAISE THE LORD

PRAISE THE LORD O MY SOUL

I WILL PRAISE THE LORD AS LONG AS I LIVE; I WILL SING PRAISES TO MY GOD WHILE I HAVE MY BEING

PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES IN A SON OF MAN IN WHOM THERE IS NO SALVATION

WHEN HIS BREATH DEPARTS HE RETURNS TO THE EARTH; ON THAT VERY DAY HIS PLANS PERISH

BLESSED IS HE WHOSE HELP IS THE GOD OF JACOB WHOSE HOPE IS IN THE LORD HIS GOD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM WHO KEEPS FAITH FOREVER; WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED WHO GIVES FOOD TO THE HUNGRY

THE LORD SETS THE PRISONERS FREE; THE LORD OPENS THE EYES OF THE BLIND

THE LORD LIFTS UP THOSE WHO ARE BOWED DOWN; THE LORD LOVES THE RIGHTEOUS

THE LORD WATCHES OVER THE SOJOURNERS; HE UPHOLDS THE WIDOW AND THE FATHERLESS BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED HE BRINGS TO RUIN

THE LORD WILL REIGN FOREVER YOUR GOD O ZION TO ALL GENERATIONS

PRAISE THE LORD

PRAISE THE LORD

FOR IT IS GOOD TO SING PRAISES TO OUR GOD; FOR IT IS PLEASANT AND A SONG OF PRAISE IS FITTING

THE LORD BUILDS UP JERUSALEM; HE GATHERS THE OUTCASTS OF ISRAEL

HE HEALS THE BROKENHEARTED AND BINDS UP THEIR WOUNDS

HE DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF THE STARS; HE GIVES TO ALL OF THEM THEIR NAMES

GREAT IS OUR LORD AND ABUNDANT IN POWER; HIS UNDERSTANDING IS BEYOND MEASURE

THE LORD LIFTS UP THE HUMBLE; HE CASTS THE WICKED TO THE GROUND

SING TO THE LORD WITH THANKSGIVING; MAKE MELODY TO OUR GOD ON THE LYRE

HE COVERS THE HEAVENS WITH CLOUDS; HE PREPARES RAIN FOR THE EARTH; HE MAKES GRASS GROW ON THE HILLS

HE GIVES TO THE BEASTS THEIR FOOD AND TO THE YOUNG RAVENS THAT CRY

HIS DELIGHT IS NOT IN THE STRENGTH OF THE HORSE NOR HIS PLEASURE IN THE LEGS OF A MAN BUT THE LORD TAKES PLEASURE IN THOSE WHO FEAR HIM IN THOSE WHO HOPE IN HIS STEADFAST LOVE

PRAISE THE LORD O JERUSALEM

PRAISE YOUR GOD O ZION

FOR HE STRENGTHENS THE BARS OF YOUR GATES; HE BLESSES YOUR CHILDREN WITHIN YOU

HE MAKES PEACE IN YOUR BORDERS; HE FILLS YOU WITH THE FINEST OF THE WHEAT

ZEPHANIAHTHE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO ZEPHANIAH THE SON OF CUSHI SON OF GEDALIAH SON OF AMARIAH SON OF HEZEKIAH IN THE DAYS OF JOSIAH THE SON OF AMON KING OF JUDAH

I WILL UTTERLY SWEEP AWAY EVERYTHING FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL SWEEP AWAY MAN AND BEAST; I WILL SWEEP AWAY THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE FISH OF THE SEA AND THE RUBBLE WITH THE WICKED

I WILL CUT OFF MANKIND FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH DECLARES THE LORD

I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST JUDAH AND AGAINST ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM; AND I WILL CUT OFF FROM THIS PLACE THE REMNANT OF BAAL AND THE NAME OF THE IDOLATROUS PRIESTS ALONG WITH THE PRIESTS THOSE WHO BOW DOWN ON THE ROOFS TO THE HOST OF THE HEAVENS THOSE WHO BOW DOWN AND SWEAR TO THE LORD AND YET SWEAR BY MILCOM THOSE WHO HAVE TURNED BACK FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD WHO DO NOT SEEK THE LORD OR INQUIRE OF HIM

 BE SILENT BEFORE THE LORD GOD

FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR; THE LORD HAS PREPARED A SACRIFICE AND CONSECRATED HIS GUESTS

AND ON THE DAY OF THE LORD'S SACRIFICEI WILL PUNISH THE OFFICIALS AND THE KING'S SONS AND ALL WHO ARRAY THEMSELVES IN FOREIGN ATTIRE

ON THAT DAY I WILL PUNISH EVERYONE WHO LEAPS OVER THE THRESHOLD AND THOSE WHO FILL THEIR MASTER'S HOUSE WITH VIOLENCE AND FRAUD

ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD A CRY WILL BE HEARD FROM THE FISH GATE A WAIL FROM THE SECOND QUARTER A LOUD CRASH FROM THE HILLS

WAIL O INHABITANTS OF THE MORTAR

FOR ALL THE TRADERS ARE NO MORE; ALL WHO WEIGH OUT SILVER ARE CUT OFF

AT THAT TIME I WILL SEARCH JERUSALEM WITH LAMPS AND I WILL PUNISH THE MEN WHO ARE COMPLACENT THOSE WHO SAY IN THEIR HEARTS 'THE LORD WILL NOT DO GOOD NOR WILL HE DO ILL

' THEIR GOODS SHALL BE PLUNDERED AND THEIR HOUSES LAID WASTE

THOUGH THEY BUILD HOUSES THEY SHALL NOT INHABIT THEM; THOUGH THEY PLANT VINEYARDS THEY SHALL NOT DRINK WINE FROM THEM

 THE GREAT DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR NEAR AND HASTENING FAST; THE SOUND OF THE DAY OF THE LORD IS BITTER; THE MIGHTY MAN CRIES ALOUD THERE

A DAY OF WRATH IS THAT DAY A DAY OF DISTRESS AND ANGUISH A DAY OF RUIN AND DEVASTATION A DAY OF DARKNESS AND GLOOM A DAY OF CLOUDS AND THICK DARKNESS A DAY OF TRUMPET BLAST AND BATTLE CRY AGAINST THE FORTIFIED CITIES AND AGAINST THE LOFTY BATTLEMENTS

I WILL BRING DISTRESS ON MANKIND SO THAT THEY SHALL WALK LIKE THE BLIND BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD; THEIR BLOOD SHALL BE POURED OUT LIKE DUST AND THEIR FLESH LIKE DUNG

NEITHER THEIR SILVER NOR THEIR GOLD SHALL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THEM ON THE DAY OF THE WRATH OF THE LORD

IN THE FIRE OF HIS JEALOUSY ALL THE EARTH SHALL BE CONSUMED; FOR A FULL AND SUDDEN END HE WILL MAKE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH

GATHER TOGETHER YES GATHER O SHAMELESS NATION BEFORE THE DECREE TAKES EFFECTBEFORE THE DAY PASSES AWAY LIKE CHAFFBEFORE THERE COMES UPON YOU THE BURNING ANGER OF THE LORD BEFORE THERE COMES UPON YOU THE DAY OF THE ANGER OF THE LORD

SEEK THE LORD ALL YOU HUMBLE OF THE LAND WHO DO HIS JUST COMMANDS; SEEK RIGHTEOUSNESS; SEEK HUMILITY; PERHAPS YOU MAY BE HIDDEN ON THE DAY OF THE ANGER OF THE LORD

FOR GAZA SHALL BE DESERTED AND ASHKELON SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION; ASHDOD'S PEOPLE SHALL BE DRIVEN OUT AT NOON AND EKRON SHALL BE UPROOTED

WOE TO YOU INHABITANTS OF THE SEACOAST YOU NATION OF THE CHERETHITES

THE WORD OF THE LORD IS AGAINST YOU O CANAAN LAND OF THE PHILISTINES; AND I WILL DESTROY YOU UNTIL NO INHABITANT IS LEFT

AND YOU O SEACOAST SHALL BE PASTURES WITH MEADOWS FOR SHEPHERDS AND FOLDS FOR FLOCKS

THE SEACOAST SHALL BECOME THE POSSESSION OF THE REMNANT OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH ON WHICH THEY SHALL GRAZE AND IN THE HOUSES OF ASHKELON THEY SHALL LIE DOWN AT EVENING

FOR THE LORD THEIR GOD WILL BE MINDFUL OF THEM AND RESTORE THEIR FORTUNES

I HAVE HEARD THE TAUNTS OF MOAB AND THE REVILINGS OF THE AMMONITES HOW THEY HAVE TAUNTED MY PEOPLE AND MADE BOASTS AGAINST THEIR TERRITORY

THEREFORE AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF ISRAEL MOAB SHALL BECOME LIKE SODOM AND THE AMMONITES LIKE GOMORRAH A LAND POSSESSED BY NETTLES AND SALT PITS AND A WASTE FOREVER

THE REMNANT OF MY PEOPLE SHALL PLUNDER THEM AND THE SURVIVORS OF MY NATION SHALL POSSESS THEM

 THIS SHALL BE THEIR LOT IN RETURN FOR THEIR PRIDE BECAUSE THEY TAUNTED AND BOASTED AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS

THE LORD WILL BE AWESOME AGAINST THEM; FOR HE WILL FAMISH ALL THE GODS OF THE EARTH AND TO HIM SHALL BOW DOWN EACH IN ITS PLACE ALL THE LANDS OF THE NATIONS

YOU ALSO O CUSHITES SHALL BE SLAIN BY MY SWORD

AND HE WILL STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE NORTH AND DESTROY ASSYRIA AND HE WILL MAKE NINEVEH A DESOLATION A DRY WASTE LIKE THE DESERT

HERDS SHALL LIE DOWN IN HER MIDST ALL KINDS OF BEASTS; EVEN THE OWL AND THE HEDGEHOG SHALL LODGE IN HER CAPITALS; A VOICE SHALL HOOT IN THE WINDOW; DEVASTATION WILL BE ON THE THRESHOLD; FOR HER CEDAR WORK WILL BE LAID BARE

THIS IS THE EXULTANT CITY THAT LIVED SECURELY THAT SAID IN HER HEART I AM AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE

 WHAT A DESOLATION SHE HAS BECOME A LAIR FOR WILD BEASTS

EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY HER HISSES AND SHAKES HIS FIST

WOE TO HER WHO IS REBELLIOUS AND DEFILED THE OPPRESSING CITY

SHE LISTENS TO NO VOICE; SHE ACCEPTS NO CORRECTION

SHE DOES NOT TRUST IN THE LORD; SHE DOES NOT DRAW NEAR TO HER GOD

HER OFFICIALS WITHIN HER ARE ROARING LIONS; HER JUDGES ARE EVENING WOLVES THAT LEAVE NOTHING TILL THE MORNING

HER PROPHETS ARE FICKLE TREACHEROUS MEN; HER PRIESTS PROFANE WHAT IS HOLY; THEY DO VIOLENCE TO THE LAW

THE LORD WITHIN HER IS RIGHTEOUS; HE DOES NO INJUSTICE; EVERY MORNING HE SHOWS FORTH HIS JUSTICE; EACH DAWN HE DOES NOT FAIL; BUT THE UNJUST KNOWS NO SHAME

I HAVE CUT OFF NATIONS; THEIR BATTLEMENTS ARE IN RUINS; I HAVE LAID WASTE THEIR STREETS SO THAT NO ONE WALKS IN THEM; THEIR CITIES HAVE BEEN MADE DESOLATE WITHOUT A MAN WITHOUT AN INHABITANT

I SAID 'SURELY YOU WILL FEAR ME; YOU WILL ACCEPT CORRECTION

THEN YOUR DWELLING WOULD NOT BE CUT OFF ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I HAVE APPOINTED AGAINST YOU

' BUT ALL THE MORE THEY WERE EAGER TO MAKE ALL THEIR DEEDS CORRUPT

THEREFORE WAIT FOR ME DECLARES THE LORD FOR THE DAY WHEN I RISE UP TO SEIZE THE PREY

FOR MY DECISION IS TO GATHER NATIONS TO ASSEMBLE KINGDOMS TO POUR OUT UPON THEM MY INDIGNATION ALL MY BURNING ANGER; FOR IN THE FIRE OF MY JEALOUSY ALL THE EARTH SHALL BE CONSUMED

FOR AT THAT TIME I WILL CHANGE THE SPEECH OF THE PEOPLES TO A PURE SPEECH THAT ALL OF THEM MAY CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD AND SERVE HIM WITH ONE ACCORD

FROM BEYOND THE RIVERS OF CUSH MY WORSHIPERS THE DAUGHTER OF MY DISPERSED ONES SHALL BRING MY OFFERING

ON THAT DAY YOU SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME BECAUSE OF THE DEEDS BY WHICH YOU HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME; FOR THEN I WILL REMOVE FROM YOUR MIDST YOUR PROUDLY EXULTANT ONES AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER BE HAUGHTY IN MY HOLY MOUNTAIN

BUT I WILL LEAVE IN YOUR MIDST A PEOPLE HUMBLE AND LOWLY

THEY SHALL SEEK REFUGE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD THOSE WHO ARE LEFT IN ISRAEL; THEY SHALL DO NO INJUSTICE AND SPEAK NO LIES NOR SHALL THERE BE FOUND IN THEIR MOUTH A DECEITFUL TONGUE

FOR THEY SHALL GRAZE AND LIE DOWN AND NONE SHALL MAKE THEM AFRAID

 SING ALOUD O DAUGHTER OF ZION; SHOUT O ISRAEL

REJOICE AND EXULT WITH ALL YOUR HEART O DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

AT THAT TIME I WILL BRING YOU IN AT THE TIME WHEN I GATHER YOU TOGETHER; FOR I WILL MAKE YOU RENOWNED AND PRAISED AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH WHEN I RESTORE YOUR FORTUNES BEFORE YOUR EYES SAYS THE LORD

JOELTHE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO JOEL THE SON OF PETHUEL HEAR THIS YOU ELDERS; GIVE EAR ALL INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

HAS SUCH A THING HAPPENED IN YOUR DAYS OR IN THE DAYS OF YOUR FATHERS

TELL YOUR CHILDREN OF IT AND LET YOUR CHILDREN TELL THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN TO ANOTHER GENERATION

WHAT THE CUTTING LOCUST LEFT THE SWARMING LOCUST HAS EATEN

WHAT THE SWARMING LOCUST LEFT THE HOPPING LOCUST HAS EATEN AND WHAT THE HOPPING LOCUST LEFT THE DESTROYING LOCUST HAS EATEN

AWAKE YOU DRUNKARDS AND WEEP AND WAIL ALL YOU DRINKERS OF WINE BECAUSE OF THE SWEET WINE FOR IT IS CUT OFF FROM YOUR MOUTH

FOR A NATION HAS COME UP AGAINST MY LAND POWERFUL AND BEYOND NUMBER; ITS TEETH ARE LIONS' TEETH AND IT HAS THE FANGS OF A LIONESS

IT HAS LAID WASTE MY VINE AND SPLINTERED MY FIG TREE; IT HAS STRIPPED OFF THEIR BARK AND THROWN IT DOWN; THEIR BRANCHES ARE MADE WHITE

LAMENT LIKE A VIRGIN WEARING SACKCLOTH FOR THE BRIDEGROOM OF HER YOUTH

THE GRAIN OFFERING AND THE DRINK OFFERING ARE CUT OFF FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THE PRIESTS MOURN THE MINISTERS OF THE LORD

THE FIELDS ARE DESTROYED THE GROUND MOURNS BECAUSE THE GRAIN IS DESTROYED THE WINE DRIES UP THE OIL LANGUISHES

BE ASHAMED O TILLERS OF THE SOIL; WAIL O VINEDRESSERS FOR THE WHEAT AND THE BARLEY BECAUSE THE HARVEST OF THE FIELD HAS PERISHED

THE VINE DRIES UP; THE FIG TREE LANGUISHES

POMEGRANATE PALM AND APPLE ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD ARE DRIED UP AND GLADNESS DRIES UP FROM THE CHILDREN OF MAN

PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND LAMENT O PRIESTS; WAIL O MINISTERS OF THE ALTAR

GO IN PASS THE NIGHT IN SACKCLOTH O MINISTERS OF MY GOD

BECAUSE GRAIN OFFERING AND DRINK OFFERING ARE WITHHELD FROM THE HOUSE OF YOUR GOD

CONSECRATE A FAST; CALL A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY

GATHER THE ELDERS AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD AND CRY OUT TO THE LORD

ALAS FOR THE DAY

FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR AND AS DESTRUCTION FROM THE ALMIGHTY IT COMES

IS NOT THE FOOD CUT OFF BEFORE OUR EYES JOY AND GLADNESS FROM THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD

THE SEED SHRIVELS UNDER THE CLODS; THE STOREHOUSES ARE DESOLATE; THE GRANARIES ARE TORN DOWN BECAUSE THE GRAIN HAS DRIED UP

HOW THE BEASTS GROAN

THE HERDS OF CATTLE ARE PERPLEXED BECAUSE THERE IS NO PASTURE FOR THEM; EVEN THE FLOCKS OF SHEEP SUFFER

TO YOU O LORD I CALL

FOR FIRE HAS DEVOURED THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS AND FLAME HAS BURNED ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD

EVEN THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD PANT FOR YOU BECAUSE THE WATER BROOKS ARE DRIED UP AND FIRE HAS DEVOURED THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS

BLOW A TRUMPET IN ZION; SOUND AN ALARM ON MY HOLY MOUNTAIN

LET ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND TREMBLE FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS COMING; IT IS NEAR A DAY OF DARKNESS AND GLOOM A DAY OF CLOUDS AND THICK DARKNESS

LIKE BLACKNESS THERE IS SPREAD UPON THE MOUNTAINS A GREAT AND POWERFUL PEOPLE; THEIR LIKE HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE NOR WILL BE AGAIN AFTER THEM THROUGH THE YEARS OF ALL GENERATIONS

FIRE DEVOURS BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM A FLAME BURNS

THE LAND IS LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN BEFORE THEM BUT BEHIND THEM A DESOLATE WILDERNESS AND NOTHING ESCAPES THEM

THEIR APPEARANCE IS LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF HORSES AND LIKE WAR HORSES THEY RUN

AS WITH THE RUMBLING OF CHARIOTS THEY LEAP ON THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS LIKE THE CRACKLING OF A FLAME OF FIRE DEVOURING THE STUBBLE LIKE A POWERFUL ARMY DRAWN UP FOR BATTLE

BEFORE THEM PEOPLES ARE IN ANGUISH; ALL FACES GROW PALE

LIKE WARRIORS THEY CHARGE; LIKE SOLDIERS THEY SCALE THE WALL

THEY MARCH EACH ON HIS WAY; THEY DO NOT SWERVE FROM THEIR PATHS

THEY DO NOT JOSTLE ONE ANOTHER; EACH MARCHES IN HIS PATH; THEY BURST THROUGH THE WEAPONS AND ARE NOT HALTED

THEY LEAP UPON THE CITY THEY RUN UPON THE WALLS THEY CLIMB UP INTO THE HOUSES THEY ENTER THROUGH THE WINDOWS LIKE A THIEF

THE EARTH QUAKES BEFORE THEM; THE HEAVENS TREMBLE

THE SUN AND THE MOON ARE DARKENED AND THE STARS WITHDRAW THEIR SHINING

THE LORD UTTERS HIS VOICE BEFORE HIS ARMY FOR HIS CAMP IS EXCEEDINGLY GREAT; HE WHO EXECUTES HIS WORD IS POWERFUL

FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS GREAT AND VERY AWESOME; WHO CAN ENDURE IT

YET EVEN NOW DECLARES THE LORD RETURN TO ME WITH ALL YOUR HEART WITH FASTING WITH WEEPING AND WITH MOURNING; AND REND YOUR HEARTS AND NOT YOUR GARMENTS

 RETURN TO THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR HE IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE; AND HE RELENTS OVER DISASTER

WHO KNOWS WHETHER HE WILL NOT TURN AND RELENT AND LEAVE A BLESSING BEHIND HIM A GRAIN OFFERING AND A DRINK OFFERING FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD

BLOW THE TRUMPET IN ZION; CONSECRATE A FAST; CALL A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY; GATHER THE PEOPLE

CONSECRATE THE CONGREGATION; ASSEMBLE THE ELDERS; GATHER THE CHILDREN EVEN NURSING INFANTS

LET THE BRIDEGROOM LEAVE HIS ROOM AND THE BRIDE HER CHAMBER

BETWEEN THE VESTIBULE AND THE ALTAR LET THE PRIESTS THE MINISTERS OF THE LORD WEEP AND SAY SPARE YOUR PEOPLE O LORD AND MAKE NOT YOUR HERITAGE A REPROACH A BYWORD AMONG THE NATIONS

WHY SHOULD THEY SAY AMONG THE PEOPLES 'WHERE IS THEIR GOD

' THEN THE LORD BECAME JEALOUS FOR HIS LAND AND HAD PITY ON HIS PEOPLE

THE LORD ANSWERED AND SAID TO HIS PEOPLE BEHOLD I AM SENDING TO YOU GRAIN WINE AND OIL AND YOU WILL BE SATISFIED; AND I WILL NO MORE MAKE YOU A REPROACH AMONG THE NATIONS

I WILL REMOVE THE NORTHERNER FAR FROM YOU AND DRIVE HIM INTO A PARCHED AND DESOLATE LAND HIS VANGUARD INTO THE EASTERN SEA AND HIS REAR GUARD INTO THE WESTERN SEA; THE STENCH AND FOUL SMELL OF HIM WILL RISE FOR HE HAS DONE GREAT THINGS

FEAR NOT O LAND; BE GLAD AND REJOICE FOR THE LORD HAS DONE GREAT THINGS

FEAR NOT YOU BEASTS OF THE FIELD FOR THE PASTURES OF THE WILDERNESS ARE GREEN; THE TREE BEARS ITS FRUIT; THE FIG TREE AND VINE GIVE THEIR FULL YIELD

BE GLAD O CHILDREN OF ZION AND REJOICE IN THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR HE HAS GIVEN THE EARLY RAIN FOR YOUR VINDICATION; HE HAS POURED DOWN FOR YOU ABUNDANT RAIN THE EARLY AND THE LATTER RAIN AS BEFORE

THE THRESHING FLOORS SHALL BE FULL OF GRAIN; THE VATS SHALL OVERFLOW WITH WINE AND OIL

I WILL RESTORE TO YOU THE YEARS THAT THE SWARMING LOCUST HAS EATEN THE HOPPER THE DESTROYER AND THE CUTTER MY GREAT ARMY WHICH I SENT AMONG YOU

YOU SHALL EAT IN PLENTY AND BE SATISFIED AND PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS DEALT WONDROUSLY WITH YOU

AND MY PEOPLE SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE PUT TO SHAME

YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM IN THE MIDST OF ISRAEL AND THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD AND THERE IS NONE ELSE

AND MY PEOPLE SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE PUT TO SHAME

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS AFTERWARD THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT ON ALL FLESH; YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS

EVEN ON THE MALE AND FEMALE SERVANTS IN THOSE DAYS I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT

AND I WILL SHOW WONDERS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON THE EARTH BLOOD AND FIRE AND COLUMNS OF SMOKE

THE SUN SHALL BE TURNED TO DARKNESS AND THE MOON TO BLOOD BEFORE THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD COMES

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED

FOR IN MOUNT ZION AND IN JERUSALEM THERE SHALL BE THOSE WHO ESCAPE AS THE LORD HAS SAID AND AMONG THE SURVIVORS SHALL BE THOSE WHOM THE LORD CALLS

FOR BEHOLD IN THOSE DAYS AND AT THAT TIME WHEN I RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM I WILL GATHER ALL THE NATIONS AND BRING THEM DOWN TO THE VALLEY OF JEHOSHAPHAT

AND I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH THEM THERE ON BEHALF OF MY PEOPLE AND MY HERITAGE ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SCATTERED THEM AMONG THE NATIONS AND HAVE DIVIDED UP MY LAND AND HAVE CAST LOTS FOR MY PEOPLE AND HAVE TRADED A BOY FOR A PROSTITUTE AND HAVE SOLD A GIRL FOR WINE AND HAVE DRUNK IT

WHAT ARE YOU TO ME O TYRE AND SIDON AND ALL THE REGIONS OF PHILISTIA

ARE YOU PAYING ME BACK FOR SOMETHING

IF YOU ARE PAYING ME BACK I WILL RETURN YOUR PAYMENT ON YOUR OWN HEAD SWIFTLY AND SPEEDILY

FOR YOU HAVE TAKEN MY SILVER AND MY GOLD AND HAVE CARRIED MY RICH TREASURES INTO YOUR TEMPLES

YOU HAVE SOLD THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM TO THE GREEKS IN ORDER TO REMOVE THEM FAR FROM THEIR OWN BORDER

BEHOLD I WILL STIR THEM UP FROM THE PLACE TO WHICH YOU HAVE SOLD THEM AND I WILL RETURN YOUR PAYMENT ON YOUR OWN HEAD

I WILL SELL YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS INTO THE HAND OF THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND THEY WILL SELL THEM TO THE SABEANS TO A NATION FAR AWAY FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN

 PROCLAIM THIS AMONG THE NATIONS CONSECRATE FOR WAR; STIR UP THE MIGHTY MEN

LET ALL THE MEN OF WAR DRAW NEAR; LET THEM COME UP

BEAT YOUR PLOWSHARES INTO SWORDS AND YOUR PRUNING HOOKS INTO SPEARS; LET THE WEAK SAY I AM A WARRIOR

 HASTEN AND COME ALL YOU SURROUNDING NATIONS AND GATHER YOURSELVES THERE

BRING DOWN YOUR WARRIORS O LORD

LET THE NATIONS STIR THEMSELVES UP AND COME UP TO THE VALLEY OF JEHOSHAPHAT; FOR THERE I WILL SIT TO JUDGE ALL THE SURROUNDING NATIONS

PUT IN THE SICKLE FOR THE HARVEST IS RIPE

GO IN TREAD FOR THE WINEPRESS IS FULL

THE VATS OVERFLOW FOR THEIR EVIL IS GREAT

MULTITUDES MULTITUDES IN THE VALLEY OF DECISION

FOR THE DAY OF THE LORD IS NEAR IN THE VALLEY OF DECISION

THE SUN AND THE MOON ARE DARKENED AND THE STARS WITHDRAW THEIR SHINING

THE LORD ROARS FROM ZION AND UTTERS HIS VOICE FROM JERUSALEM AND THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH QUAKE

BUT THE LORD IS A REFUGE TO HIS PEOPLE A STRONGHOLD TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

SO YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO DWELLS IN ZION MY HOLY MOUNTAIN

AND JERUSALEM SHALL BE HOLY AND STRANGERS SHALL NEVER AGAIN PASS THROUGH IT

AND IN THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL DRIP SWEET WINE AND THE HILLS SHALL FLOW WITH MILK AND ALL THE STREAMBEDS OF JUDAH SHALL FLOW WITH WATER; AND A FOUNTAIN SHALL COME FORTH FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND WATER THE VALLEY OF SHITTIM

EGYPT SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION AND EDOM A DESOLATE WILDERNESS FOR THE VIOLENCE DONE TO THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHED INNOCENT BLOOD IN THEIR LAND

BUT JUDAH SHALL BE INHABITED FOREVER AND JERUSALEM TO ALL GENERATIONS

I WILL AVENGE THEIR BLOOD BLOOD I HAVE NOT AVENGED FOR THE LORD DWELLS IN ZION

NAHUMAN ORACLE CONCERNING NINEVEH

THE BOOK OF THE VISION OF NAHUM OF ELKOSH

THE LORD IS A JEALOUS AND AVENGING GOD; THE LORD IS AVENGING AND WRATHFUL; THE LORD TAKES VENGEANCE ON HIS ADVERSARIES AND KEEPS WRATH FOR HIS ENEMIES

THE LORD IS SLOW TO ANGER AND GREAT IN POWER AND THE LORD WILL BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY

HIS WAY IS IN WHIRLWIND AND STORM AND THE CLOUDS ARE THE DUST OF HIS FEET

HE REBUKES THE SEA AND MAKES IT DRY; HE DRIES UP ALL THE RIVERS; BASHAN AND CARMEL WITHER; THE BLOOM OF LEBANON WITHERS

THE MOUNTAINS QUAKE BEFORE HIM; THE HILLS MELT; THE EARTH HEAVES BEFORE HIM THE WORLD AND ALL WHO DWELL IN IT

WHO CAN STAND BEFORE HIS INDIGNATION

WHO CAN ENDURE THE HEAT OF HIS ANGER

HIS WRATH IS POURED OUT LIKE FIRE AND THE ROCKS ARE BROKEN INTO PIECES BY HIM

THE LORD IS GOOD A STRONGHOLD IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM

BUT WITH AN OVERFLOWING FLOOD HE WILL MAKE A COMPLETE END OF THE ADVERSARIES AND WILL PURSUE HIS ENEMIES INTO DARKNESS

WHAT DO YOU PLOT AGAINST THE LORD

HE WILL MAKE A COMPLETE END; TROUBLE WILL NOT RISE UP A SECOND TIME

FOR THEY ARE LIKE ENTANGLED THORNS LIKE DRUNKARDS AS THEY DRINK; THEY ARE CONSUMED LIKE STUBBLE FULLY DRIED

FROM YOU CAME ONE WHO PLOTTED EVIL AGAINST THE LORD A WORTHLESS COUNSELOR

THUS SAYS THE LORD THOUGH THEY ARE AT FULL STRENGTH AND MANY THEY WILL BE CUT DOWN AND PASS AWAY

THOUGH I HAVE AFFLICTED YOU I WILL AFFLICT YOU NO MORE

AND NOW I WILL BREAK HIS YOKE FROM OFF YOU AND WILL BURST YOUR BONDS APART

KEEP YOUR FEASTS O JUDAH; FULFILL YOUR VOWS FOR NEVER AGAIN SHALL THE WORTHLESS PASS THROUGH YOU; HE IS UTTERLY CUT OFF

THE SCATTERER HAS COME UP AGAINST YOU

MAN THE RAMPARTS; WATCH THE ROAD; DRESS FOR BATTLE; COLLECT ALL YOUR STRENGTH

FOR THE LORD IS RESTORING THE MAJESTY OF JACOB AS THE MAJESTY OF ISRAEL FOR PLUNDERERS HAVE PLUNDERED THEM AND RUINED THEIR BRANCHES

THE SHIELD OF HIS MIGHTY MEN IS RED; HIS SOLDIERS ARE CLOTHED IN SCARLET

THE CHARIOTS COME WITH FLASHING METAL ON THE DAY HE MUSTERS THEM; THE CYPRESS SPEARS ARE BRANDISHED

THE CHARIOTS RACE MADLY THROUGH THE STREETS; THEY RUSH TO AND FRO THROUGH THE SQUARES; THEY GLEAM LIKE TORCHES; THEY DART LIKE LIGHTNING

HE REMEMBERS HIS OFFICERS; THEY STUMBLE AS THEY GO THEY HASTEN TO THE WALL; THE SIEGE TOWER IS SET UP

THE RIVER GATES ARE OPENED; THE PALACE MELTS AWAY; ITS MISTRESS IS STRIPPED; SHE IS CARRIED OFF HER SLAVE GIRLS LAMENTING MOANING LIKE DOVES AND BEATING THEIR BREASTS

NINEVEH IS LIKE A POOL WHOSE WATERS RUN AWAY

HALT

HALT

 THEY CRY BUT NONE TURNS BACK

PLUNDER THE SILVER PLUNDER THE GOLD

THERE IS NO END OF THE TREASURE OR OF THE WEALTH OF ALL PRECIOUS THINGS

DESOLATE

DESOLATION AND RUIN

HEARTS MELT AND KNEES TREMBLE; ANGUISH IS IN ALL LOINS; ALL FACES GROW PALE

WHERE IS THE LIONS' DEN THE FEEDING PLACE OF THE YOUNG LIONS WHERE THE LION AND LIONESS WENT WHERE HIS CUBS WERE WITH NONE TO DISTURB

THE LION TORE ENOUGH FOR HIS CUBS AND STRANGLED PREY FOR HIS LIONESSES; HE FILLED HIS CAVES WITH PREY AND HIS DENS WITH TORN FLESH

BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND I WILL BURN YOUR CHARIOTS IN SMOKE AND THE SWORD SHALL DEVOUR YOUR YOUNG LIONS

I WILL CUT OFF YOUR PREY FROM THE EARTH AND THE VOICE OF YOUR MESSENGERS SHALL NO LONGER BE HEARD

WOE TO THE BLOODY CITY ALL FULL OF LIES AND PLUNDERNO END TO THE PREY

THE CRACK OF THE WHIP AND RUMBLE OF THE WHEEL GALLOPING HORSE AND BOUNDING CHARIOT

HORSEMEN CHARGING FLASHING SWORD AND GLITTERING SPEAR HOSTS OF SLAIN HEAPS OF CORPSES DEAD BODIES WITHOUT ENDTHEY STUMBLE OVER THE BODIES

AND ALL FOR THE COUNTLESS WHORINGS OF THE PROSTITUTE GRACEFUL AND OF DEADLY CHARMS WHO BETRAYS NATIONS WITH HER WHORINGS AND PEOPLES WITH HER CHARMS

BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND WILL LIFT UP YOUR SKIRTS OVER YOUR FACE; AND I WILL MAKE NATIONS LOOK AT YOUR NAKEDNESS AND KINGDOMS AT YOUR SHAME

I WILL THROW FILTH AT YOU AND TREAT YOU WITH CONTEMPT AND MAKE YOU A SPECTACLE

AND ALL WHO LOOK AT YOU WILL SHRINK FROM YOU AND SAY WASTED IS NINEVEH; WHO WILL GRIEVE FOR HER

WHERE SHALL I SEEK COMFORTERS FOR YOU

ARE YOU BETTER THAN THEBES THAT SAT BY THE NILE WITH WATER AROUND HER HER RAMPART A SEA AND WATER HER WALL

CUSH WAS HER STRENGTH; EGYPT TOO AND THAT WITHOUT LIMIT; PUT AND THE LIBYANS WERE HER HELPERS

YET SHE BECAME AN EXILE; SHE WENT INTO CAPTIVITY; HER INFANTS WERE DASHED IN PIECES AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET; FOR HER HONORED MEN LOTS WERE CAST AND ALL HER GREAT MEN WERE BOUND IN CHAINS

YOU ALSO WILL BE DRUNKEN; YOU WILL GO INTO HIDING; YOU WILL SEEK A REFUGE FROM THE ENEMY

ALL YOUR FORTRESSES ARE LIKE FIG TREES WITH FIRSTRIPE FIGSIF SHAKEN THEY FALL INTO THE MOUTH OF THE EATER

BEHOLD YOUR TROOPS ARE WOMEN IN YOUR MIDST

THE GATES OF YOUR LAND ARE WIDE OPEN TO YOUR ENEMIES; FIRE HAS DEVOURED YOUR BARS

DRAW WATER FOR THE SIEGE; STRENGTHEN YOUR FORTS; GO INTO THE CLAY; TREAD THE MORTAR; TAKE HOLD OF THE BRICK MOLD

THERE WILL THE FIRE DEVOUR YOU; THE SWORD WILL CUT YOU OFF

IT WILL DEVOUR YOU LIKE THE LOCUST

MULTIPLY YOURSELVES LIKE THE LOCUST; MULTIPLY LIKE THE GRASSHOPPER

YOU INCREASED YOUR MERCHANTS MORE THAN THE STARS OF THE HEAVENS

THE LOCUST SPREADS ITS WINGS AND FLIES AWAY

YOUR PRINCES ARE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS YOUR SCRIBES LIKE CLOUDS OF LOCUSTS SETTLING ON THE FENCES IN A DAY OF COLDWHEN THE SUN RISES THEY FLY AWAY; NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE

YOUR SHEPHERDS ARE ASLEEP O KING OF ASSYRIA; YOUR NOBLES SLUMBER

YOUR PEOPLE ARE SCATTERED ON THE MOUNTAINS WITH NONE TO GATHER THEM

THERE IS NO EASING YOUR HURT; YOUR WOUND IS GRIEVOUS

ALL WHO HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT YOU CLAP THEIR HANDS OVER YOU

FOR UPON WHOM HAS NOT COME YOUR UNCEASING EVIL

JUDEJUDE A SERVANT OF JESUS CHRIST AND BROTHER OF JAMESTO THOSE WHO ARE CALLED BELOVED IN GOD THE FATHER AND KEPT FOR JESUS CHRIST MAY MERCY PEACE AND LOVE BE MULTIPLIED TO YOU

BELOVED ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY EAGER TO WRITE TO YOU ABOUT OUR COMMON SALVATION I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO WRITE APPEALING TO YOU TO CONTEND FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE FOR ALL DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS

FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE CREPT IN UNNOTICED WHO LONG AGO WERE DESIGNATED FOR THIS CONDEMNATION UNGODLY PEOPLE WHO PERVERT THE GRACE OF OUR GOD INTO SENSUALITY AND DENY OUR ONLY MASTER AND LORD JESUS CHRIST

NOW I WANT TO REMIND YOU ALTHOUGH YOU ONCE FULLY KNEW IT THAT JESUS WHO SAVED A PEOPLE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AFTERWARD DESTROYED THOSE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE

AND THE ANGELS WHO DID NOT STAY WITHIN THEIR OWN POSITION OF AUTHORITY BUT LEFT THEIR PROPER DWELLING HE HAS KEPT IN ETERNAL CHAINS UNDER GLOOMY DARKNESS UNTIL THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT DAY JUST AS SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND THE SURROUNDING CITIES WHICH LIKEWISE INDULGED IN SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND PURSUED UNNATURAL DESIRE SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE BY UNDERGOING A PUNISHMENT OF ETERNAL FIRE

YET IN LIKE MANNER THESE PEOPLE ALSO RELYING ON THEIR DREAMS DEFILE THE FLESH REJECT AUTHORITY AND BLASPHEME THE GLORIOUS ONES

BUT WHEN THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL CONTENDING WITH THE DEVIL WAS DISPUTING ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES HE DID NOT PRESUME TO PRONOUNCE A BLASPHEMOUS JUDGMENT BUT SAID THE LORD REBUKE YOU

 BUT THESE PEOPLE BLASPHEME ALL THAT THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEY ARE DESTROYED BY ALL THAT THEY LIKE UNREASONING ANIMALS UNDERSTAND INSTINCTIVELY

WOE TO THEM

FOR THEY WALKED IN THE WAY OF CAIN AND ABANDONED THEMSELVES FOR THE SAKE OF GAIN TO BALAAM'S ERROR AND PERISHED IN KORAH'S REBELLION

THESE ARE BLEMISHES ON YOUR LOVE FEASTS AS THEY FEAST WITH YOU WITHOUT FEAR LOOKING AFTER THEMSELVES; WATERLESS CLOUDS SWEPT ALONG BY WINDS; FRUITLESS TREES IN LATE AUTUMN TWICE DEAD UPROOTED; WILD WAVES OF THE SEA CASTING UP THE FOAM OF THEIR OWN SHAME; WANDERING STARS FOR WHOM THE GLOOM OF UTTER DARKNESS HAS BEEN RESERVED FOREVER

IT WAS ALSO ABOUT THESE THAT ENOCH THE SEVENTH FROM ADAM PROPHESIED SAYING BEHOLD THE LORD CAME WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF HIS HOLY ONES TO EXECUTE JUDGMENT ON ALL AND TO CONVICT ALL THE UNGODLY OF ALL THEIR DEEDS OF UNGODLINESS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED IN SUCH AN UNGODLY WAY AND OF ALL THE HARSH THINGS THAT UNGODLY SINNERS HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST HIM

 THESE ARE GRUMBLERS MALCONTENTS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN SINFUL DESIRES; THEY ARE LOUDMOUTHED BOASTERS SHOWING FAVORITISM TO GAIN ADVANTAGE

BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER BELOVED THE PREDICTIONS OF THE APOSTLES OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

THEY SAID TO YOU IN THE LAST TIME THERE WILL BE SCOFFERS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN UNGODLY PASSIONS

 IT IS THESE WHO CAUSE DIVISIONS WORLDLY PEOPLE DEVOID OF THE SPIRIT

BUT YOU BELOVED BUILD YOURSELVES UP IN YOUR MOST HOLY FAITH; PRAY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT; KEEP YOURSELVES IN THE LOVE OF GOD WAITING FOR THE MERCY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT LEADS TO ETERNAL LIFE

AND HAVE MERCY ON THOSE WHO DOUBT; SAVE OTHERS BY SNATCHING THEM OUT OF THE FIRE; TO OTHERS SHOW MERCY WITH FEAR HATING EVEN THE GARMENT STAINED BY THE FLESH

AMEN

 CHRONICLESSOLOMON THE SON OF DAVID ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN HIS KINGDOM AND THE LORD HIS GOD WAS WITH HIM AND MADE HIM EXCEEDINGLY GREAT

SOLOMON SPOKE TO ALL ISRAEL TO THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND OF HUNDREDS TO THE JUDGES AND TO ALL THE LEADERS IN ALL ISRAEL THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES

AND SOLOMON AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY WITH HIM WENT TO THE HIGH PLACE THAT WAS AT GIBEON FOR THE TENT OF MEETING OF GOD WHICH MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD HAD MADE IN THE WILDERNESS WAS THERE

BUT DAVID HAD BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF GOD FROM KIRIATHJEARIM TO THE PLACE THAT DAVID HAD PREPARED FOR IT FOR HE HAD PITCHED A TENT FOR IT IN JERUSALEM

 MOREOVER THE BRONZE ALTAR THAT BEZALEL THE SON OF URI SON OF HUR HAD MADE WAS THERE BEFORE THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD

AND SOLOMON AND THE ASSEMBLY RESORTED TO IT

AND SOLOMON WENT UP THERE TO THE BRONZE ALTAR BEFORE THE LORD WHICH WAS AT THE TENT OF MEETING AND OFFERED A THOUSAND BURNT OFFERINGS ON IT

IN THAT NIGHT GOD APPEARED TO SOLOMON AND SAID TO HIM ASK WHAT I SHALL GIVE YOU

 AND SOLOMON SAID TO GOD YOU HAVE SHOWN GREAT AND STEADFAST LOVE TO DAVID MY FATHER AND HAVE MADE ME KING IN HIS PLACE

O LORD GOD LET YOUR WORD TO DAVID MY FATHER BE NOW FULFILLED FOR YOU HAVE MADE ME KING OVER A PEOPLE AS NUMEROUS AS THE DUST OF THE EARTH

GIVE ME NOW WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE TO GO OUT AND COME IN BEFORE THIS PEOPLE FOR WHO CAN GOVERN THIS PEOPLE OF YOURS WHICH IS SO GREAT

 GOD ANSWERED SOLOMON BECAUSE THIS WAS IN YOUR HEART AND YOU HAVE NOT ASKED POSSESSIONS WEALTH HONOR OR THE LIFE OF THOSE WHO HATE YOU AND HAVE NOT EVEN ASKED LONG LIFE BUT HAVE ASKED WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU MAY GOVERN MY PEOPLE OVER WHOM I HAVE MADE YOU KING WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE ARE GRANTED TO YOU

I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU RICHES POSSESSIONS AND HONOR SUCH AS NONE OF THE KINGS HAD WHO WERE BEFORE YOU AND NONE AFTER YOU SHALL HAVE THE LIKE

 SO SOLOMON CAME FROM THE HIGH PLACE AT GIBEON FROM BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING TO JERUSALEM

AND HE REIGNED OVER ISRAEL

SOLOMON GATHERED TOGETHER CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN

HE HAD  CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN WHOM HE STATIONED IN THE CHARIOT CITIES AND WITH THE KING IN JERUSALEM

AND THE KING MADE SILVER AND GOLD AS COMMON IN JERUSALEM AS STONE AND HE MADE CEDAR AS PLENTIFUL AS THE SYCAMORE OF THE SHEPHELAH

AND SOLOMON'S IMPORT OF HORSES WAS FROM EGYPT AND KUE AND THE KING'S TRADERS WOULD BUY THEM FROM KUE FOR A PRICE

THEY IMPORTED A CHARIOT FROM EGYPT FOR  SHEKELS OF SILVER AND A HORSE FOR 

LIKEWISE THROUGH THEM THESE WERE EXPORTED TO ALL THE KINGS OF THE HITTITES AND THE KINGS OF SYRIA

NOW SOLOMON PURPOSED TO BUILD A TEMPLE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD AND A ROYAL PALACE FOR HIMSELF

AND SOLOMON ASSIGNED  MEN TO BEAR BURDENS AND  TO QUARRY IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND  TO OVERSEE THEM

AND SOLOMON SENT WORD TO HIRAM THE KING OF TYRE AS YOU DEALT WITH DAVID MY FATHER AND SENT HIM CEDAR TO BUILD HIMSELF A HOUSE TO DWELL IN SO DEAL WITH ME

BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD MY GOD AND DEDICATE IT TO HIM FOR THE BURNING OF INCENSE OF SWEET SPICES BEFORE HIM AND FOR THE REGULAR ARRANGEMENT OF THE SHOWBREAD AND FOR BURNT OFFERINGS MORNING AND EVENING ON THE SABBATHS AND THE NEW MOONS AND THE APPOINTED FEASTS OF THE LORD OUR GOD AS ORDAINED FOREVER FOR ISRAEL

THE HOUSE THAT I AM TO BUILD WILL BE GREAT FOR OUR GOD IS GREATER THAN ALL GODS

BUT WHO IS ABLE TO BUILD HIM A HOUSE SINCE HEAVEN EVEN HIGHEST HEAVEN CANNOT CONTAIN HIM

WHO AM I TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR HIM EXCEPT AS A PLACE TO MAKE OFFERINGS BEFORE HIM

SO NOW SEND ME A MAN SKILLED TO WORK IN GOLD SILVER BRONZE AND IRON AND IN PURPLE CRIMSON AND BLUE FABRICS TRAINED ALSO IN ENGRAVING TO BE WITH THE SKILLED WORKERS WHO ARE WITH ME IN JUDAH AND JERUSALEM WHOM DAVID MY FATHER PROVIDED

SEND ME ALSO CEDAR CYPRESS AND ALGUM TIMBER FROM LEBANON FOR I KNOW THAT YOUR SERVANTS KNOW HOW TO CUT TIMBER IN LEBANON

AND MY SERVANTS WILL BE WITH YOUR SERVANTS TO PREPARE TIMBER FOR ME IN ABUNDANCE FOR THE HOUSE I AM TO BUILD WILL BE GREAT AND WONDERFUL

I WILL GIVE FOR YOUR SERVANTS THE WOODSMEN WHO CUT TIMBER  CORS OF CRUSHED WHEAT  CORS OF BARLEY  BATHS OF WINE AND  BATHS OF OIL

 THEN HIRAM THE KING OF TYRE ANSWERED IN A LETTER THAT HE SENT TO SOLOMON BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES HIS PEOPLE HE HAS MADE YOU KING OVER THEM

 HIRAM ALSO SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH WHO HAS GIVEN KING DAVID A WISE SON WHO HAS DISCRETION AND UNDERSTANDING WHO WILL BUILD A TEMPLE FOR THE LORD AND A ROYAL PALACE FOR HIMSELF

NOW I HAVE SENT A SKILLED MAN WHO HAS UNDERSTANDING HURAMABI THE SON OF A WOMAN OF THE DAUGHTERS OF DAN AND HIS FATHER WAS A MAN OF TYRE

HE IS TRAINED TO WORK IN GOLD SILVER BRONZE IRON STONE AND WOOD AND IN PURPLE BLUE AND CRIMSON FABRICS AND FINE LINEN AND TO DO ALL SORTS OF ENGRAVING AND EXECUTE ANY DESIGN THAT MAY BE ASSIGNED HIM WITH YOUR CRAFTSMEN THE CRAFTSMEN OF MY LORD DAVID YOUR FATHER

AND WE WILL CUT WHATEVER TIMBER YOU NEED FROM LEBANON AND BRING IT TO YOU IN RAFTS BY SEA TO JOPPA SO THAT YOU MAY TAKE IT UP TO JERUSALEM

 THEN SOLOMON COUNTED ALL THE RESIDENT ALIENS WHO WERE IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL AFTER THE CENSUS OF THEM THAT DAVID HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN AND THERE WERE FOUND 

SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THEM HE ASSIGNED TO BEAR BURDENS  TO QUARRY IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND  AS OVERSEERS TO MAKE THE PEOPLE WORK

THEN SOLOMON BEGAN TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IN JERUSALEM ON MOUNT MORIAH WHERE THE LORD HAD APPEARED TO DAVID HIS FATHER AT THE PLACE THAT DAVID HAD APPOINTED ON THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ORNAN THE JEBUSITE

HE BEGAN TO BUILD IN THE SECOND MONTH OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN

THE WINGS OF THESE CHERUBIM EXTENDED TWENTY CUBITS

THE CHERUBIM STOOD ON THEIR FEET FACING THE NAVE

AND HE MADE THE VEIL OF BLUE AND PURPLE AND CRIMSON FABRICS AND FINE LINEN AND HE WORKED CHERUBIM ON IT

IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE MADE TWO PILLARS THIRTYFIVE CUBITS HIGH WITH A CAPITAL OF FIVE CUBITS ON THE TOP OF EACH

HE MADE CHAINS LIKE A NECKLACE AND PUT THEM ON THE TOPS OF THE PILLARS AND HE MADE A HUNDRED POMEGRANATES AND PUT THEM ON THE CHAINS

HE SET UP THE PILLARS IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE ONE ON THE SOUTH THE OTHER ON THE NORTH; THAT ON THE SOUTH HE CALLED JACHIN AND THAT ON THE NORTH BOAZ

HE MADE AN ALTAR OF BRONZE TWENTY CUBITS LONG AND TWENTY CUBITS WIDE AND TEN CUBITS HIGH

THEN HE MADE THE SEA OF CAST METAL

IT WAS ROUND TEN CUBITS FROM BRIM TO BRIM AND FIVE CUBITS HIGH AND A LINE OF THIRTY CUBITS MEASURED ITS CIRCUMFERENCE

THE GOURDS WERE IN TWO ROWS CAST WITH IT WHEN IT WAS CAST

IT STOOD ON TWELVE OXEN THREE FACING NORTH THREE FACING WEST THREE FACING SOUTH AND THREE FACING EAST

THE SEA WAS SET ON THEM AND ALL THEIR REAR PARTS WERE INWARD

ITS THICKNESS WAS A HANDBREADTH

AND ITS BRIM WAS MADE LIKE THE BRIM OF A CUP LIKE THE FLOWER OF A LILY

IT HELD  BATHS

HE ALSO MADE TEN BASINS IN WHICH TO WASH AND SET FIVE ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND FIVE ON THE NORTH SIDE

AND HE SET THE SEA AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE HOUSE

HIRAM ALSO MADE THE POTS THE SHOVELS AND THE BASINS

THE POTS THE SHOVELS THE FORKS AND ALL THE EQUIPMENT FOR THESE HURAMABI MADE OF BURNISHED BRONZE FOR KING SOLOMON FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

IN THE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN THE KING CAST THEM IN THE CLAY GROUND BETWEEN SUCCOTH AND ZEREDAH

SOLOMON MADE ALL THESE THINGS IN GREAT QUANTITIES FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE BRONZE WAS NOT SOUGHT

SO SOLOMON MADE ALL THE VESSELS THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD THE GOLDEN ALTAR THE TABLES FOR THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE THE LAMPSTANDS AND THEIR LAMPS OF PURE GOLD TO BURN BEFORE THE INNER SANCTUARY AS PRESCRIBED; THE FLOWERS THE LAMPS AND THE TONGS OF PUREST GOLD; THE SNUFFERS BASINS DISHES FOR INCENSE AND FIRE PANS OF PURE GOLD AND THE SOCKETS OF THE TEMPLE FOR THE INNER DOORS TO THE MOST HOLY PLACE AND FOR THE DOORS OF THE NAVE OF THE TEMPLE WERE OF GOLD

THUS ALL THE WORK THAT SOLOMON DID FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS FINISHED

AND SOLOMON BROUGHT IN THE THINGS THAT DAVID HIS FATHER HAD DEDICATED AND STORED THE SILVER THE GOLD AND ALL THE VESSELS IN THE TREASURIES OF THE HOUSE OF GOD

THEN SOLOMON ASSEMBLED THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND ALL THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES THE LEADERS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN JERUSALEM TO BRING UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD OUT OF THE CITY OF DAVID WHICH IS ZION

AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE KING AT THE FEAST THAT IS IN THE SEVENTH MONTH

AND ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME AND THE LEVITES TOOK UP THE ARK

AND THEY BROUGHT UP THE ARK THE TENT OF MEETING AND ALL THE HOLY VESSELS THAT WERE IN THE TENT; THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS BROUGHT THEM UP

AND KING SOLOMON AND ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL WHO HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE HIM WERE BEFORE THE ARK SACRIFICING SO MANY SHEEP AND OXEN THAT THEY COULD NOT BE COUNTED OR NUMBERED

THEN THE PRIESTS BROUGHT THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TO ITS PLACE IN THE INNER SANCTUARY OF THE HOUSE IN THE MOST HOLY PLACE UNDERNEATH THE WINGS OF THE CHERUBIM

THE CHERUBIM SPREAD OUT THEIR WINGS OVER THE PLACE OF THE ARK SO THAT THE CHERUBIM MADE A COVERING ABOVE THE ARK AND ITS POLES

AND THE POLES WERE SO LONG THAT THE ENDS OF THE POLES WERE SEEN FROM THE HOLY PLACE BEFORE THE INNER SANCTUARY BUT THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE

AND THEY ARE THERE TO THIS DAY

THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ARK EXCEPT THE TWO TABLETS THAT MOSES PUT THERE AT HOREB WHERE THE LORD MADE A COVENANT WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF EGYPT

AND WHEN THE PRIESTS CAME OUT OF THE HOLY PLACE FOR ALL THE PRIESTS WHO WERE PRESENT HAD CONSECRATED THEMSELVES WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR DIVISIONS AND ALL THE LEVITICAL SINGERS ASAPH HEMAN AND JEDUTHUN THEIR SONS AND KINSMEN ARRAYED IN FINE LINEN WITH CYMBALS HARPS AND LYRES STOOD EAST OF THE ALTAR WITH  PRIESTS WHO WERE TRUMPETERS; AND IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE TRUMPETERS AND SINGERS TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD IN UNISON IN PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING TO THE LORD AND WHEN THE SONG WAS RAISED WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS AND OTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN PRAISE TO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVERTHE HOUSE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS FILLED WITH A CLOUD SO THAT THE PRIESTS COULD NOT STAND TO MINISTER BECAUSE OF THE CLOUD FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE HOUSE OF GOD

THEN SOLOMON SAID THE LORD HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD DWELL IN THICK DARKNESS

BUT I HAVE BUILT YOU AN EXALTED HOUSE A PLACE FOR YOU TO DWELL IN FOREVER

 THEN THE KING TURNED AROUND AND BLESSED ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL WHILE ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL STOOD

AND HE SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO WITH HIS HAND HAS FULFILLED WHAT HE PROMISED WITH HIS MOUTH TO DAVID MY FATHER SAYING 'SINCE THE DAY THAT I BROUGHT MY PEOPLE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT I CHOSE NO CITY OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN WHICH TO BUILD A HOUSE THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE THERE AND I CHOSE NO MAN AS PRINCE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL; BUT I HAVE CHOSEN JERUSALEM THAT MY NAME MAY BE THERE AND I HAVE CHOSEN DAVID TO BE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' NOW IT WAS IN THE HEART OF DAVID MY FATHER TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

BUT THE LORD SAID TO DAVID MY FATHER 'WHEREAS IT WAS IN YOUR HEART TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR MY NAME YOU DID WELL THAT IT WAS IN YOUR HEART

NEVERTHELESS IT IS NOT YOU WHO SHALL BUILD THE HOUSE BUT YOUR SON WHO SHALL BE BORN TO YOU SHALL BUILD THE HOUSE FOR MY NAME

' NOW THE LORD HAS FULFILLED HIS PROMISE THAT HE MADE

FOR I HAVE RISEN IN THE PLACE OF DAVID MY FATHER AND SIT ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL AS THE LORD PROMISED AND I HAVE BUILT THE HOUSE FOR THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

AND THERE I HAVE SET THE ARK IN WHICH IS THE COVENANT OF THE LORD THAT HE MADE WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 THEN SOLOMON STOOD BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE LORD IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS

SOLOMON HAD MADE A BRONZE PLATFORM FIVE CUBITS LONG FIVE CUBITS WIDE AND THREE CUBITS HIGH AND HAD SET IT IN THE COURT AND HE STOOD ON IT

THEN HE KNELT ON HIS KNEES IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS TOWARD HEAVEN AND SAID O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL THERE IS NO GOD LIKE YOU IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTH KEEPING COVENANT AND SHOWING STEADFAST LOVE TO YOUR SERVANTS WHO WALK BEFORE YOU WITH ALL THEIR HEART WHO HAVE KEPT WITH YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER WHAT YOU DECLARED TO HIM

YOU SPOKE WITH YOUR MOUTH AND WITH YOUR HAND HAVE FULFILLED IT THIS DAY

NOW THEREFORE O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL KEEP FOR YOUR SERVANT DAVID MY FATHER WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED HIM SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT LACK A MAN TO SIT BEFORE ME ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL IF ONLY YOUR SONS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THEIR WAY TO WALK IN MY LAW AS YOU HAVE WALKED BEFORE ME

' NOW THEREFORE O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL LET YOUR WORD BE CONFIRMED WHICH YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO YOUR SERVANT DAVID

BUT WILL GOD INDEED DWELL WITH MAN ON THE EARTH

BEHOLD HEAVEN AND THE HIGHEST HEAVEN CANNOT CONTAIN YOU HOW MUCH LESS THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT

YET HAVE REGARD TO THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANT AND TO HIS PLEA O LORD MY GOD LISTENING TO THE CRY AND TO THE PRAYER THAT YOUR SERVANT PRAYS BEFORE YOU THAT YOUR EYES MAY BE OPEN DAY AND NIGHT TOWARD THIS HOUSE THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE PROMISED TO SET YOUR NAME THAT YOU MAY LISTEN TO THE PRAYER THAT YOUR SERVANT OFFERS TOWARD THIS PLACE

AND LISTEN TO THE PLEAS OF YOUR SERVANT AND OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL WHEN THEY PRAY TOWARD THIS PLACE

AND LISTEN FROM HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND WHEN YOU HEAR FORGIVE

IF A MAN SINS AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR AND IS MADE TO TAKE AN OATH AND COMES AND SWEARS HIS OATH BEFORE YOUR ALTAR IN THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND ACT AND JUDGE YOUR SERVANTS REPAYING THE GUILTY BY BRINGING HIS CONDUCT ON HIS OWN HEAD AND VINDICATING THE RIGHTEOUS BY REWARDING HIM ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS

IF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL ARE DEFEATED BEFORE THE ENEMY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU AND THEY TURN AGAIN AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NAME AND PRAY AND PLEAD WITH YOU IN THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND FORGIVE THE SIN OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND BRING THEM AGAIN TO THE LAND THAT YOU GAVE TO THEM AND TO THEIR FATHERS

WHEN HEAVEN IS SHUT UP AND THERE IS NO RAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU IF THEY PRAY TOWARD THIS PLACE AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NAME AND TURN FROM THEIR SIN WHEN YOU AFFLICT THEM THEN HEAR IN HEAVEN AND FORGIVE THE SIN OF YOUR SERVANTS YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL WHEN YOU TEACH THEM THE GOOD WAY IN WHICH THEY SHOULD WALK AND GRANT RAIN UPON YOUR LAND WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN TO YOUR PEOPLE AS AN INHERITANCE

IF THERE IS FAMINE IN THE LAND IF THERE IS PESTILENCE OR BLIGHT OR MILDEW OR LOCUST OR CATERPILLAR IF THEIR ENEMIES BESIEGE THEM IN THE LAND AT THEIR GATES WHATEVER PLAGUE WHATEVER SICKNESS THERE IS WHATEVER PRAYER WHATEVER PLEA IS MADE BY ANY MAN OR BY ALL YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL EACH KNOWING HIS OWN AFFLICTION AND HIS OWN SORROW AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TOWARD THIS HOUSE THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND FORGIVE AND RENDER TO EACH WHOSE HEART YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WAYS FOR YOU YOU ONLY KNOW THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND THAT THEY MAY FEAR YOU AND WALK IN YOUR WAYS ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY LIVE IN THE LAND THAT YOU GAVE TO OUR FATHERS

LIKEWISE WHEN A FOREIGNER WHO IS NOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL COMES FROM A FAR COUNTRY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR GREAT NAME AND YOUR MIGHTY HAND AND YOUR OUTSTRETCHED ARM WHEN HE COMES AND PRAYS TOWARD THIS HOUSE HEAR FROM HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND DO ACCORDING TO ALL FOR WHICH THE FOREIGNER CALLS TO YOU IN ORDER THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW YOUR NAME AND FEAR YOU AS DO YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT IS CALLED BY YOUR NAME

IF YOUR PEOPLE GO OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES BY WHATEVER WAY YOU SHALL SEND THEM AND THEY PRAY TO YOU TOWARD THIS CITY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT FOR YOUR NAME THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN THEIR PRAYER AND THEIR PLEA AND MAINTAIN THEIR CAUSE

IF THEY SIN AGAINST YOUFOR THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES NOT SINAND YOU ARE ANGRY WITH THEM AND GIVE THEM TO AN ENEMY SO THAT THEY ARE CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVE TO A LAND FAR OR NEAR YET IF THEY TURN THEIR HEART IN THE LAND TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED CAPTIVE AND REPENT AND PLEAD WITH YOU IN THE LAND OF THEIR CAPTIVITY SAYING 'WE HAVE SINNED AND HAVE ACTED PERVERSELY AND WICKEDLY' IF THEY REPENT WITH ALL THEIR MIND AND WITH ALL THEIR HEART IN THE LAND OF THEIR CAPTIVITY TO WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED CAPTIVE AND PRAY TOWARD THEIR LAND WHICH YOU GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS THE CITY THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT FOR YOUR NAME THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN YOUR DWELLING PLACE THEIR PRAYER AND THEIR PLEAS AND MAINTAIN THEIR CAUSE AND FORGIVE YOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

NOW O MY GOD LET YOUR EYES BE OPEN AND YOUR EARS ATTENTIVE TO THE PRAYER OF THIS PLACE

AND NOW ARISE O LORD GOD AND GO TO YOUR RESTING PLACE YOU AND THE ARK OF YOUR MIGHT

LET YOUR PRIESTS O LORD GOD BE CLOTHED WITH SALVATION AND LET YOUR SAINTS REJOICE IN YOUR GOODNESS

O LORD GOD DO NOT TURN AWAY THE FACE OF YOUR ANOINTED ONE

REMEMBER YOUR STEADFAST LOVE FOR DAVID YOUR SERVANT

AS SOON AS SOLOMON FINISHED HIS PRAYER FIRE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUMED THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE SACRIFICES AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TEMPLE

AND THE PRIESTS COULD NOT ENTER THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BECAUSE THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE LORD'S HOUSE

WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAW THE FIRE COME DOWN AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD ON THE TEMPLE THEY BOWED DOWN WITH THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND ON THE PAVEMENT AND WORSHIPED AND GAVE THANKS TO THE LORD SAYING FOR HE IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

 THEN THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OFFERED SACRIFICE BEFORE THE LORD

KING SOLOMON OFFERED AS A SACRIFICE  OXEN AND  SHEEP

SO THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE DEDICATED THE HOUSE OF GOD

THE PRIESTS STOOD AT THEIR POSTS; THE LEVITES ALSO WITH THE INSTRUMENTS FOR MUSIC TO THE LORD THAT KING DAVID HAD MADE FOR GIVING THANKS TO THE LORDFOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVERWHENEVER DAVID OFFERED PRAISES BY THEIR MINISTRY; OPPOSITE THEM THE PRIESTS SOUNDED TRUMPETS AND ALL ISRAEL STOOD

AND SOLOMON CONSECRATED THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT THAT WAS BEFORE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOR THERE HE OFFERED THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE FAT OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS BECAUSE THE BRONZE ALTAR SOLOMON HAD MADE COULD NOT HOLD THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE GRAIN OFFERING AND THE FAT

AT THAT TIME SOLOMON HELD THE FEAST FOR SEVEN DAYS AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM A VERY GREAT ASSEMBLY FROM LEBOHAMATH TO THE BROOK OF EGYPT

AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THEY HELD A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY FOR THEY HAD KEPT THE DEDICATION OF THE ALTAR SEVEN DAYS AND THE FEAST SEVEN DAYS

ON THE TWENTYTHIRD DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH HE SENT THE PEOPLE AWAY TO THEIR HOMES JOYFUL AND GLAD OF HEART FOR THE PROSPERITY THAT THE LORD HAD GRANTED TO DAVID AND TO SOLOMON AND TO ISRAEL HIS PEOPLE

THUS SOLOMON FINISHED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE

ALL THAT SOLOMON HAD PLANNED TO DO IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND IN HIS OWN HOUSE HE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED

THEN THE LORD APPEARED TO SOLOMON IN THE NIGHT AND SAID TO HIM I HAVE HEARD YOUR PRAYER AND HAVE CHOSEN THIS PLACE FOR MYSELF AS A HOUSE OF SACRIFICE

WHEN I SHUT UP THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE IS NO RAIN OR COMMAND THE LOCUST TO DEVOUR THE LAND OR SEND PESTILENCE AMONG MY PEOPLE IF MY PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY AND SEEK MY FACE AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS THEN I WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND WILL FORGIVE THEIR SIN AND HEAL THEIR LAND

NOW MY EYES WILL BE OPEN AND MY EARS ATTENTIVE TO THE PRAYER THAT IS MADE IN THIS PLACE

FOR NOW I HAVE CHOSEN AND CONSECRATED THIS HOUSE THAT MY NAME MAY BE THERE FOREVER

MY EYES AND MY HEART WILL BE THERE FOR ALL TIME

AND AS FOR YOU IF YOU WILL WALK BEFORE ME AS DAVID YOUR FATHER WALKED DOING ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU AND KEEPING MY STATUTES AND MY RULES THEN I WILL ESTABLISH YOUR ROYAL THRONE AS I COVENANTED WITH DAVID YOUR FATHER SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT LACK A MAN TO RULE ISRAEL

' BUT IF YOU TURN ASIDE AND FORSAKE MY STATUTES AND MY COMMANDMENTS THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE YOU AND GO AND SERVE OTHER GODS AND WORSHIP THEM THEN I WILL PLUCK YOU UP FROM MY LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU AND THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE CONSECRATED FOR MY NAME I WILL CAST OUT OF MY SIGHT AND I WILL MAKE IT A PROVERB AND A BYWORD AMONG ALL PEOPLES

AND AT THIS HOUSE WHICH WAS EXALTED EVERYONE PASSING BY WILL BE ASTONISHED AND SAY 'WHY HAS THE LORD DONE THUS TO THIS LAND AND TO THIS HOUSE

' THEN THEY WILL SAY 'BECAUSE THEY ABANDONED THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS WHO BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND LAID HOLD ON OTHER GODS AND WORSHIPED THEM AND SERVED THEM

THEREFORE HE HAS BROUGHT ALL THIS DISASTER ON THEM

'AT THE END OF TWENTY YEARS IN WHICH SOLOMON HAD BUILT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND HIS OWN HOUSE SOLOMON REBUILT THE CITIES THAT HIRAM HAD GIVEN TO HIM AND SETTLED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN THEM

AND SOLOMON WENT TO HAMATHZOBAH AND TOOK IT

HE BUILT TADMOR IN THE WILDERNESS AND ALL THE STORE CITIES THAT HE BUILT IN HAMATH

HE ALSO BUILT UPPER BETHHORON AND LOWER BETHHORON FORTIFIED CITIES WITH WALLS GATES AND BARS AND BAALATH AND ALL THE STORE CITIES THAT SOLOMON HAD AND ALL THE CITIES FOR HIS CHARIOTS AND THE CITIES FOR HIS HORSEMEN AND WHATEVER SOLOMON DESIRED TO BUILD IN JERUSALEM IN LEBANON AND IN ALL THE LAND OF HIS DOMINION

ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT OF THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES WHO WERE NOT OF ISRAEL FROM THEIR DESCENDANTS WHO WERE LEFT AFTER THEM IN THE LAND WHOM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD NOT DESTROYEDTHESE SOLOMON DRAFTED AS FORCED LABOR AND SO THEY ARE TO THIS DAY

BUT OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SOLOMON MADE NO SLAVES FOR HIS WORK; THEY WERE SOLDIERS AND HIS OFFICERS THE COMMANDERS OF HIS CHARIOTS AND HIS HORSEMEN

AND THESE WERE THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF KING SOLOMON  WHO EXERCISED AUTHORITY OVER THE PEOPLE

SOLOMON BROUGHT PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER UP FROM THE CITY OF DAVID TO THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD BUILT FOR HER FOR HE SAID MY WIFE SHALL NOT LIVE IN THE HOUSE OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL FOR THE PLACES TO WHICH THE ARK OF THE LORD HAS COME ARE HOLY

 THEN SOLOMON OFFERED UP BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD ON THE ALTAR OF THE LORD THAT HE HAD BUILT BEFORE THE VESTIBULE AS THE DUTY OF EACH DAY REQUIRED OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF MOSES FOR THE SABBATHS THE NEW MOONS AND THE THREE ANNUAL FEASTSTHE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD THE FEAST OF WEEKS AND THE FEAST OF BOOTHS

ACCORDING TO THE RULING OF DAVID HIS FATHER HE APPOINTED THE DIVISIONS OF THE PRIESTS FOR THEIR SERVICE AND THE LEVITES FOR THEIR OFFICES OF PRAISE AND MINISTRY BEFORE THE PRIESTS AS THE DUTY OF EACH DAY REQUIRED AND THE GATEKEEPERS IN THEIR DIVISIONS AT EACH GATE FOR SO DAVID THE MAN OF GOD HAD COMMANDED

AND THEY DID NOT TURN ASIDE FROM WHAT THE KING HAD COMMANDED THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES CONCERNING ANY MATTER AND CONCERNING THE TREASURIES

THUS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THE WORK OF SOLOMON FROM THE DAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS LAID UNTIL IT WAS FINISHED

SO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS COMPLETED

THEN SOLOMON WENT TO EZIONGEBER AND ELOTH ON THE SHORE OF THE SEA IN THE LAND OF EDOM

AND HIRAM SENT TO HIM BY THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS SHIPS AND SERVANTS FAMILIAR WITH THE SEA AND THEY WENT TO OPHIR TOGETHER WITH THE SERVANTS OF SOLOMON AND BROUGHT FROM THERE  TALENTS OF GOLD AND BROUGHT IT TO KING SOLOMON

NOW WHEN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HEARD OF THE FAME OF SOLOMON SHE CAME TO JERUSALEM TO TEST HIM WITH HARD QUESTIONS HAVING A VERY GREAT RETINUE AND CAMELS BEARING SPICES AND VERY MUCH GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES

AND WHEN SHE CAME TO SOLOMON SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT WAS ON HER MIND

AND SOLOMON ANSWERED ALL HER QUESTIONS

THERE WAS NOTHING HIDDEN FROM SOLOMON THAT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO HER

AND WHEN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HAD SEEN THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD BUILT THE FOOD OF HIS TABLE THE SEATING OF HIS OFFICIALS AND THE ATTENDANCE OF HIS SERVANTS AND THEIR CLOTHING HIS CUPBEARERS AND THEIR CLOTHING AND HIS BURNT OFFERINGS THAT HE OFFERED AT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THERE WAS NO MORE BREATH IN HER

AND SHE SAID TO THE KING THE REPORT WAS TRUE THAT I HEARD IN MY OWN LAND OF YOUR WORDS AND OF YOUR WISDOM BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE THE REPORTS UNTIL I CAME AND MY OWN EYES HAD SEEN IT

AND BEHOLD HALF THE GREATNESS OF YOUR WISDOM WAS NOT TOLD ME; YOU SURPASS THE REPORT THAT I HEARD

HAPPY ARE YOUR WIVES

HAPPY ARE THESE YOUR SERVANTS WHO CONTINUALLY STAND BEFORE YOU AND HEAR YOUR WISDOM

BLESSED BE THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS DELIGHTED IN YOU AND SET YOU ON HIS THRONE AS KING FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD

BECAUSE YOUR GOD LOVED ISRAEL AND WOULD ESTABLISH THEM FOREVER HE HAS MADE YOU KING OVER THEM THAT YOU MAY EXECUTE JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS

 THEN SHE GAVE THE KING  TALENTS OF GOLD AND A VERY GREAT QUANTITY OF SPICES AND PRECIOUS STONES

THERE WERE NO SPICES SUCH AS THOSE THAT THE QUEEN OF SHEBA GAVE TO KING SOLOMON

MOREOVER THE SERVANTS OF HIRAM AND THE SERVANTS OF SOLOMON WHO BROUGHT GOLD FROM OPHIR BROUGHT ALGUM WOOD AND PRECIOUS STONES

AND THE KING MADE FROM THE ALGUM WOOD SUPPORTS FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND FOR THE KING'S HOUSE LYRES ALSO AND HARPS FOR THE SINGERS

THERE NEVER WAS SEEN THE LIKE OF THEM BEFORE IN THE LAND OF JUDAH

AND KING SOLOMON GAVE TO THE QUEEN OF SHEBA ALL THAT SHE DESIRED WHATEVER SHE ASKED BESIDES WHAT SHE HAD BROUGHT TO THE KING

SO SHE TURNED AND WENT BACK TO HER OWN LAND WITH HER SERVANTS

NOW THE WEIGHT OF GOLD THAT CAME TO SOLOMON IN ONE YEAR WAS  TALENTS OF GOLD BESIDES THAT WHICH THE EXPLORERS AND MERCHANTS BROUGHT

AND ALL THE KINGS OF ARABIA AND THE GOVERNORS OF THE LAND BROUGHT GOLD AND SILVER TO SOLOMON

KING SOLOMON MADE  LARGE SHIELDS OF BEATEN GOLD;  SHEKELS OF BEATEN GOLD WENT INTO EACH SHIELD

AND HE MADE  SHIELDS OF BEATEN GOLD;  SHEKELS OF GOLD WENT INTO EACH SHIELD; AND THE KING PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON

THE KING ALSO MADE A GREAT IVORY THRONE AND OVERLAID IT WITH PURE GOLD

THE THRONE HAD SIX STEPS AND A FOOTSTOOL OF GOLD WHICH WERE ATTACHED TO THE THRONE AND ON EACH SIDE OF THE SEAT WERE ARM RESTS AND TWO LIONS STANDING BESIDE THE ARM RESTS WHILE TWELVE LIONS STOOD THERE ONE ON EACH END OF A STEP ON THE SIX STEPS

NOTHING LIKE IT WAS EVER MADE FOR ANY KINGDOM

ALL KING SOLOMON'S DRINKING VESSELS WERE OF GOLD AND ALL THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON WERE OF PURE GOLD

SILVER WAS NOT CONSIDERED AS ANYTHING IN THE DAYS OF SOLOMON

FOR THE KING'S SHIPS WENT TO TARSHISH WITH THE SERVANTS OF HIRAM

ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS THE SHIPS OF TARSHISH USED TO COME BRINGING GOLD SILVER IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS

THUS KING SOLOMON EXCELLED ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH IN RICHES AND IN WISDOM

AND ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SOUGHT THE PRESENCE OF SOLOMON TO HEAR HIS WISDOM WHICH GOD HAD PUT INTO HIS MIND

EVERY ONE OF THEM BROUGHT HIS PRESENT ARTICLES OF SILVER AND OF GOLD GARMENTS MYRRH SPICES HORSES AND MULES SO MUCH YEAR BY YEAR

AND SOLOMON HAD  STALLS FOR HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN WHOM HE STATIONED IN THE CHARIOT CITIES AND WITH THE KING IN JERUSALEM

AND HE RULED OVER ALL THE KINGS FROM THE EUPHRATES TO THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND TO THE BORDER OF EGYPT

AND THE KING MADE SILVER AS COMMON IN JERUSALEM AS STONE AND HE MADE CEDAR AS PLENTIFUL AS THE SYCAMORE OF THE SHEPHELAH

AND HORSES WERE IMPORTED FOR SOLOMON FROM EGYPT AND FROM ALL LANDS

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF SOLOMON FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY OF NATHAN THE PROPHET AND IN THE PROPHECY OF AHIJAH THE SHILONITE AND IN THE VISIONS OF IDDO THE SEER CONCERNING JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT

SOLOMON REIGNED IN JERUSALEM OVER ALL ISRAEL FORTY YEARS

AND SOLOMON SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND REHOBOAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

REHOBOAM WENT TO SHECHEM FOR ALL ISRAEL HAD COME TO SHECHEM TO MAKE HIM KING

AND AS SOON AS JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT HEARD OF IT FOR HE WAS IN EGYPT WHERE HE HAD FLED FROM KING SOLOMON THEN JEROBOAM RETURNED FROM EGYPT

AND THEY SENT AND CALLED HIM

AND JEROBOAM AND ALL ISRAEL CAME AND SAID TO REHOBOAM YOUR FATHER MADE OUR YOKE HEAVY

NOW THEREFORE LIGHTEN THE HARD SERVICE OF YOUR FATHER AND HIS HEAVY YOKE ON US AND WE WILL SERVE YOU

 HE SAID TO THEM COME TO ME AGAIN IN THREE DAYS

 SO THE PEOPLE WENT AWAY

THEN KING REHOBOAM TOOK COUNSEL WITH THE OLD MEN WHO HAD STOOD BEFORE SOLOMON HIS FATHER WHILE HE WAS YET ALIVE SAYING HOW DO YOU ADVISE ME TO ANSWER THIS PEOPLE

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM IF YOU WILL BE GOOD TO THIS PEOPLE AND PLEASE THEM AND SPEAK GOOD WORDS TO THEM THEN THEY WILL BE YOUR SERVANTS FOREVER

 BUT HE ABANDONED THE COUNSEL THAT THE OLD MEN GAVE HIM AND TOOK COUNSEL WITH THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM AND STOOD BEFORE HIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHAT DO YOU ADVISE THAT WE ANSWER THIS PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID TO ME 'LIGHTEN THE YOKE THAT YOUR FATHER PUT ON US'

 AND THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM SAID TO HIM THUS SHALL YOU SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAID TO YOU 'YOUR FATHER MADE OUR YOKE HEAVY BUT YOU LIGHTEN IT FOR US'; THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THEM 'MY LITTLE FINGER IS THICKER THAN MY FATHER'S THIGHS

AND NOW WHEREAS MY FATHER LAID ON YOU A HEAVY YOKE I WILL ADD TO YOUR YOKE

MY FATHER DISCIPLINED YOU WITH WHIPS BUT I WILL DISCIPLINE YOU WITH SCORPIONS

' SO JEROBOAM AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO REHOBOAM THE THIRD DAY AS THE KING SAID COME TO ME AGAIN THE THIRD DAY

 AND THE KING ANSWERED THEM HARSHLY; AND FORSAKING THE COUNSEL OF THE OLD MEN KING REHOBOAM SPOKE TO THEM ACCORDING TO THE COUNSEL OF THE YOUNG MEN SAYING MY FATHER MADE YOUR YOKE HEAVY BUT I WILL ADD TO IT

MY FATHER DISCIPLINED YOU WITH WHIPS BUT I WILL DISCIPLINE YOU WITH SCORPIONS

 SO THE KING DID NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE FOR IT WAS A TURN OF AFFAIRS BROUGHT ABOUT BY GOD THAT THE LORD MIGHT FULFILL HIS WORD WHICH HE SPOKE BY AHIJAH THE SHILONITE TO JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT

AND WHEN ALL ISRAEL SAW THAT THE KING DID NOT LISTEN TO THEM THE PEOPLE ANSWERED THE KING WHAT PORTION HAVE WE IN DAVID

WE HAVE NO INHERITANCE IN THE SON OF JESSE

EACH OF YOU TO YOUR TENTS O ISRAEL

LOOK NOW TO YOUR OWN HOUSE DAVID

 SO ALL ISRAEL WENT TO THEIR TENTS

BUT REHOBOAM REIGNED OVER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH

THEN KING REHOBOAM SENT HADORAM WHO WAS TASKMASTER OVER THE FORCED LABOR AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES

AND KING REHOBOAM QUICKLY MOUNTED HIS CHARIOT TO FLEE TO JERUSALEM

SO ISRAEL HAS BEEN IN REBELLION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF DAVID TO THIS DAY

WHEN REHOBOAM CAME TO JERUSALEM HE ASSEMBLED THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN  CHOSEN WARRIORS TO FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO REHOBOAM

BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO SHEMAIAH THE MAN OF GOD SAY TO REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON KING OF JUDAH AND TO ALL ISRAEL IN JUDAH AND BENJAMIN 'THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU SHALL NOT GO UP OR FIGHT AGAINST YOUR RELATIVES

RETURN EVERY MAN TO HIS HOME FOR THIS THING IS FROM ME

' SO THEY LISTENED TO THE WORD OF THE LORD AND RETURNED AND DID NOT GO AGAINST JEROBOAM

REHOBOAM LIVED IN JERUSALEM AND HE BUILT CITIES FOR DEFENSE IN JUDAH

HE BUILT BETHLEHEM ETAM TEKOA BETHZUR SOCO ADULLAM GATH MARESHAH ZIPH ADORAIM LACHISH AZEKAH ZORAH AIJALON AND HEBRON FORTIFIED CITIES THAT ARE IN JUDAH AND IN BENJAMIN

HE MADE THE FORTRESSES STRONG AND PUT COMMANDERS IN THEM AND STORES OF FOOD OIL AND WINE

AND HE PUT SHIELDS AND SPEARS IN ALL THE CITIES AND MADE THEM VERY STRONG

SO HE HELD JUDAH AND BENJAMIN

AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WHO WERE IN ALL ISRAEL PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HIM FROM ALL PLACES WHERE THEY LIVED

FOR THE LEVITES LEFT THEIR COMMON LANDS AND THEIR HOLDINGS AND CAME TO JUDAH AND JERUSALEM BECAUSE JEROBOAM AND HIS SONS CAST THEM OUT FROM SERVING AS PRIESTS OF THE LORD AND HE APPOINTED HIS OWN PRIESTS FOR THE HIGH PLACES AND FOR THE GOAT IDOLS AND FOR THE CALVES THAT HE HAD MADE

AND THOSE WHO HAD SET THEIR HEARTS TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL CAME AFTER THEM FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO JERUSALEM TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

THEY STRENGTHENED THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH AND FOR THREE YEARS THEY MADE REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON SECURE FOR THEY WALKED FOR THREE YEARS IN THE WAY OF DAVID AND SOLOMON

REHOBOAM TOOK AS WIFE MAHALATH THE DAUGHTER OF JERIMOTH THE SON OF DAVID AND OF ABIHAIL THE DAUGHTER OF ELIAB THE SON OF JESSE AND SHE BORE HIM SONS JEUSH SHEMARIAH AND ZAHAM

AFTER HER HE TOOK MAACAH THE DAUGHTER OF ABSALOM WHO BORE HIM ABIJAH ATTAI ZIZA AND SHELOMITH

REHOBOAM LOVED MAACAH THE DAUGHTER OF ABSALOM ABOVE ALL HIS WIVES AND CONCUBINES HE TOOK EIGHTEEN WIVES AND SIXTY CONCUBINES AND FATHERED TWENTYEIGHT SONS AND SIXTY DAUGHTERS

AND REHOBOAM APPOINTED ABIJAH THE SON OF MAACAH AS CHIEF PRINCE AMONG HIS BROTHERS FOR HE INTENDED TO MAKE HIM KING

AND HE DEALT WISELY AND DISTRIBUTED SOME OF HIS SONS THROUGH ALL THE DISTRICTS OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN IN ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES AND HE GAVE THEM ABUNDANT PROVISIONS AND PROCURED WIVES FOR THEM

WHEN THE RULE OF REHOBOAM WAS ESTABLISHED AND HE WAS STRONG HE ABANDONED THE LAW OF THE LORD AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM

IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF KING REHOBOAM BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO THE LORD SHISHAK KING OF EGYPT CAME UP AGAINST JERUSALEM WITH  CHARIOTS AND  HORSEMEN

AND THE PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT NUMBER WHO CAME WITH HIM FROM EGYPTLIBYANS SUKKIIM AND ETHIOPIANS

AND HE TOOK THE FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH AND CAME AS FAR AS JERUSALEM

THEN SHEMAIAH THE PROPHET CAME TO REHOBOAM AND TO THE PRINCES OF JUDAH WHO HAD GATHERED AT JERUSALEM BECAUSE OF SHISHAK AND SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD 'YOU ABANDONED ME SO I HAVE ABANDONED YOU TO THE HAND OF SHISHAK

' THEN THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL AND THE KING HUMBLED THEMSELVES AND SAID THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS

 WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT THEY HUMBLED THEMSELVES THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO SHEMAIAH THEY HAVE HUMBLED THEMSELVES

I WILL NOT DESTROY THEM BUT I WILL GRANT THEM SOME DELIVERANCE AND MY WRATH SHALL NOT BE POURED OUT ON JERUSALEM BY THE HAND OF SHISHAK

NEVERTHELESS THEY SHALL BE SERVANTS TO HIM THAT THEY MAY KNOW MY SERVICE AND THE SERVICE OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE COUNTRIES

 SO SHISHAK KING OF EGYPT CAME UP AGAINST JERUSALEM

HE TOOK AWAY THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE

HE TOOK AWAY EVERYTHING

HE ALSO TOOK AWAY THE SHIELDS OF GOLD THAT SOLOMON HAD MADE AND KING REHOBOAM MADE IN THEIR PLACE SHIELDS OF BRONZE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS OF THE GUARD WHO KEPT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S HOUSE

AND AS OFTEN AS THE KING WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GUARD CAME AND CARRIED THEM AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE GUARDROOM

AND WHEN HE HUMBLED HIMSELF THE WRATH OF THE LORD TURNED FROM HIM SO AS NOT TO MAKE A COMPLETE DESTRUCTION

MOREOVER CONDITIONS WERE GOOD IN JUDAH

SO KING REHOBOAM GREW STRONG IN JERUSALEM AND REIGNED

REHOBOAM WAS FORTYONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM THE CITY THAT THE LORD HAD CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO PUT HIS NAME THERE

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS NAAMAH THE AMMONITE

AND HE DID EVIL FOR HE DID NOT SET HIS HEART TO SEEK THE LORD

NOW THE ACTS OF REHOBOAM FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF SHEMAIAH THE PROPHET AND OF IDDO THE SEER

THERE WERE CONTINUAL WARS BETWEEN REHOBOAM AND JEROBOAM

AND REHOBOAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND ABIJAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF KING JEROBOAM ABIJAH BEGAN TO REIGN OVER JUDAH

HE REIGNED FOR THREE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS MICAIAH THE DAUGHTER OF URIEL OF GIBEAH

NOW THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN ABIJAH AND JEROBOAM

ABIJAH WENT OUT TO BATTLE HAVING AN ARMY OF VALIANT MEN OF WAR  CHOSEN MEN

AND JEROBOAM DREW UP HIS LINE OF BATTLE AGAINST HIM WITH  CHOSEN MIGHTY WARRIORS

THEN ABIJAH STOOD UP ON MOUNT ZEMARAIM THAT IS IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND SAID HEAR ME O JEROBOAM AND ALL ISRAEL

OUGHT YOU NOT TO KNOW THAT THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL GAVE THE KINGSHIP OVER ISRAEL FOREVER TO DAVID AND HIS SONS BY A COVENANT OF SALT

YET JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT A SERVANT OF SOLOMON THE SON OF DAVID ROSE UP AND REBELLED AGAINST HIS LORD AND CERTAIN WORTHLESS SCOUNDRELS GATHERED ABOUT HIM AND DEFIED REHOBOAM THE SON OF SOLOMON WHEN REHOBOAM WAS YOUNG AND IRRESOLUTE AND COULD NOT WITHSTAND THEM

AND NOW YOU THINK TO WITHSTAND THE KINGDOM OF THE LORD IN THE HAND OF THE SONS OF DAVID BECAUSE YOU ARE A GREAT MULTITUDE AND HAVE WITH YOU THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT JEROBOAM MADE YOU FOR GODS

HAVE YOU NOT DRIVEN OUT THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD THE SONS OF AARON AND THE LEVITES AND MADE PRIESTS FOR YOURSELVES LIKE THE PEOPLES OF OTHER LANDS

WHOEVER COMES FOR ORDINATION WITH A YOUNG BULL OR SEVEN RAMS BECOMES A PRIEST OF WHAT ARE NO GODS

BUT AS FOR US THE LORD IS OUR GOD AND WE HAVE NOT FORSAKEN HIM

WE HAVE PRIESTS MINISTERING TO THE LORD WHO ARE SONS OF AARON AND LEVITES FOR THEIR SERVICE

THEY OFFER TO THE LORD EVERY MORNING AND EVERY EVENING BURNT OFFERINGS AND INCENSE OF SWEET SPICES SET OUT THE SHOWBREAD ON THE TABLE OF PURE GOLD AND CARE FOR THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND THAT ITS LAMPS MAY BURN EVERY EVENING

FOR WE KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE LORD OUR GOD BUT YOU HAVE FORSAKEN HIM

BEHOLD GOD IS WITH US AT OUR HEAD AND HIS PRIESTS WITH THEIR BATTLE TRUMPETS TO SOUND THE CALL TO BATTLE AGAINST YOU

O SONS OF ISRAEL DO NOT FIGHT AGAINST THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS FOR YOU CANNOT SUCCEED

 JEROBOAM HAD SENT AN AMBUSH AROUND TO COME UPON THEM FROM BEHIND

THUS HIS TROOPS WERE IN FRONT OF JUDAH AND THE AMBUSH WAS BEHIND THEM

AND WHEN JUDAH LOOKED BEHOLD THE BATTLE WAS IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND THEM

AND THEY CRIED TO THE LORD AND THE PRIESTS BLEW THE TRUMPETS

THEN THE MEN OF JUDAH RAISED THE BATTLE SHOUT

AND WHEN THE MEN OF JUDAH SHOUTED GOD DEFEATED JEROBOAM AND ALL ISRAEL BEFORE ABIJAH AND JUDAH

THE MEN OF ISRAEL FLED BEFORE JUDAH AND GOD GAVE THEM INTO THEIR HAND

ABIJAH AND HIS PEOPLE STRUCK THEM WITH GREAT FORCE SO THERE FELL SLAIN OF ISRAEL  CHOSEN MEN

THUS THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE SUBDUED AT THAT TIME AND THE MEN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED ON THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

AND ABIJAH PURSUED JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH ITS VILLAGES AND JESHANAH WITH ITS VILLAGES AND EPHRON WITH ITS VILLAGES

JEROBOAM DID NOT RECOVER HIS POWER IN THE DAYS OF ABIJAH

AND THE LORD STRUCK HIM DOWN AND HE DIED

BUT ABIJAH GREW MIGHTY

AND HE TOOK FOURTEEN WIVES AND HAD TWENTYTWO SONS AND SIXTEEN DAUGHTERS

THE REST OF THE ACTS OF ABIJAH HIS WAYS AND HIS SAYINGS ARE WRITTEN IN THE STORY OF THE PROPHET IDDO

ABIJAH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID

AND ASA HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN HIS DAYS THE LAND HAD REST FOR TEN YEARS

AND ASA DID WHAT WAS GOOD AND RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD HIS GOD

HE TOOK AWAY THE FOREIGN ALTARS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BROKE DOWN THE PILLARS AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERIM AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO KEEP THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT

HE ALSO TOOK OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE INCENSE ALTARS

AND THE KINGDOM HAD REST UNDER HIM

HE BUILT FORTIFIED CITIES IN JUDAH FOR THE LAND HAD REST

HE HAD NO WAR IN THOSE YEARS FOR THE LORD GAVE HIM PEACE

AND HE SAID TO JUDAH LET US BUILD THESE CITIES AND SURROUND THEM WITH WALLS AND TOWERS GATES AND BARS

THE LAND IS STILL OURS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOUGHT THE LORD OUR GOD

WE HAVE SOUGHT HIM AND HE HAS GIVEN US PEACE ON EVERY SIDE

 SO THEY BUILT AND PROSPERED

AND ASA HAD AN ARMY OF  FROM JUDAH ARMED WITH LARGE SHIELDS AND SPEARS AND  MEN FROM BENJAMIN THAT CARRIED SHIELDS AND DREW BOWS

ALL THESE WERE MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR

ZERAH THE ETHIOPIAN CAME OUT AGAINST THEM WITH AN ARMY OF A MILLION MEN AND  CHARIOTS AND CAME AS FAR AS MARESHAH

AND ASA WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND THEY DREW UP THEIR LINES OF BATTLE IN THE VALLEY OF ZEPHATHAH AT MARESHAH

AND ASA CRIED TO THE LORD HIS GOD O LORD THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU TO HELP BETWEEN THE MIGHTY AND THE WEAK

HELP US O LORD OUR GOD FOR WE RELY ON YOU AND IN YOUR NAME WE HAVE COME AGAINST THIS MULTITUDE

O LORD YOU ARE OUR GOD; LET NOT MAN PREVAIL AGAINST YOU

 SO THE LORD DEFEATED THE ETHIOPIANS BEFORE ASA AND BEFORE JUDAH AND THE ETHIOPIANS FLED

ASA AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM PURSUED THEM AS FAR AS GERAR AND THE ETHIOPIANS FELL UNTIL NONE REMAINED ALIVE FOR THEY WERE BROKEN BEFORE THE LORD AND HIS ARMY

THE MEN OF JUDAH CARRIED AWAY VERY MUCH SPOIL

AND THEY ATTACKED ALL THE CITIES AROUND GERAR FOR THE FEAR OF THE LORD WAS UPON THEM

THEY PLUNDERED ALL THE CITIES FOR THERE WAS MUCH PLUNDER IN THEM

AND THEY STRUCK DOWN THE TENTS OF THOSE WHO HAD LIVESTOCK AND CARRIED AWAY SHEEP IN ABUNDANCE AND CAMELS

THEN THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME UPON AZARIAH THE SON OF ODED AND HE WENT OUT TO MEET ASA AND SAID TO HIM HEAR ME ASA AND ALL JUDAH AND BENJAMIN THE LORD IS WITH YOU WHILE YOU ARE WITH HIM

IF YOU SEEK HIM HE WILL BE FOUND BY YOU BUT IF YOU FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FORSAKE YOU

FOR A LONG TIME ISRAEL WAS WITHOUT THE TRUE GOD AND WITHOUT A TEACHING PRIEST AND WITHOUT LAW BUT WHEN IN THEIR DISTRESS THEY TURNED TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL AND SOUGHT HIM HE WAS FOUND BY THEM

IN THOSE TIMES THERE WAS NO PEACE TO HIM WHO WENT OUT OR TO HIM WHO CAME IN FOR GREAT DISTURBANCES AFFLICTED ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LANDS

THEY WERE BROKEN IN PIECES

NATION WAS CRUSHED BY NATION AND CITY BY CITY FOR GOD TROUBLED THEM WITH EVERY SORT OF DISTRESS

BUT YOU TAKE COURAGE

DO NOT LET YOUR HANDS BE WEAK FOR YOUR WORK SHALL BE REWARDED

 AS SOON AS ASA HEARD THESE WORDS THE PROPHECY OF AZARIAH THE SON OF ODED HE TOOK COURAGE AND PUT AWAY THE DETESTABLE IDOLS FROM ALL THE LAND OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN AND FROM THE CITIES THAT HE HAD TAKEN IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND HE REPAIRED THE ALTAR OF THE LORD THAT WAS IN FRONT OF THE VESTIBULE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE GATHERED ALL JUDAH AND BENJAMIN AND THOSE FROM EPHRAIM MANASSEH AND SIMEON WHO WERE RESIDING WITH THEM FOR GREAT NUMBERS HAD DESERTED TO HIM FROM ISRAEL WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE LORD HIS GOD WAS WITH HIM

THEY WERE GATHERED AT JERUSALEM IN THE THIRD MONTH OF THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF ASA

THEY SACRIFICED TO THE LORD ON THAT DAY FROM THE SPOIL THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT  OXEN AND  SHEEP

AND THEY ENTERED INTO A COVENANT TO SEEK THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS WITH ALL THEIR HEART AND WITH ALL THEIR SOUL BUT THAT WHOEVER WOULD NOT SEEK THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH WHETHER YOUNG OR OLD MAN OR WOMAN

THEY SWORE AN OATH TO THE LORD WITH A LOUD VOICE AND WITH SHOUTING AND WITH TRUMPETS AND WITH HORNS

AND ALL JUDAH REJOICED OVER THE OATH FOR THEY HAD SWORN WITH ALL THEIR HEART AND HAD SOUGHT HIM WITH THEIR WHOLE DESIRE AND HE WAS FOUND BY THEM AND THE LORD GAVE THEM REST ALL AROUND

EVEN MAACAH HIS MOTHER KING ASA REMOVED FROM BEING QUEEN MOTHER BECAUSE SHE HAD MADE A DETESTABLE IMAGE FOR ASHERAH

ASA CUT DOWN HER IMAGE CRUSHED IT AND BURNED IT AT THE BROOK KIDRON

BUT THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN OUT OF ISRAEL

NEVERTHELESS THE HEART OF ASA WAS WHOLLY TRUE ALL HIS DAYS

AND HE BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD THE SACRED GIFTS OF HIS FATHER AND HIS OWN SACRED GIFTS SILVER AND GOLD AND VESSELS

AND THERE WAS NO MORE WAR UNTIL THE THIRTYFIFTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF ASA

IN THE THIRTYSIXTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF ASA BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL WENT UP AGAINST JUDAH AND BUILT RAMAH THAT HE MIGHT PERMIT NO ONE TO GO OUT OR COME IN TO ASA KING OF JUDAH

THEN ASA TOOK SILVER AND GOLD FROM THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE AND SENT THEM TO BENHADAD KING OF SYRIA WHO LIVED IN DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU AS THERE WAS BETWEEN MY FATHER AND YOUR FATHER

BEHOLD I AM SENDING TO YOU SILVER AND GOLD

GO BREAK YOUR COVENANT WITH BAASHA KING OF ISRAEL THAT HE MAY WITHDRAW FROM ME

 AND BENHADAD LISTENED TO KING ASA AND SENT THE COMMANDERS OF HIS ARMIES AGAINST THE CITIES OF ISRAEL AND THEY CONQUERED IJON DAN ABELMAIM AND ALL THE STORE CITIES OF NAPHTALI

AND WHEN BAASHA HEARD OF IT HE STOPPED BUILDING RAMAH AND LET HIS WORK CEASE

THEN KING ASA TOOK ALL JUDAH AND THEY CARRIED AWAY THE STONES OF RAMAH AND ITS TIMBER WITH WHICH BAASHA HAD BEEN BUILDING AND WITH THEM HE BUILT GEBA AND MIZPAH

AT THAT TIME HANANI THE SEER CAME TO ASA KING OF JUDAH AND SAID TO HIM BECAUSE YOU RELIED ON THE KING OF SYRIA AND DID NOT RELY ON THE LORD YOUR GOD THE ARMY OF THE KING OF SYRIA HAS ESCAPED YOU

WERE NOT THE ETHIOPIANS AND THE LIBYANS A HUGE ARMY WITH VERY MANY CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN

YET BECAUSE YOU RELIED ON THE LORD HE GAVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND

FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD RUN TO AND FRO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH TO GIVE STRONG SUPPORT TO THOSE WHOSE HEART IS BLAMELESS TOWARD HIM

YOU HAVE DONE FOOLISHLY IN THIS FOR FROM NOW ON YOU WILL HAVE WARS

 THEN ASA WAS ANGRY WITH THE SEER AND PUT HIM IN THE STOCKS IN PRISON FOR HE WAS IN A RAGE WITH HIM BECAUSE OF THIS

AND ASA INFLICTED CRUELTIES UPON SOME OF THE PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME

THE ACTS OF ASA FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL

IN THE THIRTYNINTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN ASA WAS DISEASED IN HIS FEET AND HIS DISEASE BECAME SEVERE

YET EVEN IN HIS DISEASE HE DID NOT SEEK THE LORD BUT SOUGHT HELP FROM PHYSICIANS

AND ASA SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS DYING IN THE FORTYFIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN

THEY BURIED HIM IN THE TOMB THAT HE HAD CUT FOR HIMSELF IN THE CITY OF DAVID

THEY LAID HIM ON A BIER THAT HAD BEEN FILLED WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF SPICES PREPARED BY THE PERFUMER'S ART AND THEY MADE A VERY GREAT FIRE IN HIS HONOR

JEHOSHAPHAT HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE AND STRENGTHENED HIMSELF AGAINST ISRAEL

HE PLACED FORCES IN ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH AND SET GARRISONS IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND IN THE CITIES OF EPHRAIM THAT ASA HIS FATHER HAD CAPTURED

THE LORD WAS WITH JEHOSHAPHAT BECAUSE HE WALKED IN THE EARLIER WAYS OF HIS FATHER DAVID

HE DID NOT SEEK THE BAALS BUT SOUGHT THE GOD OF HIS FATHER AND WALKED IN HIS COMMANDMENTS AND NOT ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICES OF ISRAEL

THEREFORE THE LORD ESTABLISHED THE KINGDOM IN HIS HAND

AND ALL JUDAH BROUGHT TRIBUTE TO JEHOSHAPHAT AND HE HAD GREAT RICHES AND HONOR

HIS HEART WAS COURAGEOUS IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD

AND FURTHERMORE HE TOOK THE HIGH PLACES AND THE ASHERIM OUT OF JUDAH

IN THE THIRD YEAR OF HIS REIGN HE SENT HIS OFFICIALS BENHAIL OBADIAH ZECHARIAH NETHANEL AND MICAIAH TO TEACH IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH; AND WITH THEM THE LEVITES SHEMAIAH NETHANIAH ZEBADIAH ASAHEL SHEMIRAMOTH JEHONATHAN ADONIJAH TOBIJAH AND TOBADONIJAH; AND WITH THESE LEVITES THE PRIESTS ELISHAMA AND JEHORAM

AND THEY TAUGHT IN JUDAH HAVING THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF THE LORD WITH THEM

THEY WENT ABOUT THROUGH ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND TAUGHT AMONG THE PEOPLE

AND THE FEAR OF THE LORD FELL UPON ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE LANDS THAT WERE AROUND JUDAH AND THEY MADE NO WAR AGAINST JEHOSHAPHAT

SOME OF THE PHILISTINES BROUGHT JEHOSHAPHAT PRESENTS AND SILVER FOR TRIBUTE AND THE ARABIANS ALSO BROUGHT HIM  RAMS AND  GOATS

AND JEHOSHAPHAT GREW STEADILY GREATER

HE BUILT IN JUDAH FORTRESSES AND STORE CITIES AND HE HAD LARGE SUPPLIES IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH

HE HAD SOLDIERS MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR IN JERUSALEM

THIS WAS THE MUSTER OF THEM BY FATHERS' HOUSES OF JUDAH THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS ADNAH THE COMMANDER WITH  MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR; AND NEXT TO HIM JEHOHANAN THE COMMANDER WITH ; AND NEXT TO HIM AMASIAH THE SON OF ZICHRI A VOLUNTEER FOR THE SERVICE OF THE LORD WITH  MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR

OF BENJAMIN ELIADA A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR WITH  MEN ARMED WITH BOW AND SHIELD; AND NEXT TO HIM JEHOZABAD WITH  ARMED FOR WAR

THESE WERE IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING BESIDES THOSE WHOM THE KING HAD PLACED IN THE FORTIFIED CITIES THROUGHOUT ALL JUDAH

NOW JEHOSHAPHAT HAD GREAT RICHES AND HONOR AND HE MADE A MARRIAGE ALLIANCE WITH AHAB

AFTER SOME YEARS HE WENT DOWN TO AHAB IN SAMARIA

AND AHAB KILLED AN ABUNDANCE OF SHEEP AND OXEN FOR HIM AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND INDUCED HIM TO GO UP AGAINST RAMOTHGILEAD

AHAB KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO RAMOTHGILEAD

 HE ANSWERED HIM I AM AS YOU ARE MY PEOPLE AS YOUR PEOPLE

WE WILL BE WITH YOU IN THE WAR

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL INQUIRE FIRST FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD

 THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL GATHERED THE PROPHETS TOGETHER FOUR HUNDRED MEN AND SAID TO THEM SHALL WE GO TO BATTLE AGAINST RAMOTHGILEAD OR SHALL I REFRAIN

 AND THEY SAID GO UP FOR GOD WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF THE KING

 BUT JEHOSHAPHAT SAID IS THERE NOT HERE ANOTHER PROPHET OF THE LORD OF WHOM WE MAY INQUIRE

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT THERE IS YET ONE MAN BY WHOM WE MAY INQUIRE OF THE LORD MICAIAH THE SON OF IMLAH; BUT I HATE HIM FOR HE NEVER PROPHESIES GOOD CONCERNING ME BUT ALWAYS EVIL

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID LET NOT THE KING SAY SO

 THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL SUMMONED AN OFFICER AND SAID BRING QUICKLY MICAIAH THE SON OF IMLAH

 NOW THE KING OF ISRAEL AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH WERE SITTING ON THEIR THRONES ARRAYED IN THEIR ROBES

AND THEY WERE SITTING AT THE THRESHING FLOOR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF SAMARIA AND ALL THE PROPHETS WERE PROPHESYING BEFORE THEM

AND ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF CHENAANAH MADE FOR HIMSELF HORNS OF IRON AND SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD 'WITH THESE YOU SHALL PUSH THE SYRIANS UNTIL THEY ARE DESTROYED

' AND ALL THE PROPHETS PROPHESIED SO AND SAID GO UP TO RAMOTHGILEAD AND TRIUMPH

THE LORD WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF THE KING

 AND THE MESSENGER WHO WENT TO SUMMON MICAIAH SAID TO HIM BEHOLD THE WORDS OF THE PROPHETS WITH ONE ACCORD ARE FAVORABLE TO THE KING

LET YOUR WORD BE LIKE THE WORD OF ONE OF THEM AND SPEAK FAVORABLY

 BUT MICAIAH SAID AS THE LORD LIVES WHAT MY GOD SAYS THAT I WILL SPEAK

 AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO THE KING THE KING SAID TO HIM MICAIAH SHALL WE GO TO RAMOTHGILEAD TO BATTLE OR SHALL I REFRAIN

 AND HE ANSWERED GO UP AND TRIUMPH; THEY WILL BE GIVEN INTO YOUR HAND

 BUT THE KING SAID TO HIM HOW MANY TIMES SHALL I MAKE YOU SWEAR THAT YOU SPEAK TO ME NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

 AND HE SAID I SAW ALL ISRAEL SCATTERED ON THE MOUNTAINS AS SHEEP THAT HAVE NO SHEPHERD

AND THE LORD SAID 'THESE HAVE NO MASTER; LET EACH RETURN TO HIS HOME IN PEACE

' AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT HE WOULD NOT PROPHESY GOOD CONCERNING ME BUT EVIL

 AND MICAIAH SAID THEREFORE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD I SAW THE LORD SITTING ON HIS THRONE AND ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN STANDING ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT

AND THE LORD SAID 'WHO WILL ENTICE AHAB THE KING OF ISRAEL THAT HE MAY GO UP AND FALL AT RAMOTHGILEAD

' AND ONE SAID ONE THING AND ANOTHER SAID ANOTHER

THEN A SPIRIT CAME FORWARD AND STOOD BEFORE THE LORD SAYING 'I WILL ENTICE HIM

' AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM 'BY WHAT MEANS

' AND HE SAID 'I WILL GO OUT AND WILL BE A LYING SPIRIT IN THE MOUTH OF ALL HIS PROPHETS

' AND HE SAID 'YOU ARE TO ENTICE HIM AND YOU SHALL SUCCEED; GO OUT AND DO SO

' NOW THEREFORE BEHOLD THE LORD HAS PUT A LYING SPIRIT IN THE MOUTH OF THESE YOUR PROPHETS

THE LORD HAS DECLARED DISASTER CONCERNING YOU

 THEN ZEDEKIAH THE SON OF CHENAANAH CAME NEAR AND STRUCK MICAIAH ON THE CHEEK AND SAID WHICH WAY DID THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GO FROM ME TO SPEAK TO YOU

 AND MICAIAH SAID BEHOLD YOU SHALL SEE ON THAT DAY WHEN YOU GO INTO AN INNER CHAMBER TO HIDE YOURSELF

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID SEIZE MICAIAH AND TAKE HIM BACK TO AMON THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY AND TO JOASH THE KING'S SON AND SAY 'THUS SAYS THE KING PUT THIS FELLOW IN PRISON AND FEED HIM WITH MEAGER RATIONS OF BREAD AND WATER UNTIL I RETURN IN PEACE

' AND MICAIAH SAID IF YOU RETURN IN PEACE THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN BY ME

 AND HE SAID HEAR ALL YOU PEOPLES

 SO THE KING OF ISRAEL AND JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH WENT UP TO RAMOTHGILEAD

AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO JEHOSHAPHAT I WILL DISGUISE MYSELF AND GO INTO BATTLE BUT YOU WEAR YOUR ROBES

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL DISGUISED HIMSELF AND THEY WENT INTO BATTLE

NOW THE KING OF SYRIA HAD COMMANDED THE CAPTAINS OF HIS CHARIOTS FIGHT WITH NEITHER SMALL NOR GREAT BUT ONLY WITH THE KING OF ISRAEL

 AS SOON AS THE CAPTAINS OF THE CHARIOTS SAW JEHOSHAPHAT THEY SAID IT IS THE KING OF ISRAEL

 SO THEY TURNED TO FIGHT AGAINST HIM

AND JEHOSHAPHAT CRIED OUT AND THE LORD HELPED HIM; GOD DREW THEM AWAY FROM HIM

FOR AS SOON AS THE CAPTAINS OF THE CHARIOTS SAW THAT IT WAS NOT THE KING OF ISRAEL THEY TURNED BACK FROM PURSUING HIM

BUT A CERTAIN MAN DREW HIS BOW AT RANDOM AND STRUCK THE KING OF ISRAEL BETWEEN THE SCALE ARMOR AND THE BREASTPLATE

THEREFORE HE SAID TO THE DRIVER OF HIS CHARIOT TURN AROUND AND CARRY ME OUT OF THE BATTLE FOR I AM WOUNDED

 AND THE BATTLE CONTINUED THAT DAY AND THE KING OF ISRAEL WAS PROPPED UP IN HIS CHARIOT FACING THE SYRIANS UNTIL EVENING

THEN AT SUNSET HE DIED

JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH RETURNED IN SAFETY TO HIS HOUSE IN JERUSALEM

BUT JEHU THE SON OF HANANI THE SEER WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SAID TO KING JEHOSHAPHAT SHOULD YOU HELP THE WICKED AND LOVE THOSE WHO HATE THE LORD

BECAUSE OF THIS WRATH HAS GONE OUT AGAINST YOU FROM THE LORD

NEVERTHELESS SOME GOOD IS FOUND IN YOU FOR YOU DESTROYED THE ASHERAHS OUT OF THE LAND AND HAVE SET YOUR HEART TO SEEK GOD

 JEHOSHAPHAT LIVED AT JERUSALEM

AND HE WENT OUT AGAIN AMONG THE PEOPLE FROM BEERSHEBA TO THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

HE APPOINTED JUDGES IN THE LAND IN ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH CITY BY CITY AND SAID TO THE JUDGES CONSIDER WHAT YOU DO FOR YOU JUDGE NOT FOR MAN BUT FOR THE LORD

HE IS WITH YOU IN GIVING JUDGMENT

NOW THEN LET THE FEAR OF THE LORD BE UPON YOU

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO FOR THERE IS NO INJUSTICE WITH THE LORD OUR GOD OR PARTIALITY OR TAKING BRIBES

 MOREOVER IN JERUSALEM JEHOSHAPHAT APPOINTED CERTAIN LEVITES AND PRIESTS AND HEADS OF FAMILIES OF ISRAEL TO GIVE JUDGMENT FOR THE LORD AND TO DECIDE DISPUTED CASES

THEY HAD THEIR SEAT AT JERUSALEM

AND HE CHARGED THEM THUS YOU SHALL DO IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD IN FAITHFULNESS AND WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART WHENEVER A CASE COMES TO YOU FROM YOUR BROTHERS WHO LIVE IN THEIR CITIES CONCERNING BLOODSHED LAW OR COMMANDMENT STATUTES OR RULES THEN YOU SHALL WARN THEM THAT THEY MAY NOT INCUR GUILT BEFORE THE LORD AND WRATH MAY NOT COME UPON YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS

THUS YOU SHALL DO AND YOU WILL NOT INCUR GUILT

AND BEHOLD AMARIAH THE CHIEF PRIEST IS OVER YOU IN ALL MATTERS OF THE LORD; AND ZEBADIAH THE SON OF ISHMAEL THE GOVERNOR OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH IN ALL THE KING'S MATTERS AND THE LEVITES WILL SERVE YOU AS OFFICERS

DEAL COURAGEOUSLY AND MAY THE LORD BE WITH THE UPRIGHT

AFTER THIS THE MOABITES AND AMMONITES AND WITH THEM SOME OF THE MEUNITES CAME AGAINST JEHOSHAPHAT FOR BATTLE

SOME MEN CAME AND TOLD JEHOSHAPHAT A GREAT MULTITUDE IS COMING AGAINST YOU FROM EDOM FROM BEYOND THE SEA; AND BEHOLD THEY ARE IN HAZAZONTAMAR THAT IS ENGEDI

THEN JEHOSHAPHAT WAS AFRAID AND SET HIS FACE TO SEEK THE LORD AND PROCLAIMED A FAST THROUGHOUT ALL JUDAH

AND JUDAH ASSEMBLED TO SEEK HELP FROM THE LORD; FROM ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THEY CAME TO SEEK THE LORD

AND JEHOSHAPHAT STOOD IN THE ASSEMBLY OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BEFORE THE NEW COURT AND SAID O LORD GOD OF OUR FATHERS ARE YOU NOT GOD IN HEAVEN

YOU RULE OVER ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE NATIONS

IN YOUR HAND ARE POWER AND MIGHT SO THAT NONE IS ABLE TO WITHSTAND YOU

DID YOU NOT OUR GOD DRIVE OUT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND BEFORE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND GIVE IT FOREVER TO THE DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM YOUR FRIEND

AND THEY HAVE LIVED IN IT AND HAVE BUILT FOR YOU IN IT A SANCTUARY FOR YOUR NAME SAYING 'IF DISASTER COMES UPON US THE SWORD JUDGMENT OR PESTILENCE OR FAMINE WE WILL STAND BEFORE THIS HOUSE AND BEFORE YOUFOR YOUR NAME IS IN THIS HOUSEAND CRY OUT TO YOU IN OUR AFFLICTION AND YOU WILL HEAR AND SAVE

' AND NOW BEHOLD THE MEN OF AMMON AND MOAB AND MOUNT SEIR WHOM YOU WOULD NOT LET ISRAEL INVADE WHEN THEY CAME FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT AND WHOM THEY AVOIDED AND DID NOT DESTROY BEHOLD THEY REWARD US BY COMING TO DRIVE US OUT OF YOUR POSSESSION WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN US TO INHERIT

O OUR GOD WILL YOU NOT EXECUTE JUDGMENT ON THEM

FOR WE ARE POWERLESS AGAINST THIS GREAT HORDE THAT IS COMING AGAINST US

WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT OUR EYES ARE ON YOU

 MEANWHILE ALL JUDAH STOOD BEFORE THE LORD WITH THEIR LITTLE ONES THEIR WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN

AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD CAME UPON JAHAZIEL THE SON OF ZECHARIAH SON OF BENAIAH SON OF JEIEL SON OF MATTANIAH A LEVITE OF THE SONS OF ASAPH IN THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND HE SAID LISTEN ALL JUDAH AND INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND KING JEHOSHAPHAT THUS SAYS THE LORD TO YOU 'DO NOT BE AFRAID AND DO NOT BE DISMAYED AT THIS GREAT HORDE FOR THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS BUT GOD'S

TOMORROW GO DOWN AGAINST THEM

BEHOLD THEY WILL COME UP BY THE ASCENT OF ZIZ

YOU WILL FIND THEM AT THE END OF THE VALLEY EAST OF THE WILDERNESS OF JERUEL

YOU WILL NOT NEED TO FIGHT IN THIS BATTLE

STAND FIRM HOLD YOUR POSITION AND SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD ON YOUR BEHALF O JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

' DO NOT BE AFRAID AND DO NOT BE DISMAYED

TOMORROW GO OUT AGAINST THEM AND THE LORD WILL BE WITH YOU

 THEN JEHOSHAPHAT BOWED HIS HEAD WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FELL DOWN BEFORE THE LORD WORSHIPING THE LORD

AND THE LEVITES OF THE KOHATHITES AND THE KORAHITES STOOD UP TO PRAISE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WITH A VERY LOUD VOICE

AND THEY ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WENT OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS OF TEKOA

AND WHEN THEY WENT OUT JEHOSHAPHAT STOOD AND SAID HEAR ME JUDAH AND INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

BELIEVE IN THE LORD YOUR GOD AND YOU WILL BE ESTABLISHED; BELIEVE HIS PROPHETS AND YOU WILL SUCCEED

 AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN COUNSEL WITH THE PEOPLE HE APPOINTED THOSE WHO WERE TO SING TO THE LORD AND PRAISE HIM IN HOLY ATTIRE AS THEY WENT BEFORE THE ARMY AND SAY GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER

 AND WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SING AND PRAISE THE LORD SET AN AMBUSH AGAINST THE MEN OF AMMON MOAB AND MOUNT SEIR WHO HAD COME AGAINST JUDAH SO THAT THEY WERE ROUTED

FOR THE MEN OF AMMON AND MOAB ROSE AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF MOUNT SEIR DEVOTING THEM TO DESTRUCTION AND WHEN THEY HAD MADE AN END OF THE INHABITANTS OF SEIR THEY ALL HELPED TO DESTROY ONE ANOTHER

WHEN JUDAH CAME TO THE WATCHTOWER OF THE WILDERNESS THEY LOOKED TOWARD THE HORDE AND BEHOLD THERE WERE DEAD BODIES LYING ON THE GROUND; NONE HAD ESCAPED

WHEN JEHOSHAPHAT AND HIS PEOPLE CAME TO TAKE THEIR SPOIL THEY FOUND AMONG THEM IN GREAT NUMBERS GOODS CLOTHING AND PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH THEY TOOK FOR THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY COULD CARRY NO MORE

THEY WERE THREE DAYS IN TAKING THE SPOIL IT WAS SO MUCH

ON THE FOURTH DAY THEY ASSEMBLED IN THE VALLEY OF BERACAH FOR THERE THEY BLESSED THE LORD

THEREFORE THE NAME OF THAT PLACE HAS BEEN CALLED THE VALLEY OF BERACAH TO THIS DAY

THEN THEY RETURNED EVERY MAN OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM AND JEHOSHAPHAT AT THEIR HEAD RETURNING TO JERUSALEM WITH JOY FOR THE LORD HAD MADE THEM REJOICE OVER THEIR ENEMIES

THEY CAME TO JERUSALEM WITH HARPS AND LYRES AND TRUMPETS TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE FEAR OF GOD CAME ON ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE COUNTRIES WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE LORD HAD FOUGHT AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF ISRAEL

SO THE REALM OF JEHOSHAPHAT WAS QUIET FOR HIS GOD GAVE HIM REST ALL AROUND

THUS JEHOSHAPHAT REIGNED OVER JUDAH

HE WAS THIRTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWENTYFIVE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS AZUBAH THE DAUGHTER OF SHILHI

HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF ASA HIS FATHER AND DID NOT TURN ASIDE FROM IT DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

THE HIGH PLACES HOWEVER WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY; THE PEOPLE HAD NOT YET SET THEIR HEARTS UPON THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOSHAPHAT FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE WRITTEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF JEHU THE SON OF HANANI WHICH ARE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AFTER THIS JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH JOINED WITH AHAZIAH KING OF ISRAEL WHO ACTED WICKEDLY

HE JOINED HIM IN BUILDING SHIPS TO GO TO TARSHISH AND THEY BUILT THE SHIPS IN EZIONGEBER

THEN ELIEZER THE SON OF DODAVAHU OF MARESHAH PROPHESIED AGAINST JEHOSHAPHAT SAYING BECAUSE YOU HAVE JOINED WITH AHAZIAH THE LORD WILL DESTROY WHAT YOU HAVE MADE

 AND THE SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND WERE NOT ABLE TO GO TO TARSHISH

JEHOSHAPHAT SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND JEHORAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

HE HAD BROTHERS THE SONS OF JEHOSHAPHAT AZARIAH JEHIEL ZECHARIAH AZARIAH MICHAEL AND SHEPHATIAH; ALL THESE WERE THE SONS OF JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH

THEIR FATHER GAVE THEM GREAT GIFTS OF SILVER GOLD AND VALUABLE POSSESSIONS TOGETHER WITH FORTIFIED CITIES IN JUDAH BUT HE GAVE THE KINGDOM TO JEHORAM BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRSTBORN

WHEN JEHORAM HAD ASCENDED THE THRONE OF HIS FATHER AND WAS ESTABLISHED HE KILLED ALL HIS BROTHERS WITH THE SWORD AND ALSO SOME OF THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL

JEHORAM WAS THIRTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING AND HE REIGNED EIGHT YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE FOR THE DAUGHTER OF AHAB WAS HIS WIFE

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

YET THE LORD WAS NOT WILLING TO DESTROY THE HOUSE OF DAVID BECAUSE OF THE COVENANT THAT HE HAD MADE WITH DAVID AND SINCE HE HAD PROMISED TO GIVE A LAMP TO HIM AND TO HIS SONS FOREVER

IN HIS DAYS EDOM REVOLTED FROM THE RULE OF JUDAH AND SET UP A KING OF THEIR OWN

THEN JEHORAM PASSED OVER WITH HIS COMMANDERS AND ALL HIS CHARIOTS AND HE ROSE BY NIGHT AND STRUCK THE EDOMITES WHO HAD SURROUNDED HIM AND HIS CHARIOT COMMANDERS

SO EDOM REVOLTED FROM THE RULE OF JUDAH TO THIS DAY

AT THAT TIME LIBNAH ALSO REVOLTED FROM HIS RULE BECAUSE HE HAD FORSAKEN THE LORD THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS

MOREOVER HE MADE HIGH PLACES IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUDAH AND LED THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM INTO WHOREDOM AND MADE JUDAH GO ASTRAY

AND A LETTER CAME TO HIM FROM ELIJAH THE PROPHET SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF DAVID YOUR FATHER 'BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT WALKED IN THE WAYS OF JEHOSHAPHAT YOUR FATHER OR IN THE WAYS OF ASA KING OF JUDAH BUT HAVE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND HAVE ENTICED JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM INTO WHOREDOM AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB LED ISRAEL INTO WHOREDOM AND ALSO YOU HAVE KILLED YOUR BROTHERS OF YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE WHO WERE BETTER THAN YOURSELF BEHOLD THE LORD WILL BRING A GREAT PLAGUE ON YOUR PEOPLE YOUR CHILDREN YOUR WIVES AND ALL YOUR POSSESSIONS AND YOU YOURSELF WILL HAVE A SEVERE SICKNESS WITH A DISEASE OF YOUR BOWELS UNTIL YOUR BOWELS COME OUT BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE DAY BY DAY

' AND THE LORD STIRRED UP AGAINST JEHORAM THE ANGER OF THE PHILISTINES AND OF THE ARABIANS WHO ARE NEAR THE ETHIOPIANS

AND THEY CAME UP AGAINST JUDAH AND INVADED IT AND CARRIED AWAY ALL THE POSSESSIONS THEY FOUND THAT BELONGED TO THE KING'S HOUSE AND ALSO HIS SONS AND HIS WIVES SO THAT NO SON WAS LEFT TO HIM EXCEPT JEHOAHAZ HIS YOUNGEST SON

AND AFTER ALL THIS THE LORD STRUCK HIM IN HIS BOWELS WITH AN INCURABLE DISEASE

IN COURSE OF TIME AT THE END OF TWO YEARS HIS BOWELS CAME OUT BECAUSE OF THE DISEASE AND HE DIED IN GREAT AGONY

HIS PEOPLE MADE NO FIRE IN HIS HONOR LIKE THE FIRES MADE FOR HIS FATHERS

HE WAS THIRTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED EIGHT YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DEPARTED WITH NO ONE'S REGRET

THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID BUT NOT IN THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS

AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM MADE AHAZIAH HIS YOUNGEST SON KING IN HIS PLACE FOR THE BAND OF MEN THAT CAME WITH THE ARABIANS TO THE CAMP HAD KILLED ALL THE OLDER SONS

SO AHAZIAH THE SON OF JEHORAM KING OF JUDAH REIGNED

AHAZIAH WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED ONE YEAR IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ATHALIAH THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF OMRI

HE ALSO WALKED IN THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB FOR HIS MOTHER WAS HIS COUNSELOR IN DOING WICKEDLY

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE

FOR AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER THEY WERE HIS COUNSELORS TO HIS UNDOING

HE EVEN FOLLOWED THEIR COUNSEL AND WENT WITH JEHORAM THE SON OF AHAB KING OF ISRAEL TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA AT RAMOTHGILEAD

AND THE SYRIANS WOUNDED JORAM AND HE RETURNED TO BE HEALED IN JEZREEL OF THE WOUNDS THAT HE HAD RECEIVED AT RAMAH WHEN HE FOUGHT AGAINST HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA

AND AHAZIAH THE SON OF JEHORAM KING OF JUDAH WENT DOWN TO SEE JORAM THE SON OF AHAB IN JEZREEL BECAUSE HE WAS WOUNDED

BUT IT WAS ORDAINED BY GOD THAT THE DOWNFALL OF AHAZIAH SHOULD COME ABOUT THROUGH HIS GOING TO VISIT JORAM

FOR WHEN HE CAME THERE HE WENT OUT WITH JEHORAM TO MEET JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI WHOM THE LORD HAD ANOINTED TO DESTROY THE HOUSE OF AHAB

AND WHEN JEHU WAS EXECUTING JUDGMENT ON THE HOUSE OF AHAB HE MET THE PRINCES OF JUDAH AND THE SONS OF AHAZIAH'S BROTHERS WHO ATTENDED AHAZIAH AND HE KILLED THEM

HE SEARCHED FOR AHAZIAH AND HE WAS CAPTURED WHILE HIDING IN SAMARIA AND HE WAS BROUGHT TO JEHU AND PUT TO DEATH

THEY BURIED HIM FOR THEY SAID HE IS THE GRANDSON OF JEHOSHAPHAT WHO SOUGHT THE LORD WITH ALL HIS HEART

 AND THE HOUSE OF AHAZIAH HAD NO ONE ABLE TO RULE THE KINGDOM

NOW WHEN ATHALIAH THE MOTHER OF AHAZIAH SAW THAT HER SON WAS DEAD SHE AROSE AND DESTROYED ALL THE ROYAL FAMILY OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

BUT JEHOSHABEATH THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING TOOK JOASH THE SON OF AHAZIAH AND STOLE HIM AWAY FROM AMONG THE KING'S SONS WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE PUT TO DEATH AND SHE PUT HIM AND HIS NURSE IN A BEDROOM

THUS JEHOSHABEATH THE DAUGHTER OF KING JEHORAM AND WIFE OF JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BECAUSE SHE WAS A SISTER OF AHAZIAH HID HIM FROM ATHALIAH SO THAT SHE DID NOT PUT HIM TO DEATH

AND HE REMAINED WITH THEM SIX YEARS HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD WHILE ATHALIAH REIGNED OVER THE LAND

BUT IN THE SEVENTH YEAR JEHOIADA TOOK COURAGE AND ENTERED INTO A COVENANT WITH THE COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS AZARIAH THE SON OF JEROHAM ISHMAEL THE SON OF JEHOHANAN AZARIAH THE SON OF OBED MAASEIAH THE SON OF ADAIAH AND ELISHAPHAT THE SON OF ZICHRI

AND THEY WENT ABOUT THROUGH JUDAH AND GATHERED THE LEVITES FROM ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES OF ISRAEL AND THEY CAME TO JERUSALEM

AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY MADE A COVENANT WITH THE KING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

AND JEHOIADA SAID TO THEM BEHOLD THE KING'S SON

LET HIM REIGN AS THE LORD SPOKE CONCERNING THE SONS OF DAVID

THIS IS THE THING THAT YOU SHALL DO OF YOU PRIESTS AND LEVITES WHO COME OFF DUTY ON THE SABBATH ONE THIRD SHALL BE GATEKEEPERS AND ONE THIRD SHALL BE AT THE KING'S HOUSE AND ONE THIRD AT THE GATE OF THE FOUNDATION

AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL BE IN THE COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

LET NO ONE ENTER THE HOUSE OF THE LORD EXCEPT THE PRIESTS AND MINISTERING LEVITES

THEY MAY ENTER FOR THEY ARE HOLY BUT ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE LORD

THE LEVITES SHALL SURROUND THE KING EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS IN HIS HAND

AND WHOEVER ENTERS THE HOUSE SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

BE WITH THE KING WHEN HE COMES IN AND WHEN HE GOES OUT

 THE LEVITES AND ALL JUDAH DID ACCORDING TO ALL THAT JEHOIADA THE PRIEST COMMANDED AND THEY EACH BROUGHT HIS MEN WHO WERE TO GO OFF DUTY ON THE SABBATH WITH THOSE WHO WERE TO COME ON DUTY ON THE SABBATH FOR JEHOIADA THE PRIEST DID NOT DISMISS THE DIVISIONS

AND JEHOIADA THE PRIEST GAVE TO THE CAPTAINS THE SPEARS AND THE LARGE AND SMALL SHIELDS THAT HAD BEEN KING DAVID'S WHICH WERE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

AND HE SET ALL THE PEOPLE AS A GUARD FOR THE KING EVERY MAN WITH HIS WEAPON IN HIS HAND FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE AROUND THE ALTAR AND THE HOUSE

THEN THEY BROUGHT OUT THE KING'S SON AND PUT THE CROWN ON HIM AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY

AND THEY PROCLAIMED HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND THEY SAID LONG LIVE THE KING

 WHEN ATHALIAH HEARD THE NOISE OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING AND PRAISING THE KING SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO THE PEOPLE

AND WHEN SHE LOOKED THERE WAS THE KING STANDING BY HIS PILLAR AT THE ENTRANCE AND THE CAPTAINS AND THE TRUMPETERS BESIDE THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICING AND BLOWING TRUMPETS AND THE SINGERS WITH THEIR MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS LEADING IN THE CELEBRATION

AND ATHALIAH TORE HER CLOTHES AND CRIED TREASON

TREASON

 THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS WHO WERE SET OVER THE ARMY SAYING TO THEM BRING HER OUT BETWEEN THE RANKS AND ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS HER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD

 FOR THE PRIEST SAID DO NOT PUT HER TO DEATH IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER AND SHE WENT INTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE HORSE GATE OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND THEY PUT HER TO DEATH THERE

AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ALL THE PEOPLE AND THE KING THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE LORD'S PEOPLE

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND TORE IT DOWN; HIS ALTARS AND HIS IMAGES THEY BROKE IN PIECES AND THEY KILLED MATTAN THE PRIEST OF BAAL BEFORE THE ALTARS

AND JEHOIADA POSTED WATCHMEN FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WHOM DAVID HAD ORGANIZED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES WITH REJOICING AND WITH SINGING ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF DAVID

HE STATIONED THE GATEKEEPERS AT THE GATES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD ENTER WHO WAS IN ANY WAY UNCLEAN

AND HE TOOK THE CAPTAINS THE NOBLES THE GOVERNORS OF THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND THEY BROUGHT THE KING DOWN FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD MARCHING THROUGH THE UPPER GATE TO THE KING'S HOUSE

AND THEY SET THE KING ON THE ROYAL THRONE

SO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND THE CITY WAS QUIET AFTER ATHALIAH HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD

JOASH WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FORTY YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ZIBIAH OF BEERSHEBA

AND JOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF JEHOIADA THE PRIEST

JEHOIADA GOT FOR HIM TWO WIVES AND HE HAD SONS AND DAUGHTERS

AFTER THIS JOASH DECIDED TO RESTORE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE GATHERED THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND SAID TO THEM GO OUT TO THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND GATHER FROM ALL ISRAEL MONEY TO REPAIR THE HOUSE OF YOUR GOD FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SEE THAT YOU ACT QUICKLY

 BUT THE LEVITES DID NOT ACT QUICKLY

SO THE KING SUMMONED JEHOIADA THE CHIEF AND SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOU NOT REQUIRED THE LEVITES TO BRING IN FROM JUDAH AND JERUSALEM THE TAX LEVIED BY MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD AND THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL FOR THE TENT OF TESTIMONY

 FOR THE SONS OF ATHALIAH THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD BROKEN INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND HAD ALSO USED ALL THE DEDICATED THINGS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOR THE BAALS

SO THE KING COMMANDED AND THEY MADE A CHEST AND SET IT OUTSIDE THE GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND PROCLAMATION WAS MADE THROUGHOUT JUDAH AND JERUSALEM TO BRING IN FOR THE LORD THE TAX THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF GOD LAID ON ISRAEL IN THE WILDERNESS

AND ALL THE PRINCES AND ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED AND BROUGHT THEIR TAX AND DROPPED IT INTO THE CHEST UNTIL THEY HAD FINISHED

AND WHENEVER THE CHEST WAS BROUGHT TO THE KING'S OFFICERS BY THE LEVITES WHEN THEY SAW THAT THERE WAS MUCH MONEY IN IT THE KING'S SECRETARY AND THE OFFICER OF THE CHIEF PRIEST WOULD COME AND EMPTY THE CHEST AND TAKE IT AND RETURN IT TO ITS PLACE

THUS THEY DID DAY AFTER DAY AND COLLECTED MONEY IN ABUNDANCE

AND THE KING AND JEHOIADA GAVE IT TO THOSE WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE WORK OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THEY HIRED MASONS AND CARPENTERS TO RESTORE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND ALSO WORKERS IN IRON AND BRONZE TO REPAIR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

SO THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN THE WORK LABORED AND THE REPAIRING WENT FORWARD IN THEIR HANDS AND THEY RESTORED THE HOUSE OF GOD TO ITS PROPER CONDITION AND STRENGTHENED IT

AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEY BROUGHT THE REST OF THE MONEY BEFORE THE KING AND JEHOIADA AND WITH IT WERE MADE UTENSILS FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BOTH FOR THE SERVICE AND FOR THE BURNT OFFERINGS AND DISHES FOR INCENSE AND VESSELS OF GOLD AND SILVER

AND THEY OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD REGULARLY ALL THE DAYS OF JEHOIADA

BUT JEHOIADA GREW OLD AND FULL OF DAYS AND DIED

HE WAS  YEARS OLD AT HIS DEATH

AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID AMONG THE KINGS BECAUSE HE HAD DONE GOOD IN ISRAEL AND TOWARD GOD AND HIS HOUSE

NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND PAID HOMAGE TO THE KING

THEN THE KING LISTENED TO THEM

AND THEY ABANDONED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND SERVED THE ASHERIM AND THE IDOLS

AND WRATH CAME UPON JUDAH AND JERUSALEM FOR THIS GUILT OF THEIRS

YET HE SENT PROPHETS AMONG THEM TO BRING THEM BACK TO THE LORD

THESE TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT PAY ATTENTION

THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD CLOTHED ZECHARIAH THE SON OF JEHOIADA THE PRIEST AND HE STOOD ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS GOD 'WHY DO YOU BREAK THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD SO THAT YOU CANNOT PROSPER

BECAUSE YOU HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD HE HAS FORSAKEN YOU

' BUT THEY CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM AND BY COMMAND OF THE KING THEY STONED HIM WITH STONES IN THE COURT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THUS JOASH THE KING DID NOT REMEMBER THE KINDNESS THAT JEHOIADA ZECHARIAH'S FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM BUT KILLED HIS SON

AND WHEN HE WAS DYING HE SAID MAY THE LORD SEE AND AVENGE

 AT THE END OF THE YEAR THE ARMY OF THE SYRIANS CAME UP AGAINST JOASH

THEY CAME TO JUDAH AND JERUSALEM AND DESTROYED ALL THE PRINCES OF THE PEOPLE FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SENT ALL THEIR SPOIL TO THE KING OF DAMASCUS

THOUGH THE ARMY OF THE SYRIANS HAD COME WITH FEW MEN THE LORD DELIVERED INTO THEIR HAND A VERY GREAT ARMY BECAUSE JUDAH HAD FORSAKEN THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

THUS THEY EXECUTED JUDGMENT ON JOASH

WHEN THEY HAD DEPARTED FROM HIM LEAVING HIM SEVERELY WOUNDED HIS SERVANTS CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD OF THE SON OF JEHOIADA THE PRIEST AND KILLED HIM ON HIS BED

SO HE DIED AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID BUT THEY DID NOT BURY HIM IN THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS

THOSE WHO CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM WERE ZABAD THE SON OF SHIMEATH THE AMMONITE AND JEHOZABAD THE SON OF SHIMRITH THE MOABITE

ACCOUNTS OF HIS SONS AND OF THE MANY ORACLES AGAINST HIM AND OF THE REBUILDING OF THE HOUSE OF GOD ARE WRITTEN IN THE STORY OF THE BOOK OF THE KINGS

AND AMAZIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AMAZIAH WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWENTYNINE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS JEHOADDAN OF JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD YET NOT WITH A WHOLE HEART

AND AS SOON AS THE ROYAL POWER WAS FIRMLY HIS HE KILLED HIS SERVANTS WHO HAD STRUCK DOWN THE KING HIS FATHER

BUT HE DID NOT PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO DEATH ACCORDING TO WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW IN THE BOOK OF MOSES WHERE THE LORD COMMANDED FATHERS SHALL NOT DIE BECAUSE OF THEIR CHILDREN NOR CHILDREN DIE BECAUSE OF THEIR FATHERS BUT EACH ONE SHALL DIE FOR HIS OWN SIN

 THEN AMAZIAH ASSEMBLED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SET THEM BY FATHERS' HOUSES UNDER COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND OF HUNDREDS FOR ALL JUDAH AND BENJAMIN

HE MUSTERED THOSE TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE  CHOICE MEN FIT FOR WAR ABLE TO HANDLE SPEAR AND SHIELD

HE HIRED ALSO  MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR FROM ISRAEL FOR  TALENTS OF SILVER

BUT A MAN OF GOD CAME TO HIM AND SAID O KING DO NOT LET THE ARMY OF ISRAEL GO WITH YOU FOR THE LORD IS NOT WITH ISRAEL WITH ALL THESE EPHRAIMITES

BUT GO ACT BE STRONG FOR THE BATTLE

WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD WILL CAST YOU DOWN BEFORE THE ENEMY

FOR GOD HAS POWER TO HELP OR TO CAST DOWN

 AND AMAZIAH SAID TO THE MAN OF GOD BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO ABOUT THE HUNDRED TALENTS THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO THE ARMY OF ISRAEL

 THE MAN OF GOD ANSWERED THE LORD IS ABLE TO GIVE YOU MUCH MORE THAN THIS

 THEN AMAZIAH DISCHARGED THE ARMY THAT HAD COME TO HIM FROM EPHRAIM TO GO HOME AGAIN

AND THEY BECAME VERY ANGRY WITH JUDAH AND RETURNED HOME IN FIERCE ANGER

BUT AMAZIAH TOOK COURAGE AND LED OUT HIS PEOPLE AND WENT TO THE VALLEY OF SALT AND STRUCK DOWN  MEN OF SEIR

THE MEN OF JUDAH CAPTURED ANOTHER  ALIVE AND TOOK THEM TO THE TOP OF A ROCK AND THREW THEM DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AND THEY WERE ALL DASHED TO PIECES

BUT THE MEN OF THE ARMY WHOM AMAZIAH SENT BACK NOT LETTING THEM GO WITH HIM TO BATTLE RAIDED THE CITIES OF JUDAH FROM SAMARIA TO BETHHORON AND STRUCK DOWN  PEOPLE IN THEM AND TOOK MUCH SPOIL

AFTER AMAZIAH CAME FROM STRIKING DOWN THE EDOMITES HE BROUGHT THE GODS OF THE MEN OF SEIR AND SET THEM UP AS HIS GODS AND WORSHIPED THEM MAKING OFFERINGS TO THEM

THEREFORE THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH AMAZIAH AND SENT TO HIM A PROPHET WHO SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOU SOUGHT THE GODS OF A PEOPLE WHO DID NOT DELIVER THEIR OWN PEOPLE FROM YOUR HAND

 BUT AS HE WAS SPEAKING THE KING SAID TO HIM HAVE WE MADE YOU A ROYAL COUNSELOR

STOP

WHY SHOULD YOU BE STRUCK DOWN

 SO THE PROPHET STOPPED BUT SAID I KNOW THAT GOD HAS DETERMINED TO DESTROY YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS AND HAVE NOT LISTENED TO MY COUNSEL

 THEN AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH TOOK COUNSEL AND SENT TO JOASH THE SON OF JEHOAHAZ SON OF JEHU KING OF ISRAEL SAYING COME LET US LOOK ONE ANOTHER IN THE FACE

 AND JOASH THE KING OF ISRAEL SENT WORD TO AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH A THISTLE ON LEBANON SENT TO A CEDAR ON LEBANON SAYING 'GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY SON FOR A WIFE' AND A WILD BEAST OF LEBANON PASSED BY AND TRAMPLED DOWN THE THISTLE

YOU SAY 'SEE I HAVE STRUCK DOWN EDOM' AND YOUR HEART HAS LIFTED YOU UP IN BOASTFULNESS

BUT NOW STAY AT HOME

WHY SHOULD YOU PROVOKE TROUBLE SO THAT YOU FALL YOU AND JUDAH WITH YOU

 BUT AMAZIAH WOULD NOT LISTEN FOR IT WAS OF GOD IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES BECAUSE THEY HAD SOUGHT THE GODS OF EDOM

SO JOASH KING OF ISRAEL WENT UP AND HE AND AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH FACED ONE ANOTHER IN BATTLE AT BETHSHEMESH WHICH BELONGS TO JUDAH

AND JUDAH WAS DEFEATED BY ISRAEL AND EVERY MAN FLED TO HIS HOME

AND JOASH KING OF ISRAEL CAPTURED AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH THE SON OF JOASH SON OF AHAZIAH AT BETHSHEMESH AND BROUGHT HIM TO JERUSALEM AND BROKE DOWN THE WALL OF JERUSALEM FOR  CUBITS FROM THE EPHRAIM GATE TO THE CORNER GATE

AND HE SEIZED ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER AND ALL THE VESSELS THAT WERE FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF GOD IN THE CARE OF OBEDEDOM

HE SEIZED ALSO THE TREASURIES OF THE KING'S HOUSE ALSO HOSTAGES AND HE RETURNED TO SAMARIA

AMAZIAH THE SON OF JOASH KING OF JUDAH LIVED FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF JOASH THE SON OF JEHOAHAZ KING OF ISRAEL

NOW THE REST OF THE DEEDS OF AMAZIAH FROM FIRST TO LAST ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL

FROM THE TIME WHEN HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE LORD THEY MADE A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM IN JERUSALEM AND HE FLED TO LACHISH

BUT THEY SENT AFTER HIM TO LACHISH AND PUT HIM TO DEATH THERE

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM UPON HORSES AND HE WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID

AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH TOOK UZZIAH WHO WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND MADE HIM KING INSTEAD OF HIS FATHER AMAZIAH

HE BUILT ELOTH AND RESTORED IT TO JUDAH AFTER THE KING SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS

UZZIAH WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FIFTYTWO YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS JECOLIAH OF JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HIS FATHER AMAZIAH HAD DONE

HE SET HIMSELF TO SEEK GOD IN THE DAYS OF ZECHARIAH WHO INSTRUCTED HIM IN THE FEAR OF GOD AND AS LONG AS HE SOUGHT THE LORD GOD MADE HIM PROSPER

HE WENT OUT AND MADE WAR AGAINST THE PHILISTINES AND BROKE THROUGH THE WALL OF GATH AND THE WALL OF JABNEH AND THE WALL OF ASHDOD AND HE BUILT CITIES IN THE TERRITORY OF ASHDOD AND ELSEWHERE AMONG THE PHILISTINES

GOD HELPED HIM AGAINST THE PHILISTINES AND AGAINST THE ARABIANS WHO LIVED IN GURBAAL AND AGAINST THE MEUNITES

THE AMMONITES PAID TRIBUTE TO UZZIAH AND HIS FAME SPREAD EVEN TO THE BORDER OF EGYPT FOR HE BECAME VERY STRONG

MOREOVER UZZIAH BUILT TOWERS IN JERUSALEM AT THE CORNER GATE AND AT THE VALLEY GATE AND AT THE ANGLE AND FORTIFIED THEM

AND HE BUILT TOWERS IN THE WILDERNESS AND CUT OUT MANY CISTERNS FOR HE HAD LARGE HERDS BOTH IN THE SHEPHELAH AND IN THE PLAIN AND HE HAD FARMERS AND VINEDRESSERS IN THE HILLS AND IN THE FERTILE LANDS FOR HE LOVED THE SOIL

MOREOVER UZZIAH HAD AN ARMY OF SOLDIERS FIT FOR WAR IN DIVISIONS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBERS IN THE MUSTER MADE BY JEIEL THE SECRETARY AND MAASEIAH THE OFFICER UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HANANIAH ONE OF THE KING'S COMMANDERS

THE WHOLE NUMBER OF THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES OF MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR WAS 

UNDER THEIR COMMAND WAS AN ARMY OF  WHO COULD MAKE WAR WITH MIGHTY POWER TO HELP THE KING AGAINST THE ENEMY

AND UZZIAH PREPARED FOR ALL THE ARMY SHIELDS SPEARS HELMETS COATS OF MAIL BOWS AND STONES FOR SLINGING

IN JERUSALEM HE MADE ENGINES INVENTED BY SKILLFUL MEN TO BE ON THE TOWERS AND THE CORNERS TO SHOOT ARROWS AND GREAT STONES

AND HIS FAME SPREAD FAR FOR HE WAS MARVELOUSLY HELPED TILL HE WAS STRONG

BUT WHEN HE WAS STRONG HE GREW PROUD TO HIS DESTRUCTION

FOR HE WAS UNFAITHFUL TO THE LORD HIS GOD AND ENTERED THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD TO BURN INCENSE ON THE ALTAR OF INCENSE

BUT AZARIAH THE PRIEST WENT IN AFTER HIM WITH EIGHTY PRIESTS OF THE LORD WHO WERE MEN OF VALOR AND THEY WITHSTOOD KING UZZIAH AND SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT FOR YOU UZZIAH TO BURN INCENSE TO THE LORD BUT FOR THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF AARON WHO ARE CONSECRATED TO BURN INCENSE

GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY FOR YOU HAVE DONE WRONG AND IT WILL BRING YOU NO HONOR FROM THE LORD GOD

 THEN UZZIAH WAS ANGRY

NOW HE HAD A CENSER IN HIS HAND TO BURN INCENSE AND WHEN HE BECAME ANGRY WITH THE PRIESTS LEPROSY BROKE OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRIESTS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BY THE ALTAR OF INCENSE

AND AZARIAH THE CHIEF PRIEST AND ALL THE PRIESTS LOOKED AT HIM AND BEHOLD HE WAS LEPROUS IN HIS FOREHEAD

AND THEY RUSHED HIM OUT QUICKLY AND HE HIMSELF HURRIED TO GO OUT BECAUSE THE LORD HAD STRUCK HIM

AND KING UZZIAH WAS A LEPER TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND BEING A LEPER LIVED IN A SEPARATE HOUSE FOR HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND JOTHAM HIS SON WAS OVER THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD GOVERNING THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF UZZIAH FROM FIRST TO LAST ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE SON OF AMOZ WROTE

AND UZZIAH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE BURIAL FIELD THAT BELONGED TO THE KINGS FOR THEY SAID HE IS A LEPER

 AND JOTHAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

JOTHAM WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SIXTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS JERUSHAH THE DAUGHTER OF ZADOK

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HIS FATHER UZZIAH HAD DONE EXCEPT HE DID NOT ENTER THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

BUT THE PEOPLE STILL FOLLOWED CORRUPT PRACTICES

HE BUILT THE UPPER GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND DID MUCH BUILDING ON THE WALL OF OPHEL

MOREOVER HE BUILT CITIES IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUDAH AND FORTS AND TOWERS ON THE WOODED HILLS

HE FOUGHT WITH THE KING OF THE AMMONITES AND PREVAILED AGAINST THEM

AND THE AMMONITES GAVE HIM THAT YEAR  TALENTS OF SILVER AND  CORS OF WHEAT AND  OF BARLEY

THE AMMONITES PAID HIM THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE SECOND AND THE THIRD YEARS

SO JOTHAM BECAME MIGHTY BECAUSE HE ORDERED HIS WAYS BEFORE THE LORD HIS GOD

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOTHAM AND ALL HIS WARS AND HIS WAYS BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH

HE WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SIXTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND JOTHAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND AHAZ HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AHAZ WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SIXTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DID NOT DO WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AS HIS FATHER DAVID HAD DONE BUT HE WALKED IN THE WAYS OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

HE EVEN MADE METAL IMAGES FOR THE BAALS AND HE MADE OFFERINGS IN THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM AND BURNED HIS SONS AS AN OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND HE SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES AND ON THE HILLS AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE

THEREFORE THE LORD HIS GOD GAVE HIM INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF SYRIA WHO DEFEATED HIM AND TOOK CAPTIVE A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS PEOPLE AND BROUGHT THEM TO DAMASCUS

HE WAS ALSO GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ISRAEL WHO STRUCK HIM WITH GREAT FORCE

FOR PEKAH THE SON OF REMALIAH KILLED  FROM JUDAH IN ONE DAY ALL OF THEM MEN OF VALOR BECAUSE THEY HAD FORSAKEN THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

AND ZICHRI A MIGHTY MAN OF EPHRAIM KILLED MAASEIAH THE KING'S SON AND AZRIKAM THE COMMANDER OF THE PALACE AND ELKANAH THE NEXT IN AUTHORITY TO THE KING

THE MEN OF ISRAEL TOOK CAPTIVE  OF THEIR RELATIVES WOMEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS

THEY ALSO TOOK MUCH SPOIL FROM THEM AND BROUGHT THE SPOIL TO SAMARIA

BUT A PROPHET OF THE LORD WAS THERE WHOSE NAME WAS ODED AND HE WENT OUT TO MEET THE ARMY THAT CAME TO SAMARIA AND SAID TO THEM BEHOLD BECAUSE THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS WAS ANGRY WITH JUDAH HE GAVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND BUT YOU HAVE KILLED THEM IN A RAGE THAT HAS REACHED UP TO HEAVEN

AND NOW YOU INTEND TO SUBJUGATE THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM MALE AND FEMALE AS YOUR SLAVES

HAVE YOU NOT SINS OF YOUR OWN AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD

NOW HEAR ME AND SEND BACK THE CAPTIVES FROM YOUR RELATIVES WHOM YOU HAVE TAKEN FOR THE FIERCE WRATH OF THE LORD IS UPON YOU

 CERTAIN CHIEFS ALSO OF THE MEN OF EPHRAIM AZARIAH THE SON OF JOHANAN BERECHIAH THE SON OF MESHILLEMOTH JEHIZKIAH THE SON OF SHALLUM AND AMASA THE SON OF HADLAI STOOD UP AGAINST THOSE WHO WERE COMING FROM THE WAR AND SAID TO THEM YOU SHALL NOT BRING THE CAPTIVES IN HERE FOR YOU PROPOSE TO BRING UPON US GUILT AGAINST THE LORD IN ADDITION TO OUR PRESENT SINS AND GUILT

FOR OUR GUILT IS ALREADY GREAT AND THERE IS FIERCE WRATH AGAINST ISRAEL

 SO THE ARMED MEN LEFT THE CAPTIVES AND THE SPOIL BEFORE THE PRINCES AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY

AND THE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY NAME ROSE AND TOOK THE CAPTIVES AND WITH THE SPOIL THEY CLOTHED ALL WHO WERE NAKED AMONG THEM

THEY CLOTHED THEM GAVE THEM SANDALS PROVIDED THEM WITH FOOD AND DRINK AND ANOINTED THEM AND CARRYING ALL THE FEEBLE AMONG THEM ON DONKEYS THEY BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR KINSFOLK AT JERICHO THE CITY OF PALM TREES

THEN THEY RETURNED TO SAMARIA

AT THAT TIME KING AHAZ SENT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA FOR HELP

FOR THE EDOMITES HAD AGAIN INVADED AND DEFEATED JUDAH AND CARRIED AWAY CAPTIVES

AND THE PHILISTINES HAD MADE RAIDS ON THE CITIES IN THE SHEPHELAH AND THE NEGEB OF JUDAH AND HAD TAKEN BETHSHEMESH AIJALON GEDEROTH SOCO WITH ITS VILLAGES TIMNAH WITH ITS VILLAGES AND GIMZO WITH ITS VILLAGES

AND THEY SETTLED THERE

FOR THE LORD HUMBLED JUDAH BECAUSE OF AHAZ KING OF ISRAEL FOR HE HAD MADE JUDAH ACT SINFULLY AND HAD BEEN VERY UNFAITHFUL TO THE LORD

SO TIGLATHPILESER KING OF ASSYRIA CAME AGAINST HIM AND AFFLICTED HIM INSTEAD OF STRENGTHENING HIM

FOR AHAZ TOOK A PORTION FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE HOUSE OF THE KING AND OF THE PRINCES AND GAVE TRIBUTE TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA BUT IT DID NOT HELP HIM

IN THE TIME OF HIS DISTRESS HE BECAME YET MORE FAITHLESS TO THE LORDTHIS SAME KING AHAZ

FOR HE SACRIFICED TO THE GODS OF DAMASCUS THAT HAD DEFEATED HIM AND SAID BECAUSE THE GODS OF THE KINGS OF SYRIA HELPED THEM I WILL SACRIFICE TO THEM THAT THEY MAY HELP ME

 BUT THEY WERE THE RUIN OF HIM AND OF ALL ISRAEL

AND AHAZ GATHERED TOGETHER THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD AND CUT IN PIECES THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD AND HE SHUT UP THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND HE MADE HIMSELF ALTARS IN EVERY CORNER OF JERUSALEM

IN EVERY CITY OF JUDAH HE MADE HIGH PLACES TO MAKE OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS PROVOKING TO ANGER THE LORD THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS

NOW THE REST OF HIS ACTS AND ALL HIS WAYS FROM FIRST TO LAST BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL

AND AHAZ SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY IN JERUSALEM FOR THEY DID NOT BRING HIM INTO THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND HEZEKIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

HEZEKIAH BEGAN TO REIGN WHEN HE WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD AND HE REIGNED TWENTYNINE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ABIJAH THE DAUGHTER OF ZECHARIAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT DAVID HIS FATHER HAD DONE

IN THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN IN THE FIRST MONTH HE OPENED THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND REPAIRED THEM

HE BROUGHT IN THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND ASSEMBLED THEM IN THE SQUARE ON THE EAST AND SAID TO THEM HEAR ME LEVITES

NOW CONSECRATE YOURSELVES AND CONSECRATE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS AND CARRY OUT THE FILTH FROM THE HOLY PLACE

FOR OUR FATHERS HAVE BEEN UNFAITHFUL AND HAVE DONE WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD OUR GOD

THEY HAVE FORSAKEN HIM AND HAVE TURNED AWAY THEIR FACES FROM THE HABITATION OF THE LORD AND TURNED THEIR BACKS

THEY ALSO SHUT THE DOORS OF THE VESTIBULE AND PUT OUT THE LAMPS AND HAVE NOT BURNED INCENSE OR OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS IN THE HOLY PLACE TO THE GOD OF ISRAEL

THEREFORE THE WRATH OF THE LORD CAME ON JUDAH AND JERUSALEM AND HE HAS MADE THEM AN OBJECT OF HORROR OF ASTONISHMENT AND OF HISSING AS YOU SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES

FOR BEHOLD OUR FATHERS HAVE FALLEN BY THE SWORD AND OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR WIVES ARE IN CAPTIVITY FOR THIS

NOW IT IS IN MY HEART TO MAKE A COVENANT WITH THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL IN ORDER THAT HIS FIERCE ANGER MAY TURN AWAY FROM US

MY SONS DO NOT NOW BE NEGLIGENT FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN YOU TO STAND IN HIS PRESENCE TO MINISTER TO HIM AND TO BE HIS MINISTERS AND MAKE OFFERINGS TO HIM

 THEN THE LEVITES AROSE MAHATH THE SON OF AMASAI AND JOEL THE SON OF AZARIAH OF THE SONS OF THE KOHATHITES; AND OF THE SONS OF MERARI KISH THE SON OF ABDI AND AZARIAH THE SON OF JEHALLELEL; AND OF THE GERSHONITES JOAH THE SON OF ZIMMAH AND EDEN THE SON OF JOAH; AND OF THE SONS OF ELIZAPHAN SHIMRI AND JEUEL; AND OF THE SONS OF ASAPH ZECHARIAH AND MATTANIAH; AND OF THE SONS OF HEMAN JEHUEL AND SHIMEI; AND OF THE SONS OF JEDUTHUN SHEMAIAH AND UZZIEL

THEY GATHERED THEIR BROTHERS AND CONSECRATED THEMSELVES AND WENT IN AS THE KING HAD COMMANDED BY THE WORDS OF THE LORD TO CLEANSE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THE PRIESTS WENT INTO THE INNER PART OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO CLEANSE IT AND THEY BROUGHT OUT ALL THE UNCLEANNESS THAT THEY FOUND IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD INTO THE COURT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE LEVITES TOOK IT AND CARRIED IT OUT TO THE BROOK KIDRON

THEY BEGAN TO CONSECRATE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE MONTH THEY CAME TO THE VESTIBULE OF THE LORD

THEN FOR EIGHT DAYS THEY CONSECRATED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH THEY FINISHED

THEN THEY WENT IN TO HEZEKIAH THE KING AND SAID WE HAVE CLEANSED ALL THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING AND ALL ITS UTENSILS AND THE TABLE FOR THE SHOWBREAD AND ALL ITS UTENSILS

ALL THE UTENSILS THAT KING AHAZ DISCARDED IN HIS REIGN WHEN HE WAS FAITHLESS WE HAVE MADE READY AND CONSECRATED AND BEHOLD THEY ARE BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE LORD

 THEN HEZEKIAH THE KING ROSE EARLY AND GATHERED THE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY AND WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THEY BROUGHT SEVEN BULLS SEVEN RAMS SEVEN LAMBS AND SEVEN MALE GOATS FOR A SIN OFFERING FOR THE KINGDOM AND FOR THE SANCTUARY AND FOR JUDAH

AND HE COMMANDED THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF AARON TO OFFER THEM ON THE ALTAR OF THE LORD

SO THEY SLAUGHTERED THE BULLS AND THE PRIESTS RECEIVED THE BLOOD AND THREW IT AGAINST THE ALTAR

AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THE RAMS AND THEIR BLOOD WAS THROWN AGAINST THE ALTAR

AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THE LAMBS AND THEIR BLOOD WAS THROWN AGAINST THE ALTAR

THEN THE GOATS FOR THE SIN OFFERING WERE BROUGHT TO THE KING AND THE ASSEMBLY AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THEM AND THE PRIESTS SLAUGHTERED THEM AND MADE A SIN OFFERING WITH THEIR BLOOD ON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR ALL ISRAEL

FOR THE KING COMMANDED THAT THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE SIN OFFERING SHOULD BE MADE FOR ALL ISRAEL

AND HE STATIONED THE LEVITES IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WITH CYMBALS HARPS AND LYRES ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF DAVID AND OF GAD THE KING'S SEER AND OF NATHAN THE PROPHET FOR THE COMMANDMENT WAS FROM THE LORD THROUGH HIS PROPHETS

THE LEVITES STOOD WITH THE INSTRUMENTS OF DAVID AND THE PRIESTS WITH THE TRUMPETS

THEN HEZEKIAH COMMANDED THAT THE BURNT OFFERING BE OFFERED ON THE ALTAR

AND WHEN THE BURNT OFFERING BEGAN THE SONG TO THE LORD BEGAN ALSO AND THE TRUMPETS ACCOMPANIED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL

THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WORSHIPED AND THE SINGERS SANG AND THE TRUMPETERS SOUNDED

ALL THIS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BURNT OFFERING WAS FINISHED

WHEN THE OFFERING WAS FINISHED THE KING AND ALL WHO WERE PRESENT WITH HIM BOWED THEMSELVES AND WORSHIPED

AND HEZEKIAH THE KING AND THE OFFICIALS COMMANDED THE LEVITES TO SING PRAISES TO THE LORD WITH THE WORDS OF DAVID AND OF ASAPH THE SEER

AND THEY SANG PRAISES WITH GLADNESS AND THEY BOWED DOWN AND WORSHIPED

THEN HEZEKIAH SAID YOU HAVE NOW CONSECRATED YOURSELVES TO THE LORD

COME NEAR; BRING SACRIFICES AND THANK OFFERINGS TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 AND THE ASSEMBLY BROUGHT SACRIFICES AND THANK OFFERINGS AND ALL WHO WERE OF A WILLING HEART BROUGHT BURNT OFFERINGS

THE NUMBER OF THE BURNT OFFERINGS THAT THE ASSEMBLY BROUGHT WAS  BULLS  RAMS AND  LAMBS; ALL THESE WERE FOR A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD

AND THE CONSECRATED OFFERINGS WERE  BULLS AND  SHEEP

BUT THE PRIESTS WERE TOO FEW AND COULD NOT FLAY ALL THE BURNT OFFERINGS SO UNTIL OTHER PRIESTS HAD CONSECRATED THEMSELVES THEIR BROTHERS THE LEVITES HELPED THEM UNTIL THE WORK WAS FINISHEDFOR THE LEVITES WERE MORE UPRIGHT IN HEART THAN THE PRIESTS IN CONSECRATING THEMSELVES

BESIDES THE GREAT NUMBER OF BURNT OFFERINGS THERE WAS THE FAT OF THE PEACE OFFERINGS AND THERE WERE THE DRINK OFFERINGS FOR THE BURNT OFFERINGS

THUS THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS RESTORED

AND HEZEKIAH AND ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED BECAUSE GOD HAD PREPARED FOR THE PEOPLE FOR THE THING CAME ABOUT SUDDENLY

HEZEKIAH SENT TO ALL ISRAEL AND JUDAH AND WROTE LETTERS ALSO TO EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH THAT THEY SHOULD COME TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AT JERUSALEM TO KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

FOR THE KING AND HIS PRINCES AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY IN JERUSALEM HAD TAKEN COUNSEL TO KEEP THE PASSOVER IN THE SECOND MONTH FOR THEY COULD NOT KEEP IT AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THE PRIESTS HAD NOT CONSECRATED THEMSELVES IN SUFFICIENT NUMBER NOR HAD THE PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN JERUSALEM AND THE PLAN SEEMED RIGHT TO THE KING AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY

SO THEY DECREED TO MAKE A PROCLAMATION THROUGHOUT ALL ISRAEL FROM BEERSHEBA TO DAN THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD COME AND KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL AT JERUSALEM FOR THEY HAD NOT KEPT IT AS OFTEN AS PRESCRIBED

SO COURIERS WENT THROUGHOUT ALL ISRAEL AND JUDAH WITH LETTERS FROM THE KING AND HIS PRINCES AS THE KING HAD COMMANDED SAYING O PEOPLE OF ISRAEL RETURN TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ABRAHAM ISAAC AND ISRAEL THAT HE MAY TURN AGAIN TO THE REMNANT OF YOU WHO HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE HAND OF THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA

DO NOT BE LIKE YOUR FATHERS AND YOUR BROTHERS WHO WERE FAITHLESS TO THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS SO THAT HE MADE THEM A DESOLATION AS YOU SEE

DO NOT NOW BE STIFFNECKED AS YOUR FATHERS WERE BUT YIELD YOURSELVES TO THE LORD AND COME TO HIS SANCTUARY WHICH HE HAS CONSECRATED FOREVER AND SERVE THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT HIS FIERCE ANGER MAY TURN AWAY FROM YOU

FOR IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD YOUR BROTHERS AND YOUR CHILDREN WILL FIND COMPASSION WITH THEIR CAPTORS AND RETURN TO THIS LAND

FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL AND WILL NOT TURN AWAY HIS FACE FROM YOU IF YOU RETURN TO HIM

 SO THE COURIERS WENT FROM CITY TO CITY THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH AND AS FAR AS ZEBULUN BUT THEY LAUGHED THEM TO SCORN AND MOCKED THEM

HOWEVER SOME MEN OF ASHER OF MANASSEH AND OF ZEBULUN HUMBLED THEMSELVES AND CAME TO JERUSALEM

THE HAND OF GOD WAS ALSO ON JUDAH TO GIVE THEM ONE HEART TO DO WHAT THE KING AND THE PRINCES COMMANDED BY THE WORD OF THE LORD

AND MANY PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER IN JERUSALEM TO KEEP THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD IN THE SECOND MONTH A VERY GREAT ASSEMBLY

THEY SET TO WORK AND REMOVED THE ALTARS THAT WERE IN JERUSALEM AND ALL THE ALTARS FOR BURNING INCENSE THEY TOOK AWAY AND THREW INTO THE KIDRON VALLEY

AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THE PASSOVER LAMB ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH

AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WERE ASHAMED SO THAT THEY CONSECRATED THEMSELVES AND BROUGHT BURNT OFFERINGS INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THEY TOOK THEIR ACCUSTOMED POSTS ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE MAN OF GOD

THE PRIESTS THREW THE BLOOD THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM THE HAND OF THE LEVITES

FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THE ASSEMBLY WHO HAD NOT CONSECRATED THEMSELVES

THEREFORE THE LEVITES HAD TO SLAUGHTER THE PASSOVER LAMB FOR EVERYONE WHO WAS NOT CLEAN TO CONSECRATE IT TO THE LORD

FOR A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE MANY OF THEM FROM EPHRAIM MANASSEH ISSACHAR AND ZEBULUN HAD NOT CLEANSED THEMSELVES YET THEY ATE THE PASSOVER OTHERWISE THAN AS PRESCRIBED

FOR HEZEKIAH HAD PRAYED FOR THEM SAYING MAY THE GOOD LORD PARDON EVERYONE WHO SETS HIS HEART TO SEEK GOD THE LORD THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS EVEN THOUGH NOT ACCORDING TO THE SANCTUARY'S RULES OF CLEANNESS

 AND THE LORD HEARD HEZEKIAH AND HEALED THE PEOPLE

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO WERE PRESENT AT JERUSALEM KEPT THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD SEVEN DAYS WITH GREAT GLADNESS AND THE LEVITES AND THE PRIESTS PRAISED THE LORD DAY BY DAY SINGING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT TO THE LORD

AND HEZEKIAH SPOKE ENCOURAGINGLY TO ALL THE LEVITES WHO SHOWED GOOD SKILL IN THE SERVICE OF THE LORD

SO THEY ATE THE FOOD OF THE FESTIVAL FOR SEVEN DAYS SACRIFICING PEACE OFFERINGS AND GIVING THANKS TO THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

THEN THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY AGREED TOGETHER TO KEEP THE FEAST FOR ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS

SO THEY KEPT IT FOR ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS WITH GLADNESS

FOR HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH GAVE THE ASSEMBLY  BULLS AND  SHEEP FOR OFFERINGS AND THE PRINCES GAVE THE ASSEMBLY  BULLS AND  SHEEP

AND THE PRIESTS CONSECRATED THEMSELVES IN GREAT NUMBERS

THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF JUDAH AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY THAT CAME OUT OF ISRAEL AND THE SOJOURNERS WHO CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND THE SOJOURNERS WHO LIVED IN JUDAH REJOICED

SO THERE WAS GREAT JOY IN JERUSALEM FOR SINCE THE TIME OF SOLOMON THE SON OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS IN JERUSALEM

THEN THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AROSE AND BLESSED THE PEOPLE AND THEIR VOICE WAS HEARD AND THEIR PRAYER CAME TO HIS HOLY HABITATION IN HEAVEN

NOW WHEN ALL THIS WAS FINISHED ALL ISRAEL WHO WERE PRESENT WENT OUT TO THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND BROKE IN PIECES THE PILLARS AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERIM AND BROKE DOWN THE HIGH PLACES AND THE ALTARS THROUGHOUT ALL JUDAH AND BENJAMIN AND IN EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH UNTIL THEY HAD DESTROYED THEM ALL

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL RETURNED TO THEIR CITIES EVERY MAN TO HIS POSSESSION

AND HEZEKIAH APPOINTED THE DIVISIONS OF THE PRIESTS AND OF THE LEVITES DIVISION BY DIVISION EACH ACCORDING TO HIS SERVICE THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES FOR BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS TO MINISTER IN THE GATES OF THE CAMP OF THE LORD AND TO GIVE THANKS AND PRAISE

THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE KING FROM HIS OWN POSSESSIONS WAS FOR THE BURNT OFFERINGS THE BURNT OFFERINGS OF MORNING AND EVENING AND THE BURNT OFFERINGS FOR THE SABBATHS THE NEW MOONS AND THE APPOINTED FEASTS AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF THE LORD

AND HE COMMANDED THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN JERUSALEM TO GIVE THE PORTION DUE TO THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES THAT THEY MIGHT GIVE THEMSELVES TO THE LAW OF THE LORD

AS SOON AS THE COMMAND WAS SPREAD ABROAD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GAVE IN ABUNDANCE THE FIRSTFRUITS OF GRAIN WINE OIL HONEY AND OF ALL THE PRODUCE OF THE FIELD

AND THEY BROUGHT IN ABUNDANTLY THE TITHE OF EVERYTHING

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH WHO LIVED IN THE CITIES OF JUDAH ALSO BROUGHT IN THE TITHE OF CATTLE AND SHEEP AND THE TITHE OF THE DEDICATED THINGS THAT HAD BEEN DEDICATED TO THE LORD THEIR GOD AND LAID THEM IN HEAPS

IN THE THIRD MONTH THEY BEGAN TO PILE UP THE HEAPS AND FINISHED THEM IN THE SEVENTH MONTH

WHEN HEZEKIAH AND THE PRINCES CAME AND SAW THE HEAPS THEY BLESSED THE LORD AND HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND HEZEKIAH QUESTIONED THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES ABOUT THE HEAPS

AZARIAH THE CHIEF PRIEST WHO WAS OF THE HOUSE OF ZADOK ANSWERED HIM SINCE THEY BEGAN TO BRING THE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WE HAVE EATEN AND HAD ENOUGH AND HAVE PLENTY LEFT FOR THE LORD HAS BLESSED HIS PEOPLE SO THAT WE HAVE THIS LARGE AMOUNT LEFT

 THEN HEZEKIAH COMMANDED THEM TO PREPARE CHAMBERS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THEY PREPARED THEM

AND THEY FAITHFULLY BROUGHT IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS THE TITHES AND THE DEDICATED THINGS

THE CHIEF OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THEM WAS CONANIAH THE LEVITE WITH SHIMEI HIS BROTHER AS SECOND WHILE JEHIEL AZAZIAH NAHATH ASAHEL JERIMOTH JOZABAD ELIEL ISMACHIAH MAHATH AND BENAIAH WERE OVERSEERS ASSISTING CONANIAH AND SHIMEI HIS BROTHER BY THE APPOINTMENT OF HEZEKIAH THE KING AND AZARIAH THE CHIEF OFFICER OF THE HOUSE OF GOD

AND KORE THE SON OF IMNAH THE LEVITE KEEPER OF THE EAST GATE WAS OVER THE FREEWILL OFFERINGS TO GOD TO APPORTION THE CONTRIBUTION RESERVED FOR THE LORD AND THE MOST HOLY OFFERINGS

EDEN MINIAMIN JESHUA SHEMAIAH AMARIAH AND SHECANIAH WERE FAITHFULLY ASSISTING HIM IN THE CITIES OF THE PRIESTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE PORTIONS TO THEIR BROTHERS OLD AND YOUNG ALIKE BY DIVISIONS EXCEPT THOSE ENROLLED BY GENEALOGY MALES FROM THREE YEARS OLD AND UPWARDALL WHO ENTERED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AS THE DUTY OF EACH DAY REQUIREDFOR THEIR SERVICE ACCORDING TO THEIR OFFICES BY THEIR DIVISIONS

THE ENROLLMENT OF THE PRIESTS WAS ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES; THAT OF THE LEVITES FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD WAS ACCORDING TO THEIR OFFICES BY THEIR DIVISIONS

THEY WERE ENROLLED WITH ALL THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN THEIR WIVES THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY FOR THEY WERE FAITHFUL IN KEEPING THEMSELVES HOLY

AND FOR THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIESTS WHO WERE IN THE FIELDS OF COMMON LAND BELONGING TO THEIR CITIES THERE WERE MEN IN THE SEVERAL CITIES WHO WERE DESIGNATED BY NAME TO DISTRIBUTE PORTIONS TO EVERY MALE AMONG THE PRIESTS AND TO EVERYONE AMONG THE LEVITES WHO WAS ENROLLED

THUS HEZEKIAH DID THROUGHOUT ALL JUDAH AND HE DID WHAT WAS GOOD AND RIGHT AND FAITHFUL BEFORE THE LORD HIS GOD

AND EVERY WORK THAT HE UNDERTOOK IN THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF GOD AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENTS SEEKING HIS GOD HE DID WITH ALL HIS HEART AND PROSPERED

AFTER THESE THINGS AND THESE ACTS OF FAITHFULNESS SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA CAME AND INVADED JUDAH AND ENCAMPED AGAINST THE FORTIFIED CITIES THINKING TO WIN THEM FOR HIMSELF

AND WHEN HEZEKIAH SAW THAT SENNACHERIB HAD COME AND INTENDED TO FIGHT AGAINST JERUSALEM HE PLANNED WITH HIS OFFICERS AND HIS MIGHTY MEN TO STOP THE WATER OF THE SPRINGS THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE CITY; AND THEY HELPED HIM

A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AND THEY STOPPED ALL THE SPRINGS AND THE BROOK THAT FLOWED THROUGH THE LAND SAYING WHY SHOULD THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA COME AND FIND MUCH WATER

 HE SET TO WORK RESOLUTELY AND BUILT UP ALL THE WALL THAT WAS BROKEN DOWN AND RAISED TOWERS UPON IT AND OUTSIDE IT HE BUILT ANOTHER WALL AND HE STRENGTHENED THE MILLO IN THE CITY OF DAVID

HE ALSO MADE WEAPONS AND SHIELDS IN ABUNDANCE

AND HE SET COMBAT COMMANDERS OVER THE PEOPLE AND GATHERED THEM TOGETHER TO HIM IN THE SQUARE AT THE GATE OF THE CITY AND SPOKE ENCOURAGINGLY TO THEM SAYING BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

DO NOT BE AFRAID OR DISMAYED BEFORE THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND ALL THE HORDE THAT IS WITH HIM FOR THERE ARE MORE WITH US THAN WITH HIM

WITH HIM IS AN ARM OF FLESH BUT WITH US IS THE LORD OUR GOD TO HELP US AND TO FIGHT OUR BATTLES

 AND THE PEOPLE TOOK CONFIDENCE FROM THE WORDS OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH

AFTER THIS SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA WHO WAS BESIEGING LACHISH WITH ALL HIS FORCES SENT HIS SERVANTS TO JERUSALEM TO HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH WHO WERE IN JERUSALEM SAYING THUS SAYS SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA 'ON WHAT ARE YOU TRUSTING THAT YOU ENDURE THE SIEGE IN JERUSALEM

IS NOT HEZEKIAH MISLEADING YOU THAT HE MAY GIVE YOU OVER TO DIE BY FAMINE AND BY THIRST WHEN HE TELLS YOU THE LORD OUR GOD WILL DELIVER US FROM THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

HAS NOT THIS SAME HEZEKIAH TAKEN AWAY HIS HIGH PLACES AND HIS ALTARS AND COMMANDED JUDAH AND JERUSALEM BEFORE ONE ALTAR YOU SHALL WORSHIP AND ON IT YOU SHALL BURN YOUR SACRIFICES

DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT I AND MY FATHERS HAVE DONE TO ALL THE PEOPLES OF OTHER LANDS

WERE THE GODS OF THE NATIONS OF THOSE LANDS AT ALL ABLE TO DELIVER THEIR LANDS OUT OF MY HAND

WHO AMONG ALL THE GODS OF THOSE NATIONS THAT MY FATHERS DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION WAS ABLE TO DELIVER HIS PEOPLE FROM MY HAND THAT YOUR GOD SHOULD BE ABLE TO DELIVER YOU FROM MY HAND

NOW THEREFORE DO NOT LET HEZEKIAH DECEIVE YOU OR MISLEAD YOU IN THIS FASHION AND DO NOT BELIEVE HIM FOR NO GOD OF ANY NATION OR KINGDOM HAS BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER HIS PEOPLE FROM MY HAND OR FROM THE HAND OF MY FATHERS

HOW MUCH LESS WILL YOUR GOD DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HAND

' AND HIS SERVANTS SAID STILL MORE AGAINST THE LORD GOD AND AGAINST HIS SERVANT HEZEKIAH

AND HE WROTE LETTERS TO CAST CONTEMPT ON THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL AND TO SPEAK AGAINST HIM SAYING LIKE THE GODS OF THE NATIONS OF THE LANDS WHO HAVE NOT DELIVERED THEIR PEOPLE FROM MY HANDS SO THE GOD OF HEZEKIAH WILL NOT DELIVER HIS PEOPLE FROM MY HAND

 AND THEY SHOUTED IT WITH A LOUD VOICE IN THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH TO THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM WHO WERE ON THE WALL TO FRIGHTEN AND TERRIFY THEM IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THE CITY

AND THEY SPOKE OF THE GOD OF JERUSALEM AS THEY SPOKE OF THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH WHICH ARE THE WORK OF MEN'S HANDS

THEN HEZEKIAH THE KING AND ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE SON OF AMOZ PRAYED BECAUSE OF THIS AND CRIED TO HEAVEN

AND THE LORD SENT AN ANGEL WHO CUT OFF ALL THE MIGHTY WARRIORS AND COMMANDERS AND OFFICERS IN THE CAMP OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

SO HE RETURNED WITH SHAME OF FACE TO HIS OWN LAND

AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE OF HIS GOD SOME OF HIS OWN SONS STRUCK HIM DOWN THERE WITH THE SWORD

SO THE LORD SAVED HEZEKIAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FROM THE HAND OF SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA AND FROM THE HAND OF ALL HIS ENEMIES AND HE PROVIDED FOR THEM ON EVERY SIDE

AND MANY BROUGHT GIFTS TO THE LORD TO JERUSALEM AND PRECIOUS THINGS TO HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH SO THAT HE WAS EXALTED IN THE SIGHT OF ALL NATIONS FROM THAT TIME ONWARD

IN THOSE DAYS HEZEKIAH BECAME SICK AND WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH AND HE PRAYED TO THE LORD AND HE ANSWERED HIM AND GAVE HIM A SIGN

BUT HEZEKIAH DID NOT MAKE RETURN ACCORDING TO THE BENEFIT DONE TO HIM FOR HIS HEART WAS PROUD

THEREFORE WRATH CAME UPON HIM AND JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

BUT HEZEKIAH HUMBLED HIMSELF FOR THE PRIDE OF HIS HEART BOTH HE AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SO THAT THE WRATH OF THE LORD DID NOT COME UPON THEM IN THE DAYS OF HEZEKIAH

AND HEZEKIAH HAD VERY GREAT RICHES AND HONOR AND HE MADE FOR HIMSELF TREASURIES FOR SILVER FOR GOLD FOR PRECIOUS STONES FOR SPICES FOR SHIELDS AND FOR ALL KINDS OF COSTLY VESSELS; STOREHOUSES ALSO FOR THE YIELD OF GRAIN WINE AND OIL; AND STALLS FOR ALL KINDS OF CATTLE AND SHEEPFOLDS

HE LIKEWISE PROVIDED CITIES FOR HIMSELF AND FLOCKS AND HERDS IN ABUNDANCE FOR GOD HAD GIVEN HIM VERY GREAT POSSESSIONS

THIS SAME HEZEKIAH CLOSED THE UPPER OUTLET OF THE WATERS OF GIHON AND DIRECTED THEM DOWN TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE CITY OF DAVID

AND HEZEKIAH PROSPERED IN ALL HIS WORKS

AND SO IN THE MATTER OF THE ENVOYS OF THE PRINCES OF BABYLON WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE SIGN THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE LAND GOD LEFT HIM TO HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TEST HIM AND TO KNOW ALL THAT WAS IN HIS HEART

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF HEZEKIAH AND HIS GOOD DEEDS BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE VISION OF ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE SON OF AMOZ IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL

AND HEZEKIAH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TOMBS OF THE SONS OF DAVID AND ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM DID HIM HONOR AT HIS DEATH

AND MANASSEH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

MANASSEH WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FIFTYFIVE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

FOR HE REBUILT THE HIGH PLACES THAT HIS FATHER HEZEKIAH HAD BROKEN DOWN AND HE ERECTED ALTARS TO THE BAALS AND MADE ASHERAHS AND WORSHIPED ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND SERVED THEM

AND HE BUILT ALTARS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF WHICH THE LORD HAD SAID IN JERUSALEM SHALL MY NAME BE FOREVER

 AND HE BUILT ALTARS FOR ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN IN THE TWO COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE BURNED HIS SONS AS AN OFFERING IN THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM AND USED FORTUNETELLING AND OMENS AND SORCERY AND DEALT WITH MEDIUMS AND WITH WIZARDS

HE DID MUCH EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD PROVOKING HIM TO ANGER

AND THE CARVED IMAGE OF THE IDOL THAT HE HAD MADE HE SET IN THE HOUSE OF GOD OF WHICH GOD SAID TO DAVID AND TO SOLOMON HIS SON IN THIS HOUSE AND IN JERUSALEM WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL I WILL PUT MY NAME FOREVER AND I WILL NO MORE REMOVE THE FOOT OF ISRAEL FROM THE LAND THAT I APPOINTED FOR YOUR FATHERS IF ONLY THEY WILL BE CAREFUL TO DO ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED THEM ALL THE LAW THE STATUTES AND THE RULES GIVEN THROUGH MOSES

 MANASSEH LED JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM ASTRAY TO DO MORE EVIL THAN THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DESTROYED BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THE LORD SPOKE TO MANASSEH AND TO HIS PEOPLE BUT THEY PAID NO ATTENTION

THEREFORE THE LORD BROUGHT UPON THEM THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA WHO CAPTURED MANASSEH WITH HOOKS AND BOUND HIM WITH CHAINS OF BRONZE AND BROUGHT HIM TO BABYLON

AND WHEN HE WAS IN DISTRESS HE ENTREATED THE FAVOR OF THE LORD HIS GOD AND HUMBLED HIMSELF GREATLY BEFORE THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS

HE PRAYED TO HIM AND GOD WAS MOVED BY HIS ENTREATY AND HEARD HIS PLEA AND BROUGHT HIM AGAIN TO JERUSALEM INTO HIS KINGDOM

THEN MANASSEH KNEW THAT THE LORD WAS GOD

AFTERWARD HE BUILT AN OUTER WALL FOR THE CITY OF DAVID WEST OF GIHON IN THE VALLEY AND FOR THE ENTRANCE INTO THE FISH GATE AND CARRIED IT AROUND OPHEL AND RAISED IT TO A VERY GREAT HEIGHT

HE ALSO PUT COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY IN ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES IN JUDAH

AND HE TOOK AWAY THE FOREIGN GODS AND THE IDOL FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND ALL THE ALTARS THAT HE HAD BUILT ON THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND IN JERUSALEM AND HE THREW THEM OUTSIDE OF THE CITY

HE ALSO RESTORED THE ALTAR OF THE LORD AND OFFERED ON IT SACRIFICES OF PEACE OFFERINGS AND OF THANKSGIVING AND HE COMMANDED JUDAH TO SERVE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE STILL SACRIFICED AT THE HIGH PLACES BUT ONLY TO THE LORD THEIR GOD

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF MANASSEH AND HIS PRAYER TO HIS GOD AND THE WORDS OF THE SEERS WHO SPOKE TO HIM IN THE NAME OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD THEY ARE IN THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND HIS PRAYER AND HOW GOD WAS MOVED BY HIS ENTREATY AND ALL HIS SIN AND HIS FAITHLESSNESS AND THE SITES ON WHICH HE BUILT HIGH PLACES AND SET UP THE ASHERIM AND THE IMAGES BEFORE HE HUMBLED HIMSELF BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF THE SEERS

SO MANASSEH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN HIS HOUSE AND AMON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AMON WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWO YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AS MANASSEH HIS FATHER HAD DONE

AMON SACRIFICED TO ALL THE IMAGES THAT MANASSEH HIS FATHER HAD MADE AND SERVED THEM

AND HE DID NOT HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE THE LORD AS MANASSEH HIS FATHER HAD HUMBLED HIMSELF BUT THIS AMON INCURRED GUILT MORE AND MORE

AND HIS SERVANTS CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM AND PUT HIM TO DEATH IN HIS HOUSE

BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND STRUCK DOWN ALL THOSE WHO HAD CONSPIRED AGAINST KING AMON

AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND MADE JOSIAH HIS SON KING IN HIS PLACE

JOSIAH WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED THIRTYONE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND WALKED IN THE WAYS OF DAVID HIS FATHER; AND HE DID NOT TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT

FOR IN THE EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN WHILE HE WAS YET A BOY HE BEGAN TO SEEK THE GOD OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND IN THE TWELFTH YEAR HE BEGAN TO PURGE JUDAH AND JERUSALEM OF THE HIGH PLACES THE ASHERIM AND THE CARVED AND THE METAL IMAGES

AND THEY CHOPPED DOWN THE ALTARS OF THE BAALS IN HIS PRESENCE AND HE CUT DOWN THE INCENSE ALTARS THAT STOOD ABOVE THEM

AND HE BROKE IN PIECES THE ASHERIM AND THE CARVED AND THE METAL IMAGES AND HE MADE DUST OF THEM AND SCATTERED IT OVER THE GRAVES OF THOSE WHO HAD SACRIFICED TO THEM

HE ALSO BURNED THE BONES OF THE PRIESTS ON THEIR ALTARS AND CLEANSED JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

AND IN THE CITIES OF MANASSEH EPHRAIM AND SIMEON AND AS FAR AS NAPHTALI IN THEIR RUINS ALL AROUND HE BROKE DOWN THE ALTARS AND BEAT THE ASHERIM AND THE IMAGES INTO POWDER AND CUT DOWN ALL THE INCENSE ALTARS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF ISRAEL

THEN HE RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

NOW IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN WHEN HE HAD CLEANSED THE LAND AND THE HOUSE HE SENT SHAPHAN THE SON OF AZALIAH AND MAASEIAH THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY AND JOAH THE SON OF JOAHAZ THE RECORDER TO REPAIR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD HIS GOD

THEY CAME TO HILKIAH THE HIGH PRIEST AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD WHICH THE LEVITES THE KEEPERS OF THE THRESHOLD HAD COLLECTED FROM MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM AND FROM ALL THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL AND FROM ALL JUDAH AND BENJAMIN AND FROM THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

AND THEY GAVE IT TO THE WORKMEN WHO WERE WORKING IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE WORKMEN WHO WERE WORKING IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD GAVE IT FOR REPAIRING AND RESTORING THE HOUSE

THEY GAVE IT TO THE CARPENTERS AND THE BUILDERS TO BUY QUARRIED STONE AND TIMBER FOR BINDERS AND BEAMS FOR THE BUILDINGS THAT THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAD LET GO TO RUIN

AND THE MEN DID THE WORK FAITHFULLY

OVER THEM WERE SET JAHATH AND OBADIAH THE LEVITES OF THE SONS OF MERARI AND ZECHARIAH AND MESHULLAM OF THE SONS OF THE KOHATHITES TO HAVE OVERSIGHT

THE LEVITES ALL WHO WERE SKILLFUL WITH INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC WERE OVER THE BURDENBEARERS AND DIRECTED ALL WHO DID WORK IN EVERY KIND OF SERVICE AND SOME OF THE LEVITES WERE SCRIBES AND OFFICIALS AND GATEKEEPERS

WHILE THEY WERE BRINGING OUT THE MONEY THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD HILKIAH THE PRIEST FOUND THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF THE LORD GIVEN THROUGH MOSES

THEN HILKIAH ANSWERED AND SAID TO SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY I HAVE FOUND THE BOOK OF THE LAW IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 AND HILKIAH GAVE THE BOOK TO SHAPHAN

SHAPHAN BROUGHT THE BOOK TO THE KING AND FURTHER REPORTED TO THE KING ALL THAT WAS COMMITTED TO YOUR SERVANTS THEY ARE DOING

THEY HAVE EMPTIED OUT THE MONEY THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND HAVE GIVEN IT INTO THE HAND OF THE OVERSEERS AND THE WORKMEN

 THEN SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY TOLD THE KING HILKIAH THE PRIEST HAS GIVEN ME A BOOK

 AND SHAPHAN READ FROM IT BEFORE THE KING

AND WHEN THE KING HEARD THE WORDS OF THE LAW HE TORE HIS CLOTHES

AND THE KING COMMANDED HILKIAH AHIKAM THE SON OF SHAPHAN ABDON THE SON OF MICAH SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY AND ASAIAH THE KING'S SERVANT SAYING GO INQUIRE OF THE LORD FOR ME AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT IN ISRAEL AND IN JUDAH CONCERNING THE WORDS OF THE BOOK THAT HAS BEEN FOUND

FOR GREAT IS THE WRATH OF THE LORD THAT IS POURED OUT ON US BECAUSE OUR FATHERS HAVE NOT KEPT THE WORD OF THE LORD TO DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK

 SO HILKIAH AND THOSE WHOM THE KING HAD SENT WENT TO HULDAH THE PROPHETESS THE WIFE OF SHALLUM THE SON OF TOKHATH SON OF HASRAH KEEPER OF THE WARDROBE NOW SHE LIVED IN JERUSALEM IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND SPOKE TO HER TO THAT EFFECT

AND SHE SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'TELL THE MAN WHO SENT YOU TO ME THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL BRING DISASTER UPON THIS PLACE AND UPON ITS INHABITANTS ALL THE CURSES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK THAT WAS READ BEFORE THE KING OF JUDAH

BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND HAVE MADE OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS THAT THEY MIGHT PROVOKE ME TO ANGER WITH ALL THE WORKS OF THEIR HANDS THEREFORE MY WRATH WILL BE POURED OUT ON THIS PLACE AND WILL NOT BE QUENCHED

BUT TO THE KING OF JUDAH WHO SENT YOU TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL REGARDING THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD BECAUSE YOUR HEART WAS TENDER AND YOU HUMBLED YOURSELF BEFORE GOD WHEN YOU HEARD HIS WORDS AGAINST THIS PLACE AND ITS INHABITANTS AND YOU HAVE HUMBLED YOURSELF BEFORE ME AND HAVE TORN YOUR CLOTHES AND WEPT BEFORE ME I ALSO HAVE HEARD YOU DECLARES THE LORD

BEHOLD I WILL GATHER YOU TO YOUR FATHERS AND YOU SHALL BE GATHERED TO YOUR GRAVE IN PEACE AND YOUR EYES SHALL NOT SEE ALL THE DISASTER THAT I WILL BRING UPON THIS PLACE AND ITS INHABITANTS

' AND THEY BROUGHT BACK WORD TO THE KING

THEN THE KING SENT AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE ELDERS OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

AND THE KING WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WITH ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES ALL THE PEOPLE BOTH GREAT AND SMALL

AND HE READ IN THEIR HEARING ALL THE WORDS OF THE BOOK OF THE COVENANT THAT HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE KING STOOD IN HIS PLACE AND MADE A COVENANT BEFORE THE LORD TO WALK AFTER THE LORD AND TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND HIS TESTIMONIES AND HIS STATUTES WITH ALL HIS HEART AND ALL HIS SOUL TO PERFORM THE WORDS OF THE COVENANT THAT WERE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK

THEN HE MADE ALL WHO WERE PRESENT IN JERUSALEM AND IN BENJAMIN STAND TO IT

AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM DID ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT OF GOD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

AND JOSIAH TOOK AWAY ALL THE ABOMINATIONS FROM ALL THE TERRITORY THAT BELONGED TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND MADE ALL WHO WERE PRESENT IN ISRAEL SERVE THE LORD THEIR GOD

ALL HIS DAYS THEY DID NOT TURN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS

JOSIAH KEPT A PASSOVER TO THE LORD IN JERUSALEM

AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THE PASSOVER LAMB ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH

HE APPOINTED THE PRIESTS TO THEIR OFFICES AND ENCOURAGED THEM IN THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE SAID TO THE LEVITES WHO TAUGHT ALL ISRAEL AND WHO WERE HOLY TO THE LORD PUT THE HOLY ARK IN THE HOUSE THAT SOLOMON THE SON OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL BUILT

YOU NEED NOT CARRY IT ON YOUR SHOULDERS

NOW SERVE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

PREPARE YOURSELVES ACCORDING TO YOUR FATHERS' HOUSES BY YOUR DIVISIONS AS PRESCRIBED IN THE WRITING OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL AND THE DOCUMENT OF SOLOMON HIS SON

AND STAND IN THE HOLY PLACE ACCORDING TO THE GROUPINGS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF YOUR BROTHERS THE LAY PEOPLE AND ACCORDING TO THE DIVISION OF THE LEVITES BY FATHERS' HOUSEHOLD

AND SLAUGHTER THE PASSOVER LAMB AND CONSECRATE YOURSELVES AND PREPARE FOR YOUR BROTHERS TO DO ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD BY MOSES

 THEN JOSIAH CONTRIBUTED TO THE LAY PEOPLE AS PASSOVER OFFERINGS FOR ALL WHO WERE PRESENT LAMBS AND YOUNG GOATS FROM THE FLOCK TO THE NUMBER OF  AND  BULLS; THESE WERE FROM THE KING'S POSSESSIONS

AND HIS OFFICIALS CONTRIBUTED WILLINGLY TO THE PEOPLE TO THE PRIESTS AND TO THE LEVITES

HILKIAH ZECHARIAH AND JEHIEL THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD GAVE TO THE PRIESTS FOR THE PASSOVER OFFERINGS  PASSOVER LAMBS AND  BULLS

CONANIAH ALSO AND SHEMAIAH AND NETHANEL HIS BROTHERS AND HASHABIAH AND JEIEL AND JOZABAD THE CHIEFS OF THE LEVITES GAVE TO THE LEVITES FOR THE PASSOVER OFFERINGS  LAMBS AND YOUNG GOATS AND  BULLS

WHEN THE SERVICE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE PRIESTS STOOD IN THEIR PLACE AND THE LEVITES IN THEIR DIVISIONS ACCORDING TO THE KING'S COMMAND

AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THE PASSOVER LAMB AND THE PRIESTS THREW THE BLOOD THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM THEM WHILE THE LEVITES FLAYED THE SACRIFICES

AND THEY SET ASIDE THE BURNT OFFERINGS THAT THEY MIGHT DISTRIBUTE THEM ACCORDING TO THE GROUPINGS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE LAY PEOPLE TO OFFER TO THE LORD AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF MOSES

AND SO THEY DID WITH THE BULLS

AND THEY ROASTED THE PASSOVER LAMB WITH FIRE ACCORDING TO THE RULE; AND THEY BOILED THE HOLY OFFERINGS IN POTS IN CAULDRONS AND IN PANS AND CARRIED THEM QUICKLY TO ALL THE LAY PEOPLE

AND AFTERWARD THEY PREPARED FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE PRIESTS BECAUSE THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF AARON WERE OFFERING THE BURNT OFFERINGS AND THE FAT PARTS UNTIL NIGHT; SO THE LEVITES PREPARED FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF AARON

THE SINGERS THE SONS OF ASAPH WERE IN THEIR PLACE ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF DAVID AND ASAPH AND HEMAN AND JEDUTHUN THE KING'S SEER; AND THE GATEKEEPERS WERE AT EACH GATE

THEY DID NOT NEED TO DEPART FROM THEIR SERVICE FOR THEIR BROTHERS THE LEVITES PREPARED FOR THEM

SO ALL THE SERVICE OF THE LORD WAS PREPARED THAT DAY TO KEEP THE PASSOVER AND TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS ON THE ALTAR OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF KING JOSIAH

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO WERE PRESENT KEPT THE PASSOVER AT THAT TIME AND THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD SEVEN DAYS

NO PASSOVER LIKE IT HAD BEEN KEPT IN ISRAEL SINCE THE DAYS OF SAMUEL THE PROPHET

NONE OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL HAD KEPT SUCH A PASSOVER AS WAS KEPT BY JOSIAH AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND ALL JUDAH AND ISRAEL WHO WERE PRESENT AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF JOSIAH THIS PASSOVER WAS KEPT

AFTER ALL THIS WHEN JOSIAH HAD PREPARED THE TEMPLE NECO KING OF EGYPT WENT UP TO FIGHT AT CARCHEMISH ON THE EUPHRATES AND JOSIAH WENT OUT TO MEET HIM

BUT HE SENT ENVOYS TO HIM SAYING WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER KING OF JUDAH

I AM NOT COMING AGAINST YOU THIS DAY BUT AGAINST THE HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM AT WAR

AND GOD HAS COMMANDED ME TO HURRY

CEASE OPPOSING GOD WHO IS WITH ME LEST HE DESTROY YOU

 NEVERTHELESS JOSIAH DID NOT TURN AWAY FROM HIM BUT DISGUISED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO FIGHT WITH HIM

HE DID NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF NECO FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD BUT CAME TO FIGHT IN THE PLAIN OF MEGIDDO

AND THE ARCHERS SHOT KING JOSIAH

AND THE KING SAID TO HIS SERVANTS TAKE ME AWAY FOR I AM BADLY WOUNDED

 SO HIS SERVANTS TOOK HIM OUT OF THE CHARIOT AND CARRIED HIM IN HIS SECOND CHARIOT AND BROUGHT HIM TO JERUSALEM

AND HE DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE TOMBS OF HIS FATHERS

ALL JUDAH AND JERUSALEM MOURNED FOR JOSIAH

JEREMIAH ALSO UTTERED A LAMENT FOR JOSIAH; AND ALL THE SINGING MEN AND SINGING WOMEN HAVE SPOKEN OF JOSIAH IN THEIR LAMENTS TO THIS DAY

THEY MADE THESE A RULE IN ISRAEL; BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE LAMENTS

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOSIAH AND HIS GOOD DEEDS ACCORDING TO WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF THE LORD AND HIS ACTS FIRST AND LAST BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH

THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND TOOK JEHOAHAZ THE SON OF JOSIAH AND MADE HIM KING IN HIS FATHER'S PLACE IN JERUSALEM

JEHOAHAZ WAS TWENTYTHREE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED THREE MONTHS IN JERUSALEM

THEN THE KING OF EGYPT DEPOSED HIM IN JERUSALEM AND LAID ON THE LAND A TRIBUTE OF A HUNDRED TALENTS OF SILVER AND A TALENT OF GOLD

AND THE KING OF EGYPT MADE ELIAKIM HIS BROTHER KING OVER JUDAH AND JERUSALEM AND CHANGED HIS NAME TO JEHOIAKIM

BUT NECO TOOK JEHOAHAZ HIS BROTHER AND CARRIED HIM TO EGYPT

JEHOIAKIM WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD HIS GOD

AGAINST HIM CAME UP NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON AND BOUND HIM IN CHAINS TO TAKE HIM TO BABYLON

NEBUCHADNEZZAR ALSO CARRIED PART OF THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO BABYLON AND PUT THEM IN HIS PALACE IN BABYLON

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOIAKIM AND THE ABOMINATIONS THAT HE DID AND WHAT WAS FOUND AGAINST HIM BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH

AND JEHOIACHIN HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

JEHOIACHIN WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING AND HE REIGNED THREE MONTHS AND TEN DAYS IN JERUSALEM

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SENT AND BROUGHT HIM TO BABYLON WITH THE PRECIOUS VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND MADE HIS BROTHER ZEDEKIAH KING OVER JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

ZEDEKIAH WAS TWENTYONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD HIS GOD

HE DID NOT HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE JEREMIAH THE PROPHET WHO SPOKE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LORD

HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO HAD MADE HIM SWEAR BY GOD

HE STIFFENED HIS NECK AND HARDENED HIS HEART AGAINST TURNING TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE PRIESTS AND THE PEOPLE LIKEWISE WERE EXCEEDINGLY UNFAITHFUL FOLLOWING ALL THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE NATIONS

AND THEY POLLUTED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THAT HE HAD MADE HOLY IN JERUSALEM

THE LORD THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS SENT PERSISTENTLY TO THEM BY HIS MESSENGERS BECAUSE HE HAD COMPASSION ON HIS PEOPLE AND ON HIS DWELLING PLACE

BUT THEY KEPT MOCKING THE MESSENGERS OF GOD DESPISING HIS WORDS AND SCOFFING AT HIS PROPHETS UNTIL THE WRATH OF THE LORD ROSE AGAINST HIS PEOPLE UNTIL THERE WAS NO REMEDY

THEREFORE HE BROUGHT UP AGAINST THEM THE KING OF THE CHALDEANS WHO KILLED THEIR YOUNG MEN WITH THE SWORD IN THE HOUSE OF THEIR SANCTUARY AND HAD NO COMPASSION ON YOUNG MAN OR VIRGIN OLD MAN OR AGED

HE GAVE THEM ALL INTO HIS HAND

AND ALL THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD GREAT AND SMALL AND THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING AND OF HIS PRINCES ALL THESE HE BROUGHT TO BABYLON

AND THEY BURNED THE HOUSE OF GOD AND BROKE DOWN THE WALL OF JERUSALEM AND BURNED ALL ITS PALACES WITH FIRE AND DESTROYED ALL ITS PRECIOUS VESSELS

HE TOOK INTO EXILE IN BABYLON THOSE WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM THE SWORD AND THEY BECAME SERVANTS TO HIM AND TO HIS SONS UNTIL THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF PERSIA TO FULFILL THE WORD OF THE LORD BY THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH UNTIL THE LAND HAD ENJOYED ITS SABBATHS

ALL THE DAYS THAT IT LAY DESOLATE IT KEPT SABBATH TO FULFILL SEVENTY YEARS

NOW IN THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD BY THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH MIGHT BE FULFILLED THE LORD STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA SO THAT HE MADE A PROCLAMATION THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM AND ALSO PUT IT IN WRITING THUS SAYS CYRUS KING OF PERSIA 'THE LORD THE GOD OF HEAVEN HAS GIVEN ME ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH AND HE HAS CHARGED ME TO BUILD HIM A HOUSE AT JERUSALEM WHICH IS IN JUDAH

WHOEVER IS AMONG YOU OF ALL HIS PEOPLE MAY THE LORD HIS GOD BE WITH HIM

LET HIM GO UP

'HOSEATHE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO HOSEA THE SON OF BEERI IN THE DAYS OF UZZIAH JOTHAM AHAZ AND HEZEKIAH KINGS OF JUDAH AND IN THE DAYS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF JOASH KING OF ISRAEL

WHEN THE LORD FIRST SPOKE THROUGH HOSEA THE LORD SAID TO HOSEA GO TAKE TO YOURSELF A WIFE OF WHOREDOM AND HAVE CHILDREN OF WHOREDOM FOR THE LAND COMMITS GREAT WHOREDOM BY FORSAKING THE LORD

 SO HE WENT AND TOOK GOMER THE DAUGHTER OF DIBLAIM AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE HIM A SON

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM CALL HIS NAME JEZREEL FOR IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE I WILL PUNISH THE HOUSE OF JEHU FOR THE BLOOD OF JEZREEL AND I WILL PUT AN END TO THE KINGDOM OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AND ON THAT DAY I WILL BREAK THE BOW OF ISRAEL IN THE VALLEY OF JEZREEL

 SHE CONCEIVED AGAIN AND BORE A DAUGHTER

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM CALL HER NAME NO MERCY FOR I WILL NO MORE HAVE MERCY ON THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO FORGIVE THEM AT ALL

BUT I WILL HAVE MERCY ON THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND I WILL SAVE THEM BY THE LORD THEIR GOD

I WILL NOT SAVE THEM BY BOW OR BY SWORD OR BY WAR OR BY HORSES OR BY HORSEMEN

 WHEN SHE HAD WEANED NO MERCY SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON

AND THE LORD SAID CALL HIS NAME NOT MY PEOPLE FOR YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE AND I AM NOT YOUR GOD

 YET THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED OR NUMBERED

AND IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE IT SHALL BE SAID TO THEM CHILDREN OF THE LIVING GOD

 AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER AND THEY SHALL APPOINT FOR THEMSELVES ONE HEAD

AND THEY SHALL GO UP FROM THE LAND FOR GREAT SHALL BE THE DAY OF JEZREEL

SAY TO YOUR BROTHERS YOU ARE MY PEOPLE AND TO YOUR SISTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED MERCY

 PLEAD WITH YOUR MOTHER PLEADFOR SHE IS NOT MY WIFE AND I AM NOT HER HUSBANDTHAT SHE PUT AWAY HER WHORING FROM HER FACE AND HER ADULTERY FROM BETWEEN HER BREASTS; LEST I STRIP HER NAKED AND MAKE HER AS IN THE DAY SHE WAS BORN AND MAKE HER LIKE A WILDERNESS AND MAKE HER LIKE A PARCHED LAND AND KILL HER WITH THIRST

UPON HER CHILDREN ALSO I WILL HAVE NO MERCY BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN OF WHOREDOM

FOR THEIR MOTHER HAS PLAYED THE WHORE; SHE WHO CONCEIVED THEM HAS ACTED SHAMEFULLY

FOR SHE SAID 'I WILL GO AFTER MY LOVERS WHO GIVE ME MY BREAD AND MY WATER MY WOOL AND MY FLAX MY OIL AND MY DRINK

' THEREFORE I WILL HEDGE UP HER WAY WITH THORNS AND I WILL BUILD A WALL AGAINST HER SO THAT SHE CANNOT FIND HER PATHS

SHE SHALL PURSUE HER LOVERS BUT NOT OVERTAKE THEM AND SHE SHALL SEEK THEM BUT SHALL NOT FIND THEM

THEN SHE SHALL SAY 'I WILL GO AND RETURN TO MY FIRST HUSBAND FOR IT WAS BETTER FOR ME THEN THAN NOW

' AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS I WHO GAVE HER THE GRAIN THE WINE AND THE OIL AND WHO LAVISHED ON HER SILVER AND GOLD WHICH THEY USED FOR BAAL

THEREFORE I WILL TAKE BACK MY GRAIN IN ITS TIME AND MY WINE IN ITS SEASON AND I WILL TAKE AWAY MY WOOL AND MY FLAX WHICH WERE TO COVER HER NAKEDNESS

NOW I WILL UNCOVER HER LEWDNESS IN THE SIGHT OF HER LOVERS AND NO ONE SHALL RESCUE HER OUT OF MY HAND

AND I WILL PUT AN END TO ALL HER MIRTH HER FEASTS HER NEW MOONS HER SABBATHS AND ALL HER APPOINTED FEASTS

AND I WILL LAY WASTE HER VINES AND HER FIG TREES OF WHICH SHE SAID 'THESE ARE MY WAGES WHICH MY LOVERS HAVE GIVEN ME

' I WILL MAKE THEM A FOREST AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD SHALL DEVOUR THEM

AND I WILL PUNISH HER FOR THE FEAST DAYS OF THE BAALS WHEN SHE BURNED OFFERINGS TO THEM AND ADORNED HERSELF WITH HER RING AND JEWELRY AND WENT AFTER HER LOVERS AND FORGOT ME DECLARES THE LORD

THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL ALLURE HER AND BRING HER INTO THE WILDERNESS AND SPEAK TENDERLY TO HER

AND THERE I WILL GIVE HER HER VINEYARDS AND MAKE THE VALLEY OF ACHOR A DOOR OF HOPE

AND THERE SHE SHALL ANSWER AS IN THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH AS AT THE TIME WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD YOU WILL CALL ME 'MY HUSBAND' AND NO LONGER WILL YOU CALL ME 'MY BAAL

' FOR I WILL REMOVE THE NAMES OF THE BAALS FROM HER MOUTH AND THEY SHALL BE REMEMBERED BY NAME NO MORE

AND I WILL MAKE FOR THEM A COVENANT ON THAT DAY WITH THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE CREEPING THINGS OF THE GROUND

AND I WILL ABOLISH THE BOW THE SWORD AND WAR FROM THE LAND AND I WILL MAKE YOU LIE DOWN IN SAFETY

AND I WILL BETROTH YOU TO ME FOREVER

I WILL BETROTH YOU TO ME IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IN JUSTICE IN STEADFAST LOVE AND IN MERCY

I WILL BETROTH YOU TO ME IN FAITHFULNESS

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THE LORD

AND IN THAT DAY I WILL ANSWER DECLARES THE LORD I WILL ANSWER THE HEAVENS AND THEY SHALL ANSWER THE EARTH AND THE EARTH SHALL ANSWER THE GRAIN THE WINE AND THE OIL AND THEY SHALL ANSWER JEZREEL AND I WILL SOW HER FOR MYSELF IN THE LAND

AND I WILL HAVE MERCY ON NO MERCY AND I WILL SAY TO NOT MY PEOPLE 'YOU ARE MY PEOPLE'; AND HE SHALL SAY 'YOU ARE MY GOD

'AND THE LORD SAID TO ME GO AGAIN LOVE A WOMAN WHO IS LOVED BY ANOTHER MAN AND IS AN ADULTERESS EVEN AS THE LORD LOVES THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THOUGH THEY TURN TO OTHER GODS AND LOVE CAKES OF RAISINS

 SO I BOUGHT HER FOR FIFTEEN SHEKELS OF SILVER AND A HOMER AND A LETHECH OF BARLEY

AND I SAID TO HER YOU MUST DWELL AS MINE FOR MANY DAYS

YOU SHALL NOT PLAY THE WHORE OR BELONG TO ANOTHER MAN; SO WILL I ALSO BE TO YOU

 FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL DWELL MANY DAYS WITHOUT KING OR PRINCE WITHOUT SACRIFICE OR PILLAR WITHOUT EPHOD OR HOUSEHOLD GODS

AFTERWARD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL RETURN AND SEEK THE LORD THEIR GOD AND DAVID THEIR KING AND THEY SHALL COME IN FEAR TO THE LORD AND TO HIS GOODNESS IN THE LATTER DAYS

HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD O CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FOR THE LORD HAS A CONTROVERSY WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

THERE IS NO FAITHFULNESS OR STEADFAST LOVE AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF GOD IN THE LAND; THERE IS SWEARING LYING MURDER STEALING AND COMMITTING ADULTERY; THEY BREAK ALL BOUNDS AND BLOODSHED FOLLOWS BLOODSHED

THEREFORE THE LAND MOURNS AND ALL WHO DWELL IN IT LANGUISH AND ALSO THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND EVEN THE FISH OF THE SEA ARE TAKEN AWAY

YET LET NO ONE CONTEND AND LET NONE ACCUSE FOR WITH YOU IS MY CONTENTION O PRIEST

YOU SHALL STUMBLE BY DAY; THE PROPHET ALSO SHALL STUMBLE WITH YOU BY NIGHT; AND I WILL DESTROY YOUR MOTHER

MY PEOPLE ARE DESTROYED FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE; BECAUSE YOU HAVE REJECTED KNOWLEDGE I REJECT YOU FROM BEING A PRIEST TO ME

AND SINCE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE LAW OF YOUR GOD I ALSO WILL FORGET YOUR CHILDREN

THE MORE THEY INCREASED THE MORE THEY SINNED AGAINST ME; I WILL CHANGE THEIR GLORY INTO SHAME

THEY FEED ON THE SIN OF MY PEOPLE; THEY ARE GREEDY FOR THEIR INIQUITY

AND IT SHALL BE LIKE PEOPLE LIKE PRIEST; I WILL PUNISH THEM FOR THEIR WAYS AND REPAY THEM FOR THEIR DEEDS

THEY SHALL EAT BUT NOT BE SATISFIED; THEY SHALL PLAY THE WHORE BUT NOT MULTIPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD TO CHERISH WHOREDOM WINE AND NEW WINE WHICH TAKE AWAY THE UNDERSTANDING

MY PEOPLE INQUIRE OF A PIECE OF WOOD AND THEIR WALKING STAFF GIVES THEM ORACLES

FOR A SPIRIT OF WHOREDOM HAS LED THEM ASTRAY AND THEY HAVE LEFT THEIR GOD TO PLAY THE WHORE

THEY SACRIFICE ON THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND BURN OFFERINGS ON THE HILLS UNDER OAK POPLAR AND TEREBINTH BECAUSE THEIR SHADE IS GOOD

THEREFORE YOUR DAUGHTERS PLAY THE WHORE AND YOUR BRIDES COMMIT ADULTERY

I WILL NOT PUNISH YOUR DAUGHTERS WHEN THEY PLAY THE WHORE NOR YOUR BRIDES WHEN THEY COMMIT ADULTERY; FOR THE MEN THEMSELVES GO ASIDE WITH PROSTITUTES AND SACRIFICE WITH CULT PROSTITUTES AND A PEOPLE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING SHALL COME TO RUIN

THOUGH YOU PLAY THE WHORE O ISRAEL LET NOT JUDAH BECOME GUILTY

ENTER NOT INTO GILGAL NOR GO UP TO BETHAVEN AND SWEAR NOT AS THE LORD LIVES

 LIKE A STUBBORN HEIFER ISRAEL IS STUBBORN; CAN THE LORD NOW FEED THEM LIKE A LAMB IN A BROAD PASTURE

EPHRAIM IS JOINED TO IDOLS; LEAVE HIM ALONE

WHEN THEIR DRINK IS GONE THEY GIVE THEMSELVES TO WHORING; THEIR RULERS DEARLY LOVE SHAME

A WIND HAS WRAPPED THEM IN ITS WINGS AND THEY SHALL BE ASHAMED BECAUSE OF THEIR SACRIFICES

HEAR THIS O PRIESTS

PAY ATTENTION O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

GIVE EAR O HOUSE OF THE KING

FOR THE JUDGMENT IS FOR YOU; FOR YOU HAVE BEEN A SNARE AT MIZPAH AND A NET SPREAD UPON TABOR

AND THE REVOLTERS HAVE GONE DEEP INTO SLAUGHTER BUT I WILL DISCIPLINE ALL OF THEM

I KNOW EPHRAIM AND ISRAEL IS NOT HIDDEN FROM ME; FOR NOW O EPHRAIM YOU HAVE PLAYED THE WHORE; ISRAEL IS DEFILED

THEIR DEEDS DO NOT PERMIT THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR GOD

FOR THE SPIRIT OF WHOREDOM IS WITHIN THEM AND THEY KNOW NOT THE LORD

THE PRIDE OF ISRAEL TESTIFIES TO HIS FACE; ISRAEL AND EPHRAIM SHALL STUMBLE IN HIS GUILT; JUDAH ALSO SHALL STUMBLE WITH THEM

WITH THEIR FLOCKS AND HERDS THEY SHALL GO TO SEEK THE LORD BUT THEY WILL NOT FIND HIM; HE HAS WITHDRAWN FROM THEM

THEY HAVE DEALT FAITHLESSLY WITH THE LORD; FOR THEY HAVE BORNE ALIEN CHILDREN

NOW THE NEW MOON SHALL DEVOUR THEM WITH THEIR FIELDS

BLOW THE HORN IN GIBEAH THE TRUMPET IN RAMAH

SOUND THE ALARM AT BETHAVEN; WE FOLLOW YOU O BENJAMIN

EPHRAIM SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION IN THE DAY OF PUNISHMENT; AMONG THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL I MAKE KNOWN WHAT IS SURE

THE PRINCES OF JUDAH HAVE BECOME LIKE THOSE WHO MOVE THE LANDMARK; UPON THEM I WILL POUR OUT MY WRATH LIKE WATER

EPHRAIM IS OPPRESSED CRUSHED IN JUDGMENT BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO AFTER FILTH

BUT I AM LIKE A MOTH TO EPHRAIM AND LIKE DRY ROT TO THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

WHEN EPHRAIM SAW HIS SICKNESS AND JUDAH HIS WOUND THEN EPHRAIM WENT TO ASSYRIA AND SENT TO THE GREAT KING

BUT HE IS NOT ABLE TO CURE YOU OR HEAL YOUR WOUND

FOR I WILL BE LIKE A LION TO EPHRAIM AND LIKE A YOUNG LION TO THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

I EVEN I WILL TEAR AND GO AWAY; I WILL CARRY OFF AND NO ONE SHALL RESCUE

I WILL RETURN AGAIN TO MY PLACE UNTIL THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR GUILT AND SEEK MY FACE AND IN THEIR DISTRESS EARNESTLY SEEK ME

COME LET US RETURN TO THE LORD; FOR HE HAS TORN US THAT HE MAY HEAL US; HE HAS STRUCK US DOWN AND HE WILL BIND US UP

AFTER TWO DAYS HE WILL REVIVE US; ON THE THIRD DAY HE WILL RAISE US UP THAT WE MAY LIVE BEFORE HIM

LET US KNOW; LET US PRESS ON TO KNOW THE LORD; HIS GOING OUT IS SURE AS THE DAWN; HE WILL COME TO US AS THE SHOWERS AS THE SPRING RAINS THAT WATER THE EARTH

 WHAT SHALL I DO WITH YOU O EPHRAIM

WHAT SHALL I DO WITH YOU O JUDAH

YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A MORNING CLOUD LIKE THE DEW THAT GOES EARLY AWAY

THEREFORE I HAVE HEWN THEM BY THE PROPHETS; I HAVE SLAIN THEM BY THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH AND MY JUDGMENT GOES FORTH AS THE LIGHT

FOR I DESIRE STEADFAST LOVE AND NOT SACRIFICE THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD RATHER THAN BURNT OFFERINGS

BUT LIKE ADAM THEY TRANSGRESSED THE COVENANT; THERE THEY DEALT FAITHLESSLY WITH ME

GILEAD IS A CITY OF EVILDOERS TRACKED WITH BLOOD

AS ROBBERS LIE IN WAIT FOR A MAN SO THE PRIESTS BAND TOGETHER; THEY MURDER ON THE WAY TO SHECHEM; THEY COMMIT VILLAINY

IN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL I HAVE SEEN A HORRIBLE THING; EPHRAIM'S WHOREDOM IS THERE; ISRAEL IS DEFILED

FOR YOU ALSO O JUDAH A HARVEST IS APPOINTED WHEN I RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF MY PEOPLE

WHEN I WOULD HEAL ISRAEL THE INIQUITY OF EPHRAIM IS REVEALED AND THE EVIL DEEDS OF SAMARIA; FOR THEY DEAL FALSELY; THE THIEF BREAKS IN AND THE BANDITS RAID OUTSIDE

BUT THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THAT I REMEMBER ALL THEIR EVIL

NOW THEIR DEEDS SURROUND THEM; THEY ARE BEFORE MY FACE

BY THEIR EVIL THEY MAKE THE KING GLAD AND THE PRINCES BY THEIR TREACHERY

THEY ARE ALL ADULTERERS; THEY ARE LIKE A HEATED OVEN WHOSE BAKER CEASES TO STIR THE FIRE FROM THE KNEADING OF THE DOUGH UNTIL IT IS LEAVENED

ON THE DAY OF OUR KING THE PRINCES BECAME SICK WITH THE HEAT OF WINE; HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND WITH MOCKERS

FOR WITH HEARTS LIKE AN OVEN THEY APPROACH THEIR INTRIGUE; ALL NIGHT THEIR ANGER SMOLDERS; IN THE MORNING IT BLAZES LIKE A FLAMING FIRE

ALL OF THEM ARE HOT AS AN OVEN AND THEY DEVOUR THEIR RULERS

ALL THEIR KINGS HAVE FALLEN AND NONE OF THEM CALLS UPON ME

EPHRAIM MIXES HIMSELF WITH THE PEOPLES; EPHRAIM IS A CAKE NOT TURNED

STRANGERS DEVOUR HIS STRENGTH AND HE KNOWS IT NOT; GRAY HAIRS ARE SPRINKLED UPON HIM AND HE KNOWS IT NOT

THE PRIDE OF ISRAEL TESTIFIES TO HIS FACE; YET THEY DO NOT RETURN TO THE LORD THEIR GOD NOR SEEK HIM FOR ALL THIS

EPHRAIM IS LIKE A DOVE SILLY AND WITHOUT SENSE CALLING TO EGYPT GOING TO ASSYRIA

AS THEY GO I WILL SPREAD OVER THEM MY NET; I WILL BRING THEM DOWN LIKE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS; I WILL DISCIPLINE THEM ACCORDING TO THE REPORT MADE TO THEIR CONGREGATION

WOE TO THEM FOR THEY HAVE STRAYED FROM ME

DESTRUCTION TO THEM FOR THEY HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

I WOULD REDEEM THEM BUT THEY SPEAK LIES AGAINST ME

THEY DO NOT CRY TO ME FROM THE HEART BUT THEY WAIL UPON THEIR BEDS; FOR GRAIN AND WINE THEY GASH THEMSELVES; THEY REBEL AGAINST ME

ALTHOUGH I TRAINED AND STRENGTHENED THEIR ARMS YET THEY DEVISE EVIL AGAINST ME

THEY RETURN BUT NOT UPWARD; THEY ARE LIKE A TREACHEROUS BOW; THEIR PRINCES SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD BECAUSE OF THE INSOLENCE OF THEIR TONGUE

THIS SHALL BE THEIR DERISION IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

SET THE TRUMPET TO YOUR LIPS

ONE LIKE A VULTURE IS OVER THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRANSGRESSED MY COVENANT AND REBELLED AGAINST MY LAW

TO ME THEY CRY MY GOD WEISRAELKNOW YOU

ISRAEL HAS SPURNED THE GOOD; THE ENEMY SHALL PURSUE HIM

THEY MADE KINGS BUT NOT THROUGH ME

THEY SET UP PRINCES BUT I KNEW IT NOT

WITH THEIR SILVER AND GOLD THEY MADE IDOLS FOR THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION

I HAVE SPURNED YOUR CALF O SAMARIA

MY ANGER BURNS AGAINST THEM

HOW LONG WILL THEY BE INCAPABLE OF INNOCENCE

FOR IT IS FROM ISRAEL; A CRAFTSMAN MADE IT; IT IS NOT GOD

THE CALF OF SAMARIA SHALL BE BROKEN TO PIECES

FOR THEY SOW THE WIND AND THEY SHALL REAP THE WHIRLWIND

THE STANDING GRAIN HAS NO HEADS; IT SHALL YIELD NO FLOUR; IF IT WERE TO YIELD STRANGERS WOULD DEVOUR IT

ISRAEL IS SWALLOWED UP; ALREADY THEY ARE AMONG THE NATIONS AS A USELESS VESSEL

FOR THEY HAVE GONE UP TO ASSYRIA A WILD DONKEY WANDERING ALONE; EPHRAIM HAS HIRED LOVERS

THOUGH THEY HIRE ALLIES AMONG THE NATIONS I WILL SOON GATHER THEM UP

AND THE KING AND PRINCES SHALL SOON WRITHE BECAUSE OF THE TRIBUTE

BECAUSE EPHRAIM HAS MULTIPLIED ALTARS FOR SINNING THEY HAVE BECOME TO HIM ALTARS FOR SINNING

WERE I TO WRITE FOR HIM MY LAWS BY THE TEN THOUSANDS THEY WOULD BE REGARDED AS A STRANGE THING

AS FOR MY SACRIFICIAL OFFERINGS THEY SACRIFICE MEAT AND EAT IT BUT THE LORD DOES NOT ACCEPT THEM

NOW HE WILL REMEMBER THEIR INIQUITY AND PUNISH THEIR SINS; THEY SHALL RETURN TO EGYPT

FOR ISRAEL HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MAKER AND BUILT PALACES AND JUDAH HAS MULTIPLIED FORTIFIED CITIES; SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON HIS CITIES AND IT SHALL DEVOUR HER STRONGHOLDS

REJOICE NOT O ISRAEL

EXULT NOT LIKE THE PEOPLES; FOR YOU HAVE PLAYED THE WHORE FORSAKING YOUR GOD

YOU HAVE LOVED A PROSTITUTE'S WAGES ON ALL THRESHING FLOORS

THRESHING FLOOR AND WINE VAT SHALL NOT FEED THEM AND THE NEW WINE SHALL FAIL THEM

THEY SHALL NOT REMAIN IN THE LAND OF THE LORD BUT EPHRAIM SHALL RETURN TO EGYPT AND THEY SHALL EAT UNCLEAN FOOD IN ASSYRIA

THEY SHALL NOT POUR DRINK OFFERINGS OF WINE TO THE LORD AND THEIR SACRIFICES SHALL NOT PLEASE HIM

IT SHALL BE LIKE MOURNERS' BREAD TO THEM; ALL WHO EAT OF IT SHALL BE DEFILED; FOR THEIR BREAD SHALL BE FOR THEIR HUNGER ONLY; IT SHALL NOT COME TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

WHAT WILL YOU DO ON THE DAY OF THE APPOINTED FESTIVAL AND ON THE DAY OF THE FEAST OF THE LORD

FOR BEHOLD THEY ARE GOING AWAY FROM DESTRUCTION; BUT EGYPT SHALL GATHER THEM; MEMPHIS SHALL BURY THEM

NETTLES SHALL POSSESS THEIR PRECIOUS THINGS OF SILVER; THORNS SHALL BE IN THEIR TENTS

THE DAYS OF PUNISHMENT HAVE COME; THE DAYS OF RECOMPENSE HAVE COME; ISRAEL SHALL KNOW IT

THE PROPHET IS A FOOL; THE MAN OF THE SPIRIT IS MAD BECAUSE OF YOUR GREAT INIQUITY AND GREAT HATRED

THE PROPHET IS THE WATCHMAN OF EPHRAIM WITH MY GOD; YET A FOWLER'S SNARE IS ON ALL HIS WAYS AND HATRED IN THE HOUSE OF HIS GOD

THEY HAVE DEEPLY CORRUPTED THEMSELVES AS IN THE DAYS OF GIBEAH HE WILL REMEMBER THEIR INIQUITY; HE WILL PUNISH THEIR SINS

LIKE GRAPES IN THE WILDERNESS I FOUND ISRAEL

LIKE THE FIRST FRUIT ON THE FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON I SAW YOUR FATHERS

BUT THEY CAME TO BAALPEOR AND CONSECRATED THEMSELVES TO THE THING OF SHAME AND BECAME DETESTABLE LIKE THE THING THEY LOVED

EPHRAIM'S GLORY SHALL FLY AWAY LIKE A BIRDNO BIRTH NO PREGNANCY NO CONCEPTION

EVEN IF THEY BRING UP CHILDREN I WILL BEREAVE THEM TILL NONE IS LEFT

WOE TO THEM WHEN I DEPART FROM THEM

EPHRAIM AS I HAVE SEEN WAS LIKE A YOUNG PALM PLANTED IN A MEADOW; BUT EPHRAIM MUST LEAD HIS CHILDREN OUT TO SLAUGHTER

GIVE THEM O LORDWHAT WILL YOU GIVE

GIVE THEM A MISCARRYING WOMB AND DRY BREASTS

EVERY EVIL OF THEIRS IS IN GILGAL; THERE I BEGAN TO HATE THEM

BECAUSE OF THE WICKEDNESS OF THEIR DEEDS I WILL DRIVE THEM OUT OF MY HOUSE

I WILL LOVE THEM NO MORE; ALL THEIR PRINCES ARE REBELS

EPHRAIM IS STRICKEN; THEIR ROOT IS DRIED UP; THEY SHALL BEAR NO FRUIT

EVEN THOUGH THEY GIVE BIRTH I WILL PUT THEIR BELOVED CHILDREN TO DEATH

MY GOD WILL REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT LISTENED TO HIM; THEY SHALL BE WANDERERS AMONG THE NATIONS

ISRAEL IS A LUXURIANT VINE THAT YIELDS ITS FRUIT

THE MORE HIS FRUIT INCREASED THE MORE ALTARS HE BUILT; AS HIS COUNTRY IMPROVED HE IMPROVED HIS PILLARS

THEIR HEART IS FALSE; NOW THEY MUST BEAR THEIR GUILT

THE LORD WILL BREAK DOWN THEIR ALTARS AND DESTROY THEIR PILLARS

FOR NOW THEY WILL SAY WE HAVE NO KING FOR WE DO NOT FEAR THE LORD; AND A KINGWHAT COULD HE DO FOR US

 THEY UTTER MERE WORDS; WITH EMPTY OATHS THEY MAKE COVENANTS; SO JUDGMENT SPRINGS UP LIKE POISONOUS WEEDS IN THE FURROWS OF THE FIELD

THE INHABITANTS OF SAMARIA TREMBLE FOR THE CALF OF BETHAVEN

ITS PEOPLE MOURN FOR IT AND SO DO ITS IDOLATROUS PRIESTSTHOSE WHO REJOICED OVER IT AND OVER ITS GLORYFOR IT HAS DEPARTED FROM THEM

THE THING ITSELF SHALL BE CARRIED TO ASSYRIA AS TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT KING

EPHRAIM SHALL BE PUT TO SHAME AND ISRAEL SHALL BE ASHAMED OF HIS IDOL

SAMARIA'S KING SHALL PERISH LIKE A TWIG ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS

THE HIGH PLACES OF AVEN THE SIN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE DESTROYED

THORN AND THISTLE SHALL GROW UP ON THEIR ALTARS AND THEY SHALL SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS COVER US AND TO THE HILLS FALL ON US

FROM THE DAYS OF GIBEAH YOU HAVE SINNED O ISRAEL; THERE THEY HAVE CONTINUED

SHALL NOT THE WAR AGAINST THE UNJUST OVERTAKE THEM IN GIBEAH

WHEN I PLEASE I WILL DISCIPLINE THEM AND NATIONS SHALL BE GATHERED AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY ARE BOUND UP FOR THEIR DOUBLE INIQUITY

EPHRAIM WAS A TRAINED CALF THAT LOVED TO THRESH AND I SPARED HER FAIR NECK; BUT I WILL PUT EPHRAIM TO THE YOKE; JUDAH MUST PLOW; JACOB MUST HARROW FOR HIMSELF

SOW FOR YOURSELVES RIGHTEOUSNESS; REAP STEADFAST LOVE; BREAK UP YOUR FALLOW GROUND FOR IT IS THE TIME TO SEEK THE LORD THAT HE MAY COME AND RAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS UPON YOU

YOU HAVE PLOWED INIQUITY; YOU HAVE REAPED INJUSTICE; YOU HAVE EATEN THE FRUIT OF LIES

BECAUSE YOU HAVE TRUSTED IN YOUR OWN WAY AND IN THE MULTITUDE OF YOUR WARRIORS THEREFORE THE TUMULT OF WAR SHALL ARISE AMONG YOUR PEOPLE AND ALL YOUR FORTRESSES SHALL BE DESTROYED AS SHALMAN DESTROYED BETHARBEL ON THE DAY OF BATTLE; MOTHERS WERE DASHED IN PIECES WITH THEIR CHILDREN

THUS IT SHALL BE DONE TO YOU O BETHEL BECAUSE OF YOUR GREAT EVIL

AT DAWN THE KING OF ISRAEL SHALL BE UTTERLY CUT OFF

WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD I LOVED HIM AND OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON

THE MORE THEY WERE CALLED THE MORE THEY WENT AWAY; THEY KEPT SACRIFICING TO THE BAALS AND BURNING OFFERINGS TO IDOLS

YET IT WAS I WHO TAUGHT EPHRAIM TO WALK; I TOOK THEM UP BY THEIR ARMS BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT I HEALED THEM

I LED THEM WITH CORDS OF KINDNESS WITH THE BANDS OF LOVE AND I BECAME TO THEM AS ONE WHO EASES THE YOKE ON THEIR JAWS AND I BENT DOWN TO THEM AND FED THEM

THEY SHALL NOT RETURN TO THE LAND OF EGYPT BUT ASSYRIA SHALL BE THEIR KING BECAUSE THEY HAVE REFUSED TO RETURN TO ME

THE SWORD SHALL RAGE AGAINST THEIR CITIES CONSUME THE BARS OF THEIR GATES AND DEVOUR THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN COUNSELS

MY PEOPLE ARE BENT ON TURNING AWAY FROM ME AND THOUGH THEY CALL OUT TO THE MOST HIGH HE SHALL NOT RAISE THEM UP AT ALL

HOW CAN I GIVE YOU UP O EPHRAIM

HOW CAN I HAND YOU OVER O ISRAEL

HOW CAN I MAKE YOU LIKE ADMAH

HOW CAN I TREAT YOU LIKE ZEBOIIM

MY HEART RECOILS WITHIN ME; MY COMPASSION GROWS WARM AND TENDER

I WILL NOT EXECUTE MY BURNING ANGER; I WILL NOT AGAIN DESTROY EPHRAIM; FOR I AM GOD AND NOT A MAN THE HOLY ONE IN YOUR MIDST AND I WILL NOT COME IN WRATH

THEY SHALL GO AFTER THE LORD; HE WILL ROAR LIKE A LION; WHEN HE ROARS HIS CHILDREN SHALL COME TREMBLING FROM THE WEST; THEY SHALL COME TREMBLING LIKE BIRDS FROM EGYPT AND LIKE DOVES FROM THE LAND OF ASSYRIA AND I WILL RETURN THEM TO THEIR HOMES DECLARES THE LORD

EPHRAIM HAS SURROUNDED ME WITH LIES AND THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH DECEIT BUT JUDAH STILL WALKS WITH GOD AND IS FAITHFUL TO THE HOLY ONE

EPHRAIM FEEDS ON THE WIND AND PURSUES THE EAST WIND ALL DAY LONG; THEY MULTIPLY FALSEHOOD AND VIOLENCE; THEY MAKE A COVENANT WITH ASSYRIA AND OIL IS CARRIED TO EGYPT

THE LORD HAS AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JUDAH AND WILL PUNISH JACOB ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS; HE WILL REPAY HIM ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS

IN THE WOMB HE TOOK HIS BROTHER BY THE HEEL AND IN HIS MANHOOD HE STROVE WITH GOD

HE STROVE WITH THE ANGEL AND PREVAILED; HE WEPT AND SOUGHT HIS FAVOR

HE MET GOD AT BETHEL AND THERE GOD SPOKE WITH US THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS THE LORD IS HIS MEMORIAL NAME SO YOU BY THE HELP OF YOUR GOD RETURN HOLD FAST TO LOVE AND JUSTICE AND WAIT CONTINUALLY FOR YOUR GOD

 A MERCHANT IN WHOSE HANDS ARE FALSE BALANCES HE LOVES TO OPPRESS

EPHRAIM HAS SAID AH BUT I AM RICH; I HAVE FOUND WEALTH FOR MYSELF; IN ALL MY LABORS THEY CANNOT FIND IN ME INIQUITY OR SIN

 I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT; I WILL AGAIN MAKE YOU DWELL IN TENTS AS IN THE DAYS OF THE APPOINTED FEAST

I SPOKE TO THE PROPHETS; IT WAS I WHO MULTIPLIED VISIONS AND THROUGH THE PROPHETS GAVE PARABLES

IF THERE IS INIQUITY IN GILEAD THEY SHALL SURELY COME TO NOTHING IN GILGAL THEY SACRIFICE BULLS; THEIR ALTARS ALSO ARE LIKE STONE HEAPS ON THE FURROWS OF THE FIELD

JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM; THERE ISRAEL SERVED FOR A WIFE AND FOR A WIFE HE GUARDED SHEEP

BY A PROPHET THE LORD BROUGHT ISRAEL UP FROM EGYPT AND BY A PROPHET HE WAS GUARDED

EPHRAIM HAS GIVEN BITTER PROVOCATION; SO HIS LORD WILL LEAVE HIS BLOODGUILT ON HIM AND WILL REPAY HIM FOR HIS DISGRACEFUL DEEDS

WHEN EPHRAIM SPOKE THERE WAS TREMBLING; HE WAS EXALTED IN ISRAEL BUT HE INCURRED GUILT THROUGH BAAL AND DIED

AND NOW THEY SIN MORE AND MORE AND MAKE FOR THEMSELVES METAL IMAGES IDOLS SKILLFULLY MADE OF THEIR SILVER ALL OF THEM THE WORK OF CRAFTSMEN

IT IS SAID OF THEM THOSE WHO OFFER HUMAN SACRIFICE KISS CALVES

 THEREFORE THEY SHALL BE LIKE THE MORNING MIST OR LIKE THE DEW THAT GOES EARLY AWAY LIKE THE CHAFF THAT SWIRLS FROM THE THRESHING FLOOR OR LIKE SMOKE FROM A WINDOW

BUT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT; YOU KNOW NO GOD BUT ME AND BESIDES ME THERE IS NO SAVIOR

IT WAS I WHO KNEW YOU IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE LAND OF DROUGHT; BUT WHEN THEY HAD GRAZED THEY BECAME FULL THEY WERE FILLED AND THEIR HEART WAS LIFTED UP; THEREFORE THEY FORGOT ME

SO I AM TO THEM LIKE A LION; LIKE A LEOPARD I WILL LURK BESIDE THE WAY

I WILL FALL UPON THEM LIKE A BEAR ROBBED OF HER CUBS; I WILL TEAR OPEN THEIR BREAST AND THERE I WILL DEVOUR THEM LIKE A LION AS A WILD BEAST WOULD RIP THEM OPEN

HE DESTROYS YOU O ISRAEL FOR YOU ARE AGAINST ME AGAINST YOUR HELPER

WHERE NOW IS YOUR KING TO SAVE YOU IN ALL YOUR CITIES

WHERE ARE ALL YOUR RULERSTHOSE OF WHOM YOU SAID GIVE ME A KING AND PRINCES

I GAVE YOU A KING IN MY ANGER AND I TOOK HIM AWAY IN MY WRATH

THE INIQUITY OF EPHRAIM IS BOUND UP; HIS SIN IS KEPT IN STORE

THE PANGS OF CHILDBIRTH COME FOR HIM BUT HE IS AN UNWISE SON FOR AT THE RIGHT TIME HE DOES NOT PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE OPENING OF THE WOMB

SHALL I RANSOM THEM FROM THE POWER OF SHEOL

SHALL I REDEEM THEM FROM DEATH

O DEATH WHERE ARE YOUR PLAGUES

O SHEOL WHERE IS YOUR STING

COMPASSION IS HIDDEN FROM MY EYES

THOUGH HE MAY FLOURISH AMONG HIS BROTHERS THE EAST WIND THE WIND OF THE LORD SHALL COME RISING FROM THE WILDERNESS AND HIS FOUNTAIN SHALL DRY UP; HIS SPRING SHALL BE PARCHED; IT SHALL STRIP HIS TREASURY OF EVERY PRECIOUS THING

SAMARIA SHALL BEAR HER GUILT BECAUSE SHE HAS REBELLED AGAINST HER GOD; THEY SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD; THEIR LITTLE ONES SHALL BE DASHED IN PIECES AND THEIR PREGNANT WOMEN RIPPED OPEN

RETURN O ISRAEL TO THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR YOU HAVE STUMBLED BECAUSE OF YOUR INIQUITY

TAKE WITH YOU WORDS AND RETURN TO THE LORD; SAY TO HIM TAKE AWAY ALL INIQUITY; ACCEPT WHAT IS GOOD AND WE WILL PAY WITH BULLS THE VOWS OF OUR LIPS

ASSYRIA SHALL NOT SAVE US; WE WILL NOT RIDE ON HORSES; AND WE WILL SAY NO MORE 'OUR GOD' TO THE WORK OF OUR HANDS

IN YOU THE ORPHAN FINDS MERCY

 I WILL HEAL THEIR APOSTASY; I WILL LOVE THEM FREELY FOR MY ANGER HAS TURNED FROM THEM

I WILL BE LIKE THE DEW TO ISRAEL; HE SHALL BLOSSOM LIKE THE LILY; HE SHALL TAKE ROOT LIKE THE TREES OF LEBANON; HIS SHOOTS SHALL SPREAD OUT; HIS BEAUTY SHALL BE LIKE THE OLIVE AND HIS FRAGRANCE LIKE LEBANON

THEY SHALL RETURN AND DWELL BENEATH MY SHADOW; THEY SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE GRAIN; THEY SHALL BLOSSOM LIKE THE VINE; THEIR FAME SHALL BE LIKE THE WINE OF LEBANON

O EPHRAIM WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH IDOLS

IT IS I WHO ANSWER AND LOOK AFTER YOU

I AM LIKE AN EVERGREEN CYPRESS; FROM ME COMES YOUR FRUIT

WHOEVER IS WISE LET HIM UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS; WHOEVER IS DISCERNING LET HIM KNOW THEM; FOR THE WAYS OF THE LORD ARE RIGHT AND THE UPRIGHT WALK IN THEM BUT TRANSGRESSORS STUMBLE IN THEM

ZECHARIAHIN THE EIGHTH MONTH IN THE SECOND YEAR OF DARIUS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO THE PROPHET ZECHARIAH THE SON OF BERECHIAH SON OF IDDO SAYING THE LORD WAS VERY ANGRY WITH YOUR FATHERS

THEREFORE SAY TO THEM THUS DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS RETURN TO ME SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AND I WILL RETURN TO YOU SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

DO NOT BE LIKE YOUR FATHERS TO WHOM THE FORMER PROPHETS CRIED OUT 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS RETURN FROM YOUR EVIL WAYS AND FROM YOUR EVIL DEEDS

' BUT THEY DID NOT HEAR OR PAY ATTENTION TO ME DECLARES THE LORD

YOUR FATHERS WHERE ARE THEY

AND THE PROPHETS DO THEY LIVE FOREVER

BUT MY WORDS AND MY STATUTES WHICH I COMMANDED MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS DID THEY NOT OVERTAKE YOUR FATHERS

SO THEY REPENTED AND SAID AS THE LORD OF HOSTS PURPOSED TO DEAL WITH US FOR OUR WAYS AND DEEDS SO HAS HE DEALT WITH US

 ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THE ELEVENTH MONTH WHICH IS THE MONTH OF SHEBAT IN THE SECOND YEAR OF DARIUS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO THE PROPHET ZECHARIAH THE SON OF BERECHIAH SON OF IDDO SAYING I SAW IN THE NIGHT AND BEHOLD A MAN RIDING ON A RED HORSE

HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE MYRTLE TREES IN THE GLEN AND BEHIND HIM WERE RED SORREL AND WHITE HORSES

THEN I SAID 'WHAT ARE THESE MY LORD

' THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME SAID TO ME 'I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT THEY ARE

' SO THE MAN WHO WAS STANDING AMONG THE MYRTLE TREES ANSWERED 'THESE ARE THEY WHOM THE LORD HAS SENT TO PATROL THE EARTH

' AND THEY ANSWERED THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WHO WAS STANDING AMONG THE MYRTLE TREES AND SAID 'WE HAVE PATROLLED THE EARTH AND BEHOLD ALL THE EARTH REMAINS AT REST

' THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID 'O LORD OF HOSTS HOW LONG WILL YOU HAVE NO MERCY ON JERUSALEM AND THE CITIES OF JUDAH AGAINST WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ANGRY THESE SEVENTY YEARS

' AND THE LORD ANSWERED GRACIOUS AND COMFORTING WORDS TO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME

SO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME SAID TO ME 'CRY OUT THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS I AM EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS FOR JERUSALEM AND FOR ZION

AND I AM EXCEEDINGLY ANGRY WITH THE NATIONS THAT ARE AT EASE; FOR WHILE I WAS ANGRY BUT A LITTLE THEY FURTHERED THE DISASTER

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD I HAVE RETURNED TO JERUSALEM WITH MERCY; MY HOUSE SHALL BE BUILT IN IT DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND THE MEASURING LINE SHALL BE STRETCHED OUT OVER JERUSALEM

CRY OUT AGAIN THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS MY CITIES SHALL AGAIN OVERFLOW WITH PROSPERITY AND THE LORD WILL AGAIN COMFORT ZION AND AGAIN CHOOSE JERUSALEM

' AND I LIFTED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD FOUR HORNS

AND I SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME WHAT ARE THESE

 AND HE SAID TO ME THESE ARE THE HORNS THAT HAVE SCATTERED JUDAH ISRAEL AND JERUSALEM

 THEN THE LORD SHOWED ME FOUR CRAFTSMEN

AND I SAID WHAT ARE THESE COMING TO DO

 HE SAID THESE ARE THE HORNS THAT SCATTERED JUDAH SO THAT NO ONE RAISED HIS HEAD

AND THESE HAVE COME TO TERRIFY THEM TO CAST DOWN THE HORNS OF THE NATIONS WHO LIFTED UP THEIR HORNS AGAINST THE LAND OF JUDAH TO SCATTER IT

AND I LIFTED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD A MAN WITH A MEASURING LINE IN HIS HAND

THEN I SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING

 AND HE SAID TO ME TO MEASURE JERUSALEM TO SEE WHAT IS ITS WIDTH AND WHAT IS ITS LENGTH

 AND BEHOLD THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME CAME FORWARD AND ANOTHER ANGEL CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM AND SAID TO HIM RUN SAY TO THAT YOUNG MAN 'JERUSALEM SHALL BE INHABITED AS VILLAGES WITHOUT WALLS BECAUSE OF THE MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE AND LIVESTOCK IN IT

AND I WILL BE TO HER A WALL OF FIRE ALL AROUND DECLARES THE LORD AND I WILL BE THE GLORY IN HER MIDST

' UP

UP

FLEE FROM THE LAND OF THE NORTH DECLARES THE LORD

FOR I HAVE SPREAD YOU ABROAD AS THE FOUR WINDS OF THE HEAVENS DECLARES THE LORD

UP

ESCAPE TO ZION YOU WHO DWELL WITH THE DAUGHTER OF BABYLON

FOR THUS SAID THE LORD OF HOSTS AFTER HIS GLORY SENT ME TO THE NATIONS WHO PLUNDERED YOU FOR HE WHO TOUCHES YOU TOUCHES THE APPLE OF HIS EYE BEHOLD I WILL SHAKE MY HAND OVER THEM AND THEY SHALL BECOME PLUNDER FOR THOSE WHO SERVED THEM

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SENT ME

SING AND REJOICE O DAUGHTER OF ZION FOR BEHOLD I COME AND I WILL DWELL IN YOUR MIDST DECLARES THE LORD

AND MANY NATIONS SHALL JOIN THEMSELVES TO THE LORD IN THAT DAY AND SHALL BE MY PEOPLE

AND I WILL DWELL IN YOUR MIDST AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SENT ME TO YOU

AND THE LORD WILL INHERIT JUDAH AS HIS PORTION IN THE HOLY LAND AND WILL AGAIN CHOOSE JERUSALEM

 BE SILENT ALL FLESH BEFORE THE LORD FOR HE HAS ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS HOLY DWELLING

THEN HE SHOWED ME JOSHUA THE HIGH PRIEST STANDING BEFORE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD AND SATAN STANDING AT HIS RIGHT HAND TO ACCUSE HIM

AND THE LORD SAID TO SATAN THE LORD REBUKE YOU O SATAN

THE LORD WHO HAS CHOSEN JERUSALEM REBUKE YOU

IS NOT THIS A BRAND PLUCKED FROM THE FIRE

 NOW JOSHUA WAS STANDING BEFORE THE ANGEL CLOTHED WITH FILTHY GARMENTS

AND THE ANGEL SAID TO THOSE WHO WERE STANDING BEFORE HIM REMOVE THE FILTHY GARMENTS FROM HIM

 AND TO HIM HE SAID BEHOLD I HAVE TAKEN YOUR INIQUITY AWAY FROM YOU AND I WILL CLOTHE YOU WITH PURE VESTMENTS

 AND I SAID LET THEM PUT A CLEAN TURBAN ON HIS HEAD

 SO THEY PUT A CLEAN TURBAN ON HIS HEAD AND CLOTHED HIM WITH GARMENTS

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WAS STANDING BY

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SOLEMNLY ASSURED JOSHUA THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IF YOU WILL WALK IN MY WAYS AND KEEP MY CHARGE THEN YOU SHALL RULE MY HOUSE AND HAVE CHARGE OF MY COURTS AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT OF ACCESS AMONG THOSE WHO ARE STANDING HERE

HEAR NOW O JOSHUA THE HIGH PRIEST YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WHO SIT BEFORE YOU FOR THEY ARE MEN WHO ARE A SIGN BEHOLD I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE BRANCH

FOR BEHOLD ON THE STONE THAT I HAVE SET BEFORE JOSHUA ON A SINGLE STONE WITH SEVEN EYES I WILL ENGRAVE ITS INSCRIPTION DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND I WILL REMOVE THE INIQUITY OF THIS LAND IN A SINGLE DAY

IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL INVITE HIS NEIGHBOR TO COME UNDER HIS VINE AND UNDER HIS FIG TREE

AND THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME CAME AGAIN AND WOKE ME LIKE A MAN WHO IS AWAKENED OUT OF HIS SLEEP

AND HE SAID TO ME WHAT DO YOU SEE

 I SAID I SEE AND BEHOLD A LAMPSTAND ALL OF GOLD WITH A BOWL ON THE TOP OF IT AND SEVEN LAMPS ON IT WITH SEVEN LIPS ON EACH OF THE LAMPS THAT ARE ON THE TOP OF IT

AND THERE ARE TWO OLIVE TREES BY IT ONE ON THE RIGHT OF THE BOWL AND THE OTHER ON ITS LEFT

 AND I SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME WHAT ARE THESE MY LORD

 THEN THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME ANSWERED AND SAID TO ME DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THESE ARE

 I SAID NO MY LORD

 THEN HE SAID TO ME THIS IS THE WORD OF THE LORD TO ZERUBBABEL NOT BY MIGHT NOR BY POWER BUT BY MY SPIRIT SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS

WHO ARE YOU O GREAT MOUNTAIN

BEFORE ZERUBBABEL YOU SHALL BECOME A PLAIN

AND HE SHALL BRING FORWARD THE TOP STONE AMID SHOUTS OF 'GRACE GRACE TO IT

' THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING THE HANDS OF ZERUBBABEL HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THIS HOUSE; HIS HANDS SHALL ALSO COMPLETE IT

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SENT ME TO YOU

FOR WHOEVER HAS DESPISED THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS SHALL REJOICE AND SHALL SEE THE PLUMB LINE IN THE HAND OF ZERUBBABEL

THESE SEVEN ARE THE EYES OF THE LORD WHICH RANGE THROUGH THE WHOLE EARTH

 THEN I SAID TO HIM WHAT ARE THESE TWO OLIVE TREES ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT OF THE LAMPSTAND

 AND A SECOND TIME I ANSWERED AND SAID TO HIM WHAT ARE THESE TWO BRANCHES OF THE OLIVE TREES WHICH ARE BESIDE THE TWO GOLDEN PIPES FROM WHICH THE GOLDEN OIL IS POURED OUT

 HE SAID TO ME DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THESE ARE

 I SAID NO MY LORD

 THEN HE SAID THESE ARE THE TWO ANOINTED ONES WHO STAND BY THE LORD OF THE WHOLE EARTH

AGAIN I LIFTED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD A FLYING SCROLL

AND HE SAID TO ME WHAT DO YOU SEE

 I ANSWERED I SEE A FLYING SCROLL

ITS LENGTH IS TWENTY CUBITS AND ITS WIDTH TEN CUBITS

 THEN HE SAID TO ME THIS IS THE CURSE THAT GOES OUT OVER THE FACE OF THE WHOLE LAND

FOR EVERYONE WHO STEALS SHALL BE CLEANED OUT ACCORDING TO WHAT IS ON ONE SIDE AND EVERYONE WHO SWEARS FALSELY SHALL BE CLEANED OUT ACCORDING TO WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE

I WILL SEND IT OUT DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS AND IT SHALL ENTER THE HOUSE OF THE THIEF AND THE HOUSE OF HIM WHO SWEARS FALSELY BY MY NAME

AND IT SHALL REMAIN IN HIS HOUSE AND CONSUME IT BOTH TIMBER AND STONES

 THEN THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME LIFT YOUR EYES AND SEE WHAT THIS IS THAT IS GOING OUT

 AND I SAID WHAT IS IT

 HE SAID THIS IS THE BASKET THAT IS GOING OUT

 AND HE SAID THIS IS THEIR INIQUITY IN ALL THE LAND

 AND BEHOLD THE LEADEN COVER WAS LIFTED AND THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING IN THE BASKET

AND HE SAID THIS IS WICKEDNESS

 AND HE THRUST HER BACK INTO THE BASKET AND THRUST DOWN THE LEADEN WEIGHT ON ITS OPENING

THEN I LIFTED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD TWO WOMEN COMING FORWARD

THE WIND WAS IN THEIR WINGS

THEY HAD WINGS LIKE THE WINGS OF A STORK AND THEY LIFTED UP THE BASKET BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN

THEN I SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME WHERE ARE THEY TAKING THE BASKET

 HE SAID TO ME TO THE LAND OF SHINAR TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR IT

AND WHEN THIS IS PREPARED THEY WILL SET THE BASKET DOWN THERE ON ITS BASE

AGAIN I LIFTED MY EYES AND SAW AND BEHOLD FOUR CHARIOTS CAME OUT FROM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS

AND THE MOUNTAINS WERE MOUNTAINS OF BRONZE

THE FIRST CHARIOT HAD RED HORSES THE SECOND BLACK HORSES THE THIRD WHITE HORSES AND THE FOURTH CHARIOT DAPPLED HORSESALL OF THEM STRONG

THEN I ANSWERED AND SAID TO THE ANGEL WHO TALKED WITH ME WHAT ARE THESE MY LORD

 AND THE ANGEL ANSWERED AND SAID TO ME THESE ARE GOING OUT TO THE FOUR WINDS OF HEAVEN AFTER PRESENTING THEMSELVES BEFORE THE LORD OF ALL THE EARTH

THE CHARIOT WITH THE BLACK HORSES GOES TOWARD THE NORTH COUNTRY THE WHITE ONES GO AFTER THEM AND THE DAPPLED ONES GO TOWARD THE SOUTH COUNTRY

 WHEN THE STRONG HORSES CAME OUT THEY WERE IMPATIENT TO GO AND PATROL THE EARTH

AND HE SAID GO PATROL THE EARTH

 SO THEY PATROLLED THE EARTH

THEN HE CRIED TO ME BEHOLD THOSE WHO GO TOWARD THE NORTH COUNTRY HAVE SET MY SPIRIT AT REST IN THE NORTH COUNTRY

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME TAKE FROM THE EXILES HELDAI TOBIJAH AND JEDAIAH WHO HAVE ARRIVED FROM BABYLON AND GO THE SAME DAY TO THE HOUSE OF JOSIAH THE SON OF ZEPHANIAH

TAKE FROM THEM SILVER AND GOLD AND MAKE A CROWN AND SET IT ON THE HEAD OF JOSHUA THE SON OF JEHOZADAK THE HIGH PRIEST

AND SAY TO HIM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS THE BRANCH FOR HE SHALL BRANCH OUT FROM HIS PLACE AND HE SHALL BUILD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

IT IS HE WHO SHALL BUILD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AND SHALL BEAR ROYAL HONOR AND SHALL SIT AND RULE ON HIS THRONE

AND THERE SHALL BE A PRIEST ON HIS THRONE AND THE COUNSEL OF PEACE SHALL BE BETWEEN THEM BOTH

' AND THE CROWN SHALL BE IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AS A REMINDER TO HELEM TOBIJAH JEDAIAH AND HEN THE SON OF ZEPHANIAH

AND THOSE WHO ARE FAR OFF SHALL COME AND HELP TO BUILD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAS SENT ME TO YOU

AND THIS SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU WILL DILIGENTLY OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF KING DARIUS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ZECHARIAH ON THE FOURTH DAY OF THE NINTH MONTH WHICH IS CHISLEV

NOW THE PEOPLE OF BETHEL HAD SENT SHAREZER AND REGEMMELECH AND THEIR MEN TO ENTREAT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD SAYING TO THE PRIESTS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS AND THE PROPHETS SHOULD I WEEP AND ABSTAIN IN THE FIFTH MONTH AS I HAVE DONE FOR SO MANY YEARS

 THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS CAME TO ME SAY TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND THE PRIESTS WHEN YOU FASTED AND MOURNED IN THE FIFTH MONTH AND IN THE SEVENTH FOR THESE SEVENTY YEARS WAS IT FOR ME THAT YOU FASTED

AND WHEN YOU EAT AND WHEN YOU DRINK DO YOU NOT EAT FOR YOURSELVES AND DRINK FOR YOURSELVES

WERE NOT THESE THE WORDS THAT THE LORD PROCLAIMED BY THE FORMER PROPHETS WHEN JERUSALEM WAS INHABITED AND PROSPEROUS WITH HER CITIES AROUND HER AND THE SOUTH AND THE LOWLAND WERE INHABITED

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ZECHARIAH SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS RENDER TRUE JUDGMENTS SHOW KINDNESS AND MERCY TO ONE ANOTHER DO NOT OPPRESS THE WIDOW THE FATHERLESS THE SOJOURNER OR THE POOR AND LET NONE OF YOU DEVISE EVIL AGAINST ANOTHER IN YOUR HEART

 BUT THEY REFUSED TO PAY ATTENTION AND TURNED A STUBBORN SHOULDER AND STOPPED THEIR EARS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HEAR

THEY MADE THEIR HEARTS DIAMONDHARD LEST THEY SHOULD HEAR THE LAW AND THE WORDS THAT THE LORD OF HOSTS HAD SENT BY HIS SPIRIT THROUGH THE FORMER PROPHETS

THEREFORE GREAT ANGER CAME FROM THE LORD OF HOSTS

AS I CALLED AND THEY WOULD NOT HEAR SO THEY CALLED AND I WOULD NOT HEAR SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AND I SCATTERED THEM WITH A WHIRLWIND AMONG ALL THE NATIONS THAT THEY HAD NOT KNOWN

THUS THE LAND THEY LEFT WAS DESOLATE SO THAT NO ONE WENT TO AND FRO AND THE PLEASANT LAND WAS MADE DESOLATE

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS CAME SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS I AM JEALOUS FOR ZION WITH GREAT JEALOUSY AND I AM JEALOUS FOR HER WITH GREAT WRATH

THUS SAYS THE LORD I HAVE RETURNED TO ZION AND WILL DWELL IN THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM AND JERUSALEM SHALL BE CALLED THE FAITHFUL CITY AND THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE HOLY MOUNTAIN

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS OLD MEN AND OLD WOMEN SHALL AGAIN SIT IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM EACH WITH STAFF IN HAND BECAUSE OF GREAT AGE

AND THE STREETS OF THE CITY SHALL BE FULL OF BOYS AND GIRLS PLAYING IN ITS STREETS

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IF IT IS MARVELOUS IN THE SIGHT OF THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE IN THOSE DAYS SHOULD IT ALSO BE MARVELOUS IN MY SIGHT DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS BEHOLD I WILL SAVE MY PEOPLE FROM THE EAST COUNTRY AND FROM THE WEST COUNTRY AND I WILL BRING THEM TO DWELL IN THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM

AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD IN FAITHFULNESS AND IN RIGHTEOUSNESS

 THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS LET YOUR HANDS BE STRONG YOU WHO IN THESE DAYS HAVE BEEN HEARING THESE WORDS FROM THE MOUTH OF THE PROPHETS WHO WERE PRESENT ON THE DAY THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WAS LAID THAT THE TEMPLE MIGHT BE BUILT

FOR BEFORE THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO WAGE FOR MAN OR ANY WAGE FOR BEAST NEITHER WAS THERE ANY SAFETY FROM THE FOE FOR HIM WHO WENT OUT OR CAME IN FOR I SET EVERY MAN AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR

BUT NOW I WILL NOT DEAL WITH THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE AS IN THE FORMER DAYS DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

FOR THERE SHALL BE A SOWING OF PEACE

THE VINE SHALL GIVE ITS FRUIT AND THE GROUND SHALL GIVE ITS PRODUCE AND THE HEAVENS SHALL GIVE THEIR DEW

AND I WILL CAUSE THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE TO POSSESS ALL THESE THINGS

AND AS YOU HAVE BEEN A BYWORD OF CURSING AMONG THE NATIONS O HOUSE OF JUDAH AND HOUSE OF ISRAEL SO WILL I SAVE YOU AND YOU SHALL BE A BLESSING

FEAR NOT BUT LET YOUR HANDS BE STRONG

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AS I PURPOSED TO BRING DISASTER TO YOU WHEN YOUR FATHERS PROVOKED ME TO WRATH AND I DID NOT RELENT SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS SO AGAIN HAVE I PURPOSED IN THESE DAYS TO BRING GOOD TO JERUSALEM AND TO THE HOUSE OF JUDAH; FEAR NOT

THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU SHALL DO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO ONE ANOTHER; RENDER IN YOUR GATES JUDGMENTS THAT ARE TRUE AND MAKE FOR PEACE; DO NOT DEVISE EVIL IN YOUR HEARTS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND LOVE NO FALSE OATH FOR ALL THESE THINGS I HATE DECLARES THE LORD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS CAME TO ME SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS THE FAST OF THE FOURTH MONTH AND THE FAST OF THE FIFTH AND THE FAST OF THE SEVENTH AND THE FAST OF THE TENTH SHALL BE TO THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SEASONS OF JOY AND GLADNESS AND CHEERFUL FEASTS

THEREFORE LOVE TRUTH AND PEACE

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS PEOPLES SHALL YET COME EVEN THE INHABITANTS OF MANY CITIES

THE INHABITANTS OF ONE CITY SHALL GO TO ANOTHER SAYING 'LET US GO AT ONCE TO ENTREAT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD AND TO SEEK THE LORD OF HOSTS; I MYSELF AM GOING

' MANY PEOPLES AND STRONG NATIONS SHALL COME TO SEEK THE LORD OF HOSTS IN JERUSALEM AND TO ENTREAT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS IN THOSE DAYS TEN MEN FROM THE NATIONS OF EVERY TONGUE SHALL TAKE HOLD OF THE ROBE OF A JEW SAYING 'LET US GO WITH YOU FOR WE HAVE HEARD THAT GOD IS WITH YOU

'THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THE LAND OF HADRACH AND DAMASCUS IS ITS RESTING PLACE

FOR THE LORD HAS AN EYE ON MANKIND AND ON ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL AND ON HAMATH ALSO WHICH BORDERS ON IT TYRE AND SIDON THOUGH THEY ARE VERY WISE

TYRE HAS BUILT HERSELF A RAMPART AND HEAPED UP SILVER LIKE DUST AND FINE GOLD LIKE THE MUD OF THE STREETS

BUT BEHOLD THE LORD WILL STRIP HER OF HER POSSESSIONS AND STRIKE DOWN HER POWER ON THE SEA AND SHE SHALL BE DEVOURED BY FIRE

ASHKELON SHALL SEE IT AND BE AFRAID; GAZA TOO AND SHALL WRITHE IN ANGUISH; EKRON ALSO BECAUSE ITS HOPES ARE CONFOUNDED

THE KING SHALL PERISH FROM GAZA; ASHKELON SHALL BE UNINHABITED; A MIXED PEOPLE SHALL DWELL IN ASHDOD AND I WILL CUT OFF THE PRIDE OF PHILISTIA

I WILL TAKE AWAY ITS BLOOD FROM ITS MOUTH AND ITS ABOMINATIONS FROM BETWEEN ITS TEETH; IT TOO SHALL BE A REMNANT FOR OUR GOD; IT SHALL BE LIKE A CLAN IN JUDAH AND EKRON SHALL BE LIKE THE JEBUSITES

THEN I WILL ENCAMP AT MY HOUSE AS A GUARD SO THAT NONE SHALL MARCH TO AND FRO; NO OPPRESSOR SHALL AGAIN MARCH OVER THEM FOR NOW I SEE WITH MY OWN EYES

REJOICE GREATLY O DAUGHTER OF ZION

SHOUT ALOUD O DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU; RIGHTEOUS AND HAVING SALVATION IS HE HUMBLE AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY ON A COLT THE FOAL OF A DONKEY

I WILL CUT OFF THE CHARIOT FROM EPHRAIM AND THE WAR HORSE FROM JERUSALEM; AND THE BATTLE BOW SHALL BE CUT OFF AND HE SHALL SPEAK PEACE TO THE NATIONS; HIS RULE SHALL BE FROM SEA TO SEA AND FROM THE RIVER TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

AS FOR YOU ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD OF MY COVENANT WITH YOU I WILL SET YOUR PRISONERS FREE FROM THE WATERLESS PIT

RETURN TO YOUR STRONGHOLD O PRISONERS OF HOPE; TODAY I DECLARE THAT I WILL RESTORE TO YOU DOUBLE

FOR I HAVE BENT JUDAH AS MY BOW; I HAVE MADE EPHRAIM ITS ARROW

I WILL STIR UP YOUR SONS O ZION AGAINST YOUR SONS O GREECE AND WIELD YOU LIKE A WARRIOR'S SWORD

THEN THE LORD WILL APPEAR OVER THEM AND HIS ARROW WILL GO FORTH LIKE LIGHTNING; THE LORD GOD WILL SOUND THE TRUMPET AND WILL MARCH FORTH IN THE WHIRLWINDS OF THE SOUTH

THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PROTECT THEM AND THEY SHALL DEVOUR AND TREAD DOWN THE SLING STONES AND THEY SHALL DRINK AND ROAR AS IF DRUNK WITH WINE AND BE FULL LIKE A BOWL DRENCHED LIKE THE CORNERS OF THE ALTAR

ON THAT DAY THE LORD THEIR GOD WILL SAVE THEM AS THE FLOCK OF HIS PEOPLE; FOR LIKE THE JEWELS OF A CROWN THEY SHALL SHINE ON HIS LAND

FOR HOW GREAT IS HIS GOODNESS AND HOW GREAT HIS BEAUTY

GRAIN SHALL MAKE THE YOUNG MEN FLOURISH AND NEW WINE THE YOUNG WOMEN

ASK RAIN FROM THE LORD IN THE SEASON OF THE SPRING RAIN FROM THE LORD WHO MAKES THE STORM CLOUDS AND HE WILL GIVE THEM SHOWERS OF RAIN TO EVERYONE THE VEGETATION IN THE FIELD

FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS UTTER NONSENSE AND THE DIVINERS SEE LIES; THEY TELL FALSE DREAMS AND GIVE EMPTY CONSOLATION

THEREFORE THE PEOPLE WANDER LIKE SHEEP; THEY ARE AFFLICTED FOR LACK OF A SHEPHERD

MY ANGER IS HOT AGAINST THE SHEPHERDS AND I WILL PUNISH THE LEADERS; FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS CARES FOR HIS FLOCK THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND WILL MAKE THEM LIKE HIS MAJESTIC STEED IN BATTLE

FROM HIM SHALL COME THE CORNERSTONE FROM HIM THE TENT PEG FROM HIM THE BATTLE BOW FROM HIM EVERY RULERALL OF THEM TOGETHER

THEY SHALL BE LIKE MIGHTY MEN IN BATTLE TRAMPLING THE FOE IN THE MUD OF THE STREETS; THEY SHALL FIGHT BECAUSE THE LORD IS WITH THEM AND THEY SHALL PUT TO SHAME THE RIDERS ON HORSES

I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH AND I WILL SAVE THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH

I WILL BRING THEM BACK BECAUSE I HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM AND THEY SHALL BE AS THOUGH I HAD NOT REJECTED THEM FOR I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD AND I WILL ANSWER THEM

THEN EPHRAIM SHALL BECOME LIKE A MIGHTY WARRIOR AND THEIR HEARTS SHALL BE GLAD AS WITH WINE

THEIR CHILDREN SHALL SEE IT AND BE GLAD; THEIR HEARTS SHALL REJOICE IN THE LORD

I WILL WHISTLE FOR THEM AND GATHER THEM IN FOR I HAVE REDEEMED THEM AND THEY SHALL BE AS MANY AS THEY WERE BEFORE

THOUGH I SCATTERED THEM AMONG THE NATIONS YET IN FAR COUNTRIES THEY SHALL REMEMBER ME AND WITH THEIR CHILDREN THEY SHALL LIVE AND RETURN

I WILL BRING THEM HOME FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT AND GATHER THEM FROM ASSYRIA AND I WILL BRING THEM TO THE LAND OF GILEAD AND TO LEBANON TILL THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM

HE SHALL PASS THROUGH THE SEA OF TROUBLES AND STRIKE DOWN THE WAVES OF THE SEA AND ALL THE DEPTHS OF THE NILE SHALL BE DRIED UP

THE PRIDE OF ASSYRIA SHALL BE LAID LOW AND THE SCEPTER OF EGYPT SHALL DEPART

I WILL MAKE THEM STRONG IN THE LORD AND THEY SHALL WALK IN HIS NAME DECLARES THE LORD

OPEN YOUR DOORS O LEBANON THAT THE FIRE MAY DEVOUR YOUR CEDARS

WAIL O CYPRESS FOR THE CEDAR HAS FALLEN FOR THE GLORIOUS TREES ARE RUINED

WAIL OAKS OF BASHAN FOR THE THICK FOREST HAS BEEN FELLED

THE SOUND OF THE WAIL OF THE SHEPHERDS FOR THEIR GLORY IS RUINED

THE SOUND OF THE ROAR OF THE LIONS FOR THE THICKET OF THE JORDAN IS RUINED

THUS SAID THE LORD MY GOD BECOME SHEPHERD OF THE FLOCK DOOMED TO SLAUGHTER

THOSE WHO BUY THEM SLAUGHTER THEM AND GO UNPUNISHED AND THOSE WHO SELL THEM SAY 'BLESSED BE THE LORD I HAVE BECOME RICH' AND THEIR OWN SHEPHERDS HAVE NO PITY ON THEM

FOR I WILL NO LONGER HAVE PITY ON THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND DECLARES THE LORD

BEHOLD I WILL CAUSE EACH OF THEM TO FALL INTO THE HAND OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND EACH INTO THE HAND OF HIS KING AND THEY SHALL CRUSH THE LAND AND I WILL DELIVER NONE FROM THEIR HAND

 SO I BECAME THE SHEPHERD OF THE FLOCK DOOMED TO BE SLAUGHTERED BY THE SHEEP TRADERS

AND I TOOK TWO STAFFS ONE I NAMED FAVOR THE OTHER I NAMED UNION

AND I TENDED THE SHEEP

IN ONE MONTH I DESTROYED THE THREE SHEPHERDS

BUT I BECAME IMPATIENT WITH THEM AND THEY ALSO DETESTED ME

SO I SAID I WILL NOT BE YOUR SHEPHERD

WHAT IS TO DIE LET IT DIE

WHAT IS TO BE DESTROYED LET IT BE DESTROYED

AND LET THOSE WHO ARE LEFT DEVOUR THE FLESH OF ONE ANOTHER

 AND I TOOK MY STAFF FAVOR AND I BROKE IT ANNULLING THE COVENANT THAT I HAD MADE WITH ALL THE PEOPLES

SO IT WAS ANNULLED ON THAT DAY AND THE SHEEP TRADERS WHO WERE WATCHING ME KNEW THAT IT WAS THE WORD OF THE LORD

THEN I SAID TO THEM IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU GIVE ME MY WAGES; BUT IF NOT KEEP THEM

 AND THEY WEIGHED OUT AS MY WAGES THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME THROW IT TO THE POTTERTHE LORDLY PRICE AT WHICH I WAS PRICED BY THEM

SO I TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER AND THREW THEM INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO THE POTTER

THEN I BROKE MY SECOND STAFF UNION ANNULLING THE BROTHERHOOD BETWEEN JUDAH AND ISRAEL

THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME TAKE ONCE MORE THE EQUIPMENT OF A FOOLISH SHEPHERD

FOR BEHOLD I AM RAISING UP IN THE LAND A SHEPHERD WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR THOSE BEING DESTROYED OR SEEK THE YOUNG OR HEAL THE MAIMED OR NOURISH THE HEALTHY BUT DEVOURS THE FLESH OF THE FAT ONES TEARING OFF EVEN THEIR HOOFS

WOE TO MY WORTHLESS SHEPHERD WHO DESERTS THE FLOCK

MAY THE SWORD STRIKE HIS ARM AND HIS RIGHT EYE

LET HIS ARM BE WHOLLY WITHERED HIS RIGHT EYE UTTERLY BLINDED

THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD CONCERNING ISRAEL THUS DECLARES THE LORD WHO STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS AND FOUNDED THE EARTH AND FORMED THE SPIRIT OF MAN WITHIN HIM BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO MAKE JERUSALEM A CUP OF STAGGERING TO ALL THE SURROUNDING PEOPLES

THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM WILL ALSO BE AGAINST JUDAH

ON THAT DAY I WILL MAKE JERUSALEM A HEAVY STONE FOR ALL THE PEOPLES

ALL WHO LIFT IT WILL SURELY HURT THEMSELVES

AND ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH WILL GATHER AGAINST IT

ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD I WILL STRIKE EVERY HORSE WITH PANIC AND ITS RIDER WITH MADNESS

BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH I WILL KEEP MY EYES OPEN WHEN I STRIKE EVERY HORSE OF THE PEOPLES WITH BLINDNESS

THEN THE CLANS OF JUDAH SHALL SAY TO THEMSELVES 'THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM HAVE STRENGTH THROUGH THE LORD OF HOSTS THEIR GOD

' ON THAT DAY I WILL MAKE THE CLANS OF JUDAH LIKE A BLAZING POT IN THE MIDST OF WOOD LIKE A FLAMING TORCH AMONG SHEAVES

AND THEY SHALL DEVOUR TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT ALL THE SURROUNDING PEOPLES WHILE JERUSALEM SHALL AGAIN BE INHABITED IN ITS PLACE IN JERUSALEM

AND THE LORD WILL GIVE SALVATION TO THE TENTS OF JUDAH FIRST THAT THE GLORY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND THE GLORY OF THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM MAY NOT SURPASS THAT OF JUDAH

ON THAT DAY THE LORD WILL PROTECT THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SO THAT THE FEEBLEST AMONG THEM ON THAT DAY SHALL BE LIKE DAVID AND THE HOUSE OF DAVID SHALL BE LIKE GOD LIKE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD GOING BEFORE THEM

AND ON THAT DAY I WILL SEEK TO DESTROY ALL THE NATIONS THAT COME AGAINST JERUSALEM

AND I WILL POUR OUT ON THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM A SPIRIT OF GRACE AND PLEAS FOR MERCY SO THAT WHEN THEY LOOK ON ME ON HIM WHOM THEY HAVE PIERCED THEY SHALL MOURN FOR HIM AS ONE MOURNS FOR AN ONLY CHILD AND WEEP BITTERLY OVER HIM AS ONE WEEPS OVER A FIRSTBORN

ON THAT DAY THE MOURNING IN JERUSALEM WILL BE AS GREAT AS THE MOURNING FOR HADADRIMMON IN THE PLAIN OF MEGIDDO

THE LAND SHALL MOURN EACH FAMILY BY ITSELF THE FAMILY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID BY ITSELF AND THEIR WIVES BY THEMSELVES; THE FAMILY OF THE HOUSE OF NATHAN BY ITSELF AND THEIR WIVES BY THEMSELVES; THE FAMILY OF THE HOUSE OF LEVI BY ITSELF AND THEIR WIVES BY THEMSELVES; THE FAMILY OF THE SHIMEITES BY ITSELF AND THEIR WIVES BY THEMSELVES; AND ALL THE FAMILIES THAT ARE LEFT EACH BY ITSELF AND THEIR WIVES BY THEMSELVES

ON THAT DAY THERE SHALL BE A FOUNTAIN OPENED FOR THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM TO CLEANSE THEM FROM SIN AND UNCLEANNESS

AND ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS I WILL CUT OFF THE NAMES OF THE IDOLS FROM THE LAND SO THAT THEY SHALL BE REMEMBERED NO MORE

AND ALSO I WILL REMOVE FROM THE LAND THE PROPHETS AND THE SPIRIT OF UNCLEANNESS

AND IF ANYONE AGAIN PROPHESIES HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHO BORE HIM WILL SAY TO HIM 'YOU SHALL NOT LIVE FOR YOU SPEAK LIES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

' AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHO BORE HIM SHALL PIERCE HIM THROUGH WHEN HE PROPHESIES

ON THAT DAY EVERY PROPHET WILL BE ASHAMED OF HIS VISION WHEN HE PROPHESIES

HE WILL NOT PUT ON A HAIRY CLOAK IN ORDER TO DECEIVE BUT HE WILL SAY 'I AM NO PROPHET I AM A WORKER OF THE SOIL FOR A MAN SOLD ME IN MY YOUTH

' AND IF ONE ASKS HIM 'WHAT ARE THESE WOUNDS ON YOUR BACK

' HE WILL SAY 'THE WOUNDS I RECEIVED IN THE HOUSE OF MY FRIENDS

' AWAKE O SWORD AGAINST MY SHEPHERD AGAINST THE MAN WHO STANDS NEXT TO ME DECLARES THE LORD OF HOSTS

STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL BE SCATTERED; I WILL TURN MY HAND AGAINST THE LITTLE ONES

IN THE WHOLE LAND DECLARES THE LORD TWO THIRDS SHALL BE CUT OFF AND PERISH AND ONE THIRD SHALL BE LEFT ALIVE

AND I WILL PUT THIS THIRD INTO THE FIRE AND REFINE THEM AS ONE REFINES SILVER AND TEST THEM AS GOLD IS TESTED

THEY WILL CALL UPON MY NAME AND I WILL ANSWER THEM

I WILL SAY 'THEY ARE MY PEOPLE'; AND THEY WILL SAY 'THE LORD IS MY GOD

'BEHOLD A DAY IS COMING FOR THE LORD WHEN THE SPOIL TAKEN FROM YOU WILL BE DIVIDED IN YOUR MIDST

FOR I WILL GATHER ALL THE NATIONS AGAINST JERUSALEM TO BATTLE AND THE CITY SHALL BE TAKEN AND THE HOUSES PLUNDERED AND THE WOMEN RAPED

HALF OF THE CITY SHALL GO OUT INTO EXILE BUT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE SHALL NOT BE CUT OFF FROM THE CITY

THEN THE LORD WILL GO OUT AND FIGHT AGAINST THOSE NATIONS AS WHEN HE FIGHTS ON A DAY OF BATTLE

ON THAT DAY HIS FEET SHALL STAND ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES THAT LIES BEFORE JERUSALEM ON THE EAST AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES SHALL BE SPLIT IN TWO FROM EAST TO WEST BY A VERY WIDE VALLEY SO THAT ONE HALF OF THE MOUNT SHALL MOVE NORTHWARD AND THE OTHER HALF SOUTHWARD

AND YOU SHALL FLEE TO THE VALLEY OF MY MOUNTAINS FOR THE VALLEY OF THE MOUNTAINS SHALL REACH TO AZAL

AND YOU SHALL FLEE AS YOU FLED FROM THE EARTHQUAKE IN THE DAYS OF UZZIAH KING OF JUDAH

THEN THE LORD MY GOD WILL COME AND ALL THE HOLY ONES WITH HIM

ON THAT DAY THERE SHALL BE NO LIGHT COLD OR FROST

AND THERE SHALL BE A UNIQUE DAY WHICH IS KNOWN TO THE LORD NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT BUT AT EVENING TIME THERE SHALL BE LIGHT

ON THAT DAY LIVING WATERS SHALL FLOW OUT FROM JERUSALEM HALF OF THEM TO THE EASTERN SEA AND HALF OF THEM TO THE WESTERN SEA

IT SHALL CONTINUE IN SUMMER AS IN WINTER

AND THE LORD WILL BE KING OVER ALL THE EARTH

ON THAT DAY THE LORD WILL BE ONE AND HIS NAME ONE

THE WHOLE LAND SHALL BE TURNED INTO A PLAIN FROM GEBA TO RIMMON SOUTH OF JERUSALEM

BUT JERUSALEM SHALL REMAIN ALOFT ON ITS SITE FROM THE GATE OF BENJAMIN TO THE PLACE OF THE FORMER GATE TO THE CORNER GATE AND FROM THE TOWER OF HANANEL TO THE KING'S WINEPRESSES

AND IT SHALL BE INHABITED FOR THERE SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE A DECREE OF UTTER DESTRUCTION

JERUSALEM SHALL DWELL IN SECURITY

AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE WITH WHICH THE LORD WILL STRIKE ALL THE PEOPLES THAT WAGE WAR AGAINST JERUSALEM THEIR FLESH WILL ROT WHILE THEY ARE STILL STANDING ON THEIR FEET THEIR EYES WILL ROT IN THEIR SOCKETS AND THEIR TONGUES WILL ROT IN THEIR MOUTHS

AND ON THAT DAY A GREAT PANIC FROM THE LORD SHALL FALL ON THEM SO THAT EACH WILL SEIZE THE HAND OF ANOTHER AND THE HAND OF THE ONE WILL BE RAISED AGAINST THE HAND OF THE OTHER

EVEN JUDAH WILL FIGHT AGAINST JERUSALEM

AND THE WEALTH OF ALL THE SURROUNDING NATIONS SHALL BE COLLECTED GOLD SILVER AND GARMENTS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE

AND A PLAGUE LIKE THIS PLAGUE SHALL FALL ON THE HORSES THE MULES THE CAMELS THE DONKEYS AND WHATEVER BEASTS MAY BE IN THOSE CAMPS

THEN EVERYONE WHO SURVIVES OF ALL THE NATIONS THAT HAVE COME AGAINST JERUSALEM SHALL GO UP YEAR AFTER YEAR TO WORSHIP THE KING THE LORD OF HOSTS AND TO KEEP THE FEAST OF BOOTHS

AND IF ANY OF THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH DO NOT GO UP TO JERUSALEM TO WORSHIP THE KING THE LORD OF HOSTS THERE WILL BE NO RAIN ON THEM

AND IF THE FAMILY OF EGYPT DOES NOT GO UP AND PRESENT THEMSELVES THEN ON THEM THERE SHALL BE NO RAIN; THERE SHALL BE THE PLAGUE WITH WHICH THE LORD AFFLICTS THE NATIONS THAT DO NOT GO UP TO KEEP THE FEAST OF BOOTHS

THIS SHALL BE THE PUNISHMENT TO EGYPT AND THE PUNISHMENT TO ALL THE NATIONS THAT DO NOT GO UP TO KEEP THE FEAST OF BOOTHS

AND ON THAT DAY THERE SHALL BE INSCRIBED ON THE BELLS OF THE HORSES HOLY TO THE LORD

 AND THE POTS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE AS THE BOWLS BEFORE THE ALTAR

AND EVERY POT IN JERUSALEM AND JUDAH SHALL BE HOLY TO THE LORD OF HOSTS SO THAT ALL WHO SACRIFICE MAY COME AND TAKE OF THEM AND BOIL THE MEAT OF THE SACRIFICE IN THEM

AND THERE SHALL NO LONGER BE A TRADER IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS ON THAT DAY

NEHEMIAHTHE WORDS OF NEHEMIAH THE SON OF HACALIAH

NOW IT HAPPENED IN THE MONTH OF CHISLEV IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR AS I WAS IN SUSA THE CAPITAL THAT HANANI ONE OF MY BROTHERS CAME WITH CERTAIN MEN FROM JUDAH

AND I ASKED THEM CONCERNING THE JEWS WHO ESCAPED WHO HAD SURVIVED THE EXILE AND CONCERNING JERUSALEM

AND THEY SAID TO ME THE REMNANT THERE IN THE PROVINCE WHO HAD SURVIVED THE EXILE IS IN GREAT TROUBLE AND SHAME

THE WALL OF JERUSALEM IS BROKEN DOWN AND ITS GATES ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE

 AS SOON AS I HEARD THESE WORDS I SAT DOWN AND WEPT AND MOURNED FOR DAYS AND I CONTINUED FASTING AND PRAYING BEFORE THE GOD OF HEAVEN

AND I SAID O LORD GOD OF HEAVEN THE GREAT AND AWESOME GOD WHO KEEPS COVENANT AND STEADFAST LOVE WITH THOSE WHO LOVE HIM AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS LET YOUR EAR BE ATTENTIVE AND YOUR EYES OPEN TO HEAR THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANT THAT I NOW PRAY BEFORE YOU DAY AND NIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL YOUR SERVANTS CONFESSING THE SINS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU

EVEN I AND MY FATHER'S HOUSE HAVE SINNED

WE HAVE ACTED VERY CORRUPTLY AGAINST YOU AND HAVE NOT KEPT THE COMMANDMENTS THE STATUTES AND THE RULES THAT YOU COMMANDED YOUR SERVANT MOSES

REMEMBER THE WORD THAT YOU COMMANDED YOUR SERVANT MOSES SAYING 'IF YOU ARE UNFAITHFUL I WILL SCATTER YOU AMONG THE PEOPLES BUT IF YOU RETURN TO ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND DO THEM THOUGH YOUR DISPERSED BE UNDER THE FARTHEST SKIES I WILL GATHER THEM FROM THERE AND BRING THEM TO THE PLACE THAT I HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE MY NAME DWELL THERE

' THEY ARE YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE REDEEMED BY YOUR GREAT POWER AND BY YOUR STRONG HAND

O LORD LET YOUR EAR BE ATTENTIVE TO THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANT AND TO THE PRAYER OF YOUR SERVANTS WHO DELIGHT TO FEAR YOUR NAME AND GIVE SUCCESS TO YOUR SERVANT TODAY AND GRANT HIM MERCY IN THE SIGHT OF THIS MAN

NOW I WAS CUPBEARER TO THE KING

IN THE MONTH OF NISAN IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR OF KING ARTAXERXES WHEN WINE WAS BEFORE HIM I TOOK UP THE WINE AND GAVE IT TO THE KING

NOW I HAD NOT BEEN SAD IN HIS PRESENCE

AND THE KING SAID TO ME WHY IS YOUR FACE SAD SEEING YOU ARE NOT SICK

THIS IS NOTHING BUT SADNESS OF THE HEART

 THEN I WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID

I SAID TO THE KING LET THE KING LIVE FOREVER

WHY SHOULD NOT MY FACE BE SAD WHEN THE CITY THE PLACE OF MY FATHERS' GRAVES LIES IN RUINS AND ITS GATES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY FIRE

 THEN THE KING SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU REQUESTING

 SO I PRAYED TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN

AND I SAID TO THE KING IF IT PLEASES THE KING AND IF YOUR SERVANT HAS FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT THAT YOU SEND ME TO JUDAH TO THE CITY OF MY FATHERS' GRAVES THAT I MAY REBUILD IT

 AND THE KING SAID TO ME THE QUEEN SITTING BESIDE HIM HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE AND WHEN WILL YOU RETURN

 SO IT PLEASED THE KING TO SEND ME WHEN I HAD GIVEN HIM A TIME

AND I SAID TO THE KING IF IT PLEASES THE KING LET LETTERS BE GIVEN ME TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER THAT THEY MAY LET ME PASS THROUGH UNTIL I COME TO JUDAH AND A LETTER TO ASAPH THE KEEPER OF THE KING'S FOREST THAT HE MAY GIVE ME TIMBER TO MAKE BEAMS FOR THE GATES OF THE FORTRESS OF THE TEMPLE AND FOR THE WALL OF THE CITY AND FOR THE HOUSE THAT I SHALL OCCUPY

 AND THE KING GRANTED ME WHAT I ASKED FOR THE GOOD HAND OF MY GOD WAS UPON ME

THEN I CAME TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER AND GAVE THEM THE KING'S LETTERS

NOW THE KING HAD SENT WITH ME OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND HORSEMEN

BUT WHEN SANBALLAT THE HORONITE AND TOBIAH THE AMMONITE SERVANT HEARD THIS IT DISPLEASED THEM GREATLY THAT SOMEONE HAD COME TO SEEK THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

SO I WENT TO JERUSALEM AND WAS THERE THREE DAYS

THEN I AROSE IN THE NIGHT I AND A FEW MEN WITH ME

AND I TOLD NO ONE WHAT MY GOD HAD PUT INTO MY HEART TO DO FOR JERUSALEM

THERE WAS NO ANIMAL WITH ME BUT THE ONE ON WHICH I RODE

I WENT OUT BY NIGHT BY THE VALLEY GATE TO THE DRAGON SPRING AND TO THE DUNG GATE AND I INSPECTED THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM THAT WERE BROKEN DOWN AND ITS GATES THAT HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY FIRE

THEN I WENT ON TO THE FOUNTAIN GATE AND TO THE KING'S POOL BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THE ANIMAL THAT WAS UNDER ME TO PASS

THEN I WENT UP IN THE NIGHT BY THE VALLEY AND INSPECTED THE WALL AND I TURNED BACK AND ENTERED BY THE VALLEY GATE AND SO RETURNED

AND THE OFFICIALS DID NOT KNOW WHERE I HAD GONE OR WHAT I WAS DOING AND I HAD NOT YET TOLD THE JEWS THE PRIESTS THE NOBLES THE OFFICIALS AND THE REST WHO WERE TO DO THE WORK

THEN I SAID TO THEM YOU SEE THE TROUBLE WE ARE IN HOW JERUSALEM LIES IN RUINS WITH ITS GATES BURNED

COME LET US BUILD THE WALL OF JERUSALEM THAT WE MAY NO LONGER SUFFER DERISION

 AND I TOLD THEM OF THE HAND OF MY GOD THAT HAD BEEN UPON ME FOR GOOD AND ALSO OF THE WORDS THAT THE KING HAD SPOKEN TO ME

AND THEY SAID LET US RISE UP AND BUILD

 SO THEY STRENGTHENED THEIR HANDS FOR THE GOOD WORK

BUT WHEN SANBALLAT THE HORONITE AND TOBIAH THE AMMONITE SERVANT AND GESHEM THE ARAB HEARD OF IT THEY JEERED AT US AND DESPISED US AND SAID WHAT IS THIS THING THAT YOU ARE DOING

ARE YOU REBELLING AGAINST THE KING

 THEN I REPLIED TO THEM THE GOD OF HEAVEN WILL MAKE US PROSPER AND WE HIS SERVANTS WILL ARISE AND BUILD BUT YOU HAVE NO PORTION OR RIGHT OR CLAIM IN JERUSALEM

THEN ELIASHIB THE HIGH PRIEST ROSE UP WITH HIS BROTHERS THE PRIESTS AND THEY BUILT THE SHEEP GATE

THEY CONSECRATED IT AS FAR AS THE TOWER OF THE HUNDRED AS FAR AS THE TOWER OF HANANEL

AND BETWEEN THE UPPER CHAMBER OF THE CORNER AND THE SHEEP GATE THE GOLDSMITHS AND THE MERCHANTS REPAIRED

NOW WHEN SANBALLAT HEARD THAT WE WERE BUILDING THE WALL HE WAS ANGRY AND GREATLY ENRAGED AND HE JEERED AT THE JEWS

AND HE SAID IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BROTHERS AND OF THE ARMY OF SAMARIA WHAT ARE THESE FEEBLE JEWS DOING

WILL THEY RESTORE IT FOR THEMSELVES

WILL THEY SACRIFICE

WILL THEY FINISH UP IN A DAY

WILL THEY REVIVE THE STONES OUT OF THE HEAPS OF RUBBISH AND BURNED ONES AT THAT

 TOBIAH THE AMMONITE WAS BESIDE HIM AND HE SAID YES WHAT THEY ARE BUILDINGIF A FOX GOES UP ON IT HE WILL BREAK DOWN THEIR STONE WALL

 HEAR O OUR GOD FOR WE ARE DESPISED

TURN BACK THEIR TAUNT ON THEIR OWN HEADS AND GIVE THEM UP TO BE PLUNDERED IN A LAND WHERE THEY ARE CAPTIVES

DO NOT COVER THEIR GUILT AND LET NOT THEIR SIN BE BLOTTED OUT FROM YOUR SIGHT FOR THEY HAVE PROVOKED YOU TO ANGER IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BUILDERS

SO WE BUILT THE WALL

AND ALL THE WALL WAS JOINED TOGETHER TO HALF ITS HEIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE HAD A MIND TO WORK

BUT WHEN SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH AND THE ARABS AND THE AMMONITES AND THE ASHDODITES HEARD THAT THE REPAIRING OF THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM WAS GOING FORWARD AND THAT THE BREACHES WERE BEGINNING TO BE CLOSED THEY WERE VERY ANGRY

AND THEY ALL PLOTTED TOGETHER TO COME AND FIGHT AGAINST JERUSALEM AND TO CAUSE CONFUSION IN IT

AND WE PRAYED TO OUR GOD AND SET A GUARD AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THEM DAY AND NIGHT

IN JUDAH IT WAS SAID THE STRENGTH OF THOSE WHO BEAR THE BURDENS IS FAILING

THERE IS TOO MUCH RUBBLE

BY OURSELVES WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REBUILD THE WALL

 AND OUR ENEMIES SAID THEY WILL NOT KNOW OR SEE TILL WE COME AMONG THEM AND KILL THEM AND STOP THE WORK

 AT THAT TIME THE JEWS WHO LIVED NEAR THEM CAME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS AND SAID TO US TEN TIMES YOU MUST RETURN TO US

 SO IN THE LOWEST PARTS OF THE SPACE BEHIND THE WALL IN OPEN PLACES I STATIONED THE PEOPLE BY THEIR CLANS WITH THEIR SWORDS THEIR SPEARS AND THEIR BOWS

AND I LOOKED AND AROSE AND SAID TO THE NOBLES AND TO THE OFFICIALS AND TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM

REMEMBER THE LORD WHO IS GREAT AND AWESOME AND FIGHT FOR YOUR BROTHERS YOUR SONS YOUR DAUGHTERS YOUR WIVES AND YOUR HOMES

 WHEN OUR ENEMIES HEARD THAT IT WAS KNOWN TO US AND THAT GOD HAD FRUSTRATED THEIR PLAN WE ALL RETURNED TO THE WALL EACH TO HIS WORK

FROM THAT DAY ON HALF OF MY SERVANTS WORKED ON CONSTRUCTION AND HALF HELD THE SPEARS SHIELDS BOWS AND COATS OF MAIL

AND THE LEADERS STOOD BEHIND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF JUDAH WHO WERE BUILDING ON THE WALL

THOSE WHO CARRIED BURDENS WERE LOADED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH LABORED ON THE WORK WITH ONE HAND AND HELD HIS WEAPON WITH THE OTHER

AND EACH OF THE BUILDERS HAD HIS SWORD STRAPPED AT HIS SIDE WHILE HE BUILT

THE MAN WHO SOUNDED THE TRUMPET WAS BESIDE ME

AND I SAID TO THE NOBLES AND TO THE OFFICIALS AND TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THE WORK IS GREAT AND WIDELY SPREAD AND WE ARE SEPARATED ON THE WALL FAR FROM ONE ANOTHER

IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET RALLY TO US THERE

OUR GOD WILL FIGHT FOR US

 SO WE LABORED AT THE WORK AND HALF OF THEM HELD THE SPEARS FROM THE BREAK OF DAWN UNTIL THE STARS CAME OUT

I ALSO SAID TO THE PEOPLE AT THAT TIME LET EVERY MAN AND HIS SERVANT PASS THE NIGHT WITHIN JERUSALEM THAT THEY MAY BE A GUARD FOR US BY NIGHT AND MAY LABOR BY DAY

 SO NEITHER I NOR MY BROTHERS NOR MY SERVANTS NOR THE MEN OF THE GUARD WHO FOLLOWED ME NONE OF US TOOK OFF OUR CLOTHES; EACH KEPT HIS WEAPON AT HIS RIGHT HAND

NOW THERE AROSE A GREAT OUTCRY OF THE PEOPLE AND OF THEIR WIVES AGAINST THEIR JEWISH BROTHERS

FOR THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID WITH OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS WE ARE MANY

SO LET US GET GRAIN THAT WE MAY EAT AND KEEP ALIVE

 THERE WERE ALSO THOSE WHO SAID WE ARE MORTGAGING OUR FIELDS OUR VINEYARDS AND OUR HOUSES TO GET GRAIN BECAUSE OF THE FAMINE

 AND THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID WE HAVE BORROWED MONEY FOR THE KING'S TAX ON OUR FIELDS AND OUR VINEYARDS

NOW OUR FLESH IS AS THE FLESH OF OUR BROTHERS OUR CHILDREN ARE AS THEIR CHILDREN

YET WE ARE FORCING OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS TO BE SLAVES AND SOME OF OUR DAUGHTERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENSLAVED BUT IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER TO HELP IT FOR OTHER MEN HAVE OUR FIELDS AND OUR VINEYARDS

 I WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN I HEARD THEIR OUTCRY AND THESE WORDS

I TOOK COUNSEL WITH MYSELF AND I BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST THE NOBLES AND THE OFFICIALS

I SAID TO THEM YOU ARE EXACTING INTEREST EACH FROM HIS BROTHER

 AND I HELD A GREAT ASSEMBLY AGAINST THEM AND SAID TO THEM WE AS FAR AS WE ARE ABLE HAVE BOUGHT BACK OUR JEWISH BROTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN SOLD TO THE NATIONS BUT YOU EVEN SELL YOUR BROTHERS THAT THEY MAY BE SOLD TO US

 THEY WERE SILENT AND COULD NOT FIND A WORD TO SAY

SO I SAID THE THING THAT YOU ARE DOING IS NOT GOOD

OUGHT YOU NOT TO WALK IN THE FEAR OF OUR GOD TO PREVENT THE TAUNTS OF THE NATIONS OUR ENEMIES

MOREOVER I AND MY BROTHERS AND MY SERVANTS ARE LENDING THEM MONEY AND GRAIN

LET US ABANDON THIS EXACTING OF INTEREST

RETURN TO THEM THIS VERY DAY THEIR FIELDS THEIR VINEYARDS THEIR OLIVE ORCHARDS AND THEIR HOUSES AND THE PERCENTAGE OF MONEY GRAIN WINE AND OIL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EXACTING FROM THEM

 THEN THEY SAID WE WILL RESTORE THESE AND REQUIRE NOTHING FROM THEM

WE WILL DO AS YOU SAY

 AND I CALLED THE PRIESTS AND MADE THEM SWEAR TO DO AS THEY HAD PROMISED

I ALSO SHOOK OUT THE FOLD OF MY GARMENT AND SAID SO MAY GOD SHAKE OUT EVERY MAN FROM HIS HOUSE AND FROM HIS LABOR WHO DOES NOT KEEP THIS PROMISE

SO MAY HE BE SHAKEN OUT AND EMPTIED

 AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY SAID AMEN AND PRAISED THE LORD

AND THE PEOPLE DID AS THEY HAD PROMISED

MOREOVER FROM THE TIME THAT I WAS APPOINTED TO BE THEIR GOVERNOR IN THE LAND OF JUDAH FROM THE TWENTIETH YEAR TO THE THIRTYSECOND YEAR OF ARTAXERXES THE KING TWELVE YEARS NEITHER I NOR MY BROTHERS ATE THE FOOD ALLOWANCE OF THE GOVERNOR

THE FORMER GOVERNORS WHO WERE BEFORE ME LAID HEAVY BURDENS ON THE PEOPLE AND TOOK FROM THEM FOR THEIR DAILY RATION FORTY SHEKELS OF SILVER

EVEN THEIR SERVANTS LORDED IT OVER THE PEOPLE

BUT I DID NOT DO SO BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF GOD

I ALSO PERSEVERED IN THE WORK ON THIS WALL AND WE ACQUIRED NO LAND AND ALL MY SERVANTS WERE GATHERED THERE FOR THE WORK

MOREOVER THERE WERE AT MY TABLE  MEN JEWS AND OFFICIALS BESIDES THOSE WHO CAME TO US FROM THE NATIONS THAT WERE AROUND US

NOW WHAT WAS PREPARED AT MY EXPENSE FOR EACH DAY WAS ONE OX AND SIX CHOICE SHEEP AND BIRDS AND EVERY TEN DAYS ALL KINDS OF WINE IN ABUNDANCE

YET FOR ALL THIS I DID NOT DEMAND THE FOOD ALLOWANCE OF THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE THE SERVICE WAS TOO HEAVY ON THIS PEOPLE

REMEMBER FOR MY GOOD O MY GOD ALL THAT I HAVE DONE FOR THIS PEOPLE

NOW WHEN SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH AND GESHEM THE ARAB AND THE REST OF OUR ENEMIES HEARD THAT I HAD BUILT THE WALL AND THAT THERE WAS NO BREACH LEFT IN IT ALTHOUGH UP TO THAT TIME I HAD NOT SET UP THE DOORS IN THE GATES SANBALLAT AND GESHEM SENT TO ME SAYING COME AND LET US MEET TOGETHER AT HAKKEPHIRIM IN THE PLAIN OF ONO

 BUT THEY INTENDED TO DO ME HARM

AND I SENT MESSENGERS TO THEM SAYING I AM DOING A GREAT WORK AND I CANNOT COME DOWN

WHY SHOULD THE WORK STOP WHILE I LEAVE IT AND COME DOWN TO YOU

 AND THEY SENT TO ME FOUR TIMES IN THIS WAY AND I ANSWERED THEM IN THE SAME MANNER

IN THE SAME WAY SANBALLAT FOR THE FIFTH TIME SENT HIS SERVANT TO ME WITH AN OPEN LETTER IN HIS HAND

IN IT WAS WRITTEN IT IS REPORTED AMONG THE NATIONS AND GESHEM ALSO SAYS IT THAT YOU AND THE JEWS INTEND TO REBEL; THAT IS WHY YOU ARE BUILDING THE WALL

AND ACCORDING TO THESE REPORTS YOU WISH TO BECOME THEIR KING

AND YOU HAVE ALSO SET UP PROPHETS TO PROCLAIM CONCERNING YOU IN JERUSALEM 'THERE IS A KING IN JUDAH

' AND NOW THE KING WILL HEAR OF THESE REPORTS

SO NOW COME AND LET US TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER

 THEN I SENT TO HIM SAYING NO SUCH THINGS AS YOU SAY HAVE BEEN DONE FOR YOU ARE INVENTING THEM OUT OF YOUR OWN MIND

 FOR THEY ALL WANTED TO FRIGHTEN US THINKING THEIR HANDS WILL DROP FROM THE WORK AND IT WILL NOT BE DONE

 BUT NOW O GOD STRENGTHEN MY HANDS

NOW WHEN I WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF SHEMAIAH THE SON OF DELAIAH SON OF MEHETABEL WHO WAS CONFINED TO HIS HOME HE SAID LET US MEET TOGETHER IN THE HOUSE OF GOD WITHIN THE TEMPLE

LET US CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE TEMPLE FOR THEY ARE COMING TO KILL YOU

THEY ARE COMING TO KILL YOU BY NIGHT

 BUT I SAID SHOULD SUCH A MAN AS I RUN AWAY

AND WHAT MAN SUCH AS I COULD GO INTO THE TEMPLE AND LIVE

I WILL NOT GO IN

 AND I UNDERSTOOD AND SAW THAT GOD HAD NOT SENT HIM BUT HE HAD PRONOUNCED THE PROPHECY AGAINST ME BECAUSE TOBIAH AND SANBALLAT HAD HIRED HIM

FOR THIS PURPOSE HE WAS HIRED THAT I SHOULD BE AFRAID AND ACT IN THIS WAY AND SIN AND SO THEY COULD GIVE ME A BAD NAME IN ORDER TO TAUNT ME

REMEMBER TOBIAH AND SANBALLAT O MY GOD ACCORDING TO THESE THINGS THAT THEY DID AND ALSO THE PROPHETESS NOADIAH AND THE REST OF THE PROPHETS WHO WANTED TO MAKE ME AFRAID

SO THE WALL WAS FINISHED ON THE TWENTYFIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH ELUL IN FIFTYTWO DAYS

AND WHEN ALL OUR ENEMIES HEARD OF IT ALL THE NATIONS AROUND US WERE AFRAID AND FELL GREATLY IN THEIR OWN ESTEEM FOR THEY PERCEIVED THAT THIS WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE HELP OF OUR GOD

MOREOVER IN THOSE DAYS THE NOBLES OF JUDAH SENT MANY LETTERS TO TOBIAH AND TOBIAH'S LETTERS CAME TO THEM

FOR MANY IN JUDAH WERE BOUND BY OATH TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS THE SONINLAW OF SHECANIAH THE SON OF ARAH AND HIS SON JEHOHANAN HAD TAKEN THE DAUGHTER OF MESHULLAM THE SON OF BERECHIAH AS HIS WIFE

ALSO THEY SPOKE OF HIS GOOD DEEDS IN MY PRESENCE AND REPORTED MY WORDS TO HIM

AND TOBIAH SENT LETTERS TO MAKE ME AFRAID

NOW WHEN THE WALL HAD BEEN BUILT AND I HAD SET UP THE DOORS AND THE GATEKEEPERS THE SINGERS AND THE LEVITES HAD BEEN APPOINTED I GAVE MY BROTHER HANANI AND HANANIAH THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE CHARGE OVER JERUSALEM FOR HE WAS A MORE FAITHFUL AND GODFEARING MAN THAN MANY

AND I SAID TO THEM LET NOT THE GATES OF JERUSALEM BE OPENED UNTIL THE SUN IS HOT

AND WHILE THEY ARE STILL STANDING GUARD LET THEM SHUT AND BAR THE DOORS

APPOINT GUARDS FROM AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM SOME AT THEIR GUARD POSTS AND SOME IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN HOMES

 THE CITY WAS WIDE AND LARGE BUT THE PEOPLE WITHIN IT WERE FEW AND NO HOUSES HAD BEEN REBUILT

THEN MY GOD PUT IT INTO MY HEART TO ASSEMBLE THE NOBLES AND THE OFFICIALS AND THE PEOPLE TO BE ENROLLED BY GENEALOGY

AND I FOUND THE BOOK OF THE GENEALOGY OF THOSE WHO CAME UP AT THE FIRST AND I FOUND WRITTEN IN IT THESE WERE THE PEOPLE OF THE PROVINCE WHO CAME UP OUT OF THE CAPTIVITY OF THOSE EXILES WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR THE KING OF BABYLON HAD CARRIED INTO EXILE

THEY RETURNED TO JERUSALEM AND JUDAH EACH TO HIS TOWN

THEY CAME WITH ZERUBBABEL JESHUA NEHEMIAH AZARIAH RAAMIAH NAHAMANI MORDECAI BILSHAN MISPERETH BIGVAI NEHUM BAANAH

ALL THE TEMPLE SERVANTS AND THE SONS OF SOLOMON'S SERVANTS WERE 

THE FOLLOWING WERE THOSE WHO CAME UP FROM TELMELAH TELHARSHA CHERUB ADDON AND IMMER BUT THEY COULD NOT PROVE THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES NOR THEIR DESCENT WHETHER THEY BELONGED TO ISRAEL THE SONS OF DELAIAH THE SONS OF TOBIAH THE SONS OF NEKODA 

ALSO OF THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF HOBAIAH THE SONS OF HAKKOZ THE SONS OF BARZILLAI WHO HAD TAKEN A WIFE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF BARZILLAI THE GILEADITE AND WAS CALLED BY THEIR NAME

THESE SOUGHT THEIR REGISTRATION AMONG THOSE ENROLLED IN THE GENEALOGIES BUT IT WAS NOT FOUND THERE SO THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD AS UNCLEAN

THE GOVERNOR TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE NOT TO PARTAKE OF THE MOST HOLY FOOD UNTIL A PRIEST WITH URIM AND THUMMIM SHOULD ARISE

THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER WAS  BESIDES THEIR MALE AND FEMALE SERVANTS OF WHOM THERE WERE 

AND THEY HAD  SINGERS MALE AND FEMALE

THEIR HORSES WERE  THEIR MULES  THEIR CAMELS  AND THEIR DONKEYS 

NOW SOME OF THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES GAVE TO THE WORK

THE GOVERNOR GAVE TO THE TREASURY  DARICS OF GOLD  BASINS  PRIESTS' GARMENTS AND  MINAS OF SILVER

AND SOME OF THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES GAVE INTO THE TREASURY OF THE WORK  DARICS OF GOLD AND  MINAS OF SILVER

AND WHAT THE REST OF THE PEOPLE GAVE WAS  DARICS OF GOLD  MINAS OF SILVER AND  PRIESTS' GARMENTS

SO THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES THE GATEKEEPERS THE SINGERS SOME OF THE PEOPLE THE TEMPLE SERVANTS AND ALL ISRAEL LIVED IN THEIR TOWNS

AND WHEN THE SEVENTH MONTH HAD COME THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE IN THEIR TOWNS

AND ALL THE PEOPLE GATHERED AS ONE MAN INTO THE SQUARE BEFORE THE WATER GATE

AND THEY TOLD EZRA THE SCRIBE TO BRING THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF MOSES THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED ISRAEL

SO EZRA THE PRIEST BROUGHT THE LAW BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND ALL WHO COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HEARD ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH

AND HE READ FROM IT FACING THE SQUARE BEFORE THE WATER GATE FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL MIDDAY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MEN AND THE WOMEN AND THOSE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND

AND THE EARS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WERE ATTENTIVE TO THE BOOK OF THE LAW

AND EZRA THE SCRIBE STOOD ON A WOODEN PLATFORM THAT THEY HAD MADE FOR THE PURPOSE

AND BESIDE HIM STOOD MATTITHIAH SHEMA ANAIAH URIAH HILKIAH AND MAASEIAH ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND PEDAIAH MISHAEL MALCHIJAH HASHUM HASHBADDANAH ZECHARIAH AND MESHULLAM ON HIS LEFT HAND

AND EZRA OPENED THE BOOK IN THE SIGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE FOR HE WAS ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE AND AS HE OPENED IT ALL THE PEOPLE STOOD

AND EZRA BLESSED THE LORD THE GREAT GOD AND ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED AMEN AMEN LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS

AND THEY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND WORSHIPED THE LORD WITH THEIR FACES TO THE GROUND

ALSO JESHUA BANI SHEREBIAH JAMIN AKKUB SHABBETHAI HODIAH MAASEIAH KELITA AZARIAH JOZABAD HANAN PELAIAH THE LEVITES HELPED THE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW WHILE THE PEOPLE REMAINED IN THEIR PLACES

THEY READ FROM THE BOOK FROM THE LAW OF GOD CLEARLY AND THEY GAVE THE SENSE SO THAT THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE READING

AND NEHEMIAH WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR AND EZRA THE PRIEST AND SCRIBE AND THE LEVITES WHO TAUGHT THE PEOPLE SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE THIS DAY IS HOLY TO THE LORD YOUR GOD; DO NOT MOURN OR WEEP

 FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WEPT AS THEY HEARD THE WORDS OF THE LAW

THEN HE SAID TO THEM GO YOUR WAY

EAT THE FAT AND DRINK SWEET WINE AND SEND PORTIONS TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOTHING READY FOR THIS DAY IS HOLY TO OUR LORD

AND DO NOT BE GRIEVED FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH

 SO THE LEVITES CALMED ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING BE QUIET FOR THIS DAY IS HOLY; DO NOT BE GRIEVED

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE WENT THEIR WAY TO EAT AND DRINK AND TO SEND PORTIONS AND TO MAKE GREAT REJOICING BECAUSE THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS THAT WERE DECLARED TO THEM

ON THE SECOND DAY THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES OF ALL THE PEOPLE WITH THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES CAME TOGETHER TO EZRA THE SCRIBE IN ORDER TO STUDY THE WORDS OF THE LAW

AND THEY FOUND IT WRITTEN IN THE LAW THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED BY MOSES THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHOULD DWELL IN BOOTHS DURING THE FEAST OF THE SEVENTH MONTH AND THAT THEY SHOULD PROCLAIM IT AND PUBLISH IT IN ALL THEIR TOWNS AND IN JERUSALEM GO OUT TO THE HILLS AND BRING BRANCHES OF OLIVE WILD OLIVE MYRTLE PALM AND OTHER LEAFY TREES TO MAKE BOOTHS AS IT IS WRITTEN

 SO THE PEOPLE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT THEM AND MADE BOOTHS FOR THEMSELVES EACH ON HIS ROOF AND IN THEIR COURTS AND IN THE COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD AND IN THE SQUARE AT THE WATER GATE AND IN THE SQUARE AT THE GATE OF EPHRAIM

AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF THOSE WHO HAD RETURNED FROM THE CAPTIVITY MADE BOOTHS AND LIVED IN THE BOOTHS FOR FROM THE DAYS OF JESHUA THE SON OF NUN TO THAT DAY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD NOT DONE SO

AND THERE WAS VERY GREAT REJOICING

AND DAY BY DAY FROM THE FIRST DAY TO THE LAST DAY HE READ FROM THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF GOD

THEY KEPT THE FEAST SEVEN DAYS AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THERE WAS A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY ACCORDING TO THE RULE

NOW ON THE TWENTYFOURTH DAY OF THIS MONTH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE ASSEMBLED WITH FASTING AND IN SACKCLOTH AND WITH EARTH ON THEIR HEADS

AND THE ISRAELITES SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM ALL FOREIGNERS AND STOOD AND CONFESSED THEIR SINS AND THE INIQUITIES OF THEIR FATHERS

AND THEY STOOD UP IN THEIR PLACE AND READ FROM THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF THE LORD THEIR GOD FOR A QUARTER OF THE DAY; FOR ANOTHER QUARTER OF IT THEY MADE CONFESSION AND WORSHIPED THE LORD THEIR GOD

ON THE STAIRS OF THE LEVITES STOOD JESHUA BANI KADMIEL SHEBANIAH BUNNI SHEREBIAH BANI AND CHENANI; AND THEY CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE TO THE LORD THEIR GOD

THEN THE LEVITES JESHUA KADMIEL BANI HASHABNEIAH SHEREBIAH HODIAH SHEBANIAH AND PETHAHIAH SAID STAND UP AND BLESS THE LORD YOUR GOD FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING

BLESSED BE YOUR GLORIOUS NAME WHICH IS EXALTED ABOVE ALL BLESSING AND PRAISE

YOU ARE THE LORD YOU ALONE

YOU HAVE MADE HEAVEN THE HEAVEN OF HEAVENS WITH ALL THEIR HOST THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS ON IT THE SEAS AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM; AND YOU PRESERVE ALL OF THEM; AND THE HOST OF HEAVEN WORSHIPS YOU

YOU ARE THE LORD THE GOD WHO CHOSE ABRAM AND BROUGHT HIM OUT OF UR OF THE CHALDEANS AND GAVE HIM THE NAME ABRAHAM

YOU FOUND HIS HEART FAITHFUL BEFORE YOU AND MADE WITH HIM THE COVENANT TO GIVE TO HIS OFFSPRING THE LAND OF THE CANAANITE THE HITTITE THE AMORITE THE PERIZZITE THE JEBUSITE AND THE GIRGASHITE

AND YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR PROMISE FOR YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS

AND YOU SAW THE AFFLICTION OF OUR FATHERS IN EGYPT AND HEARD THEIR CRY AT THE RED SEA AND PERFORMED SIGNS AND WONDERS AGAINST PHARAOH AND ALL HIS SERVANTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF HIS LAND FOR YOU KNEW THAT THEY ACTED ARROGANTLY AGAINST OUR FATHERS

AND YOU MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF AS IT IS TO THIS DAY

AND YOU DIVIDED THE SEA BEFORE THEM SO THAT THEY WENT THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE SEA ON DRY LAND AND YOU CAST THEIR PURSUERS INTO THE DEPTHS AS A STONE INTO MIGHTY WATERS

BY A PILLAR OF CLOUD YOU LED THEM IN THE DAY AND BY A PILLAR OF FIRE IN THE NIGHT TO LIGHT FOR THEM THE WAY IN WHICH THEY SHOULD GO

YOU CAME DOWN ON MOUNT SINAI AND SPOKE WITH THEM FROM HEAVEN AND GAVE THEM RIGHT RULES AND TRUE LAWS GOOD STATUTES AND COMMANDMENTS AND YOU MADE KNOWN TO THEM YOUR HOLY SABBATH AND COMMANDED THEM COMMANDMENTS AND STATUTES AND A LAW BY MOSES YOUR SERVANT

YOU GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN FOR THEIR HUNGER AND BROUGHT WATER FOR THEM OUT OF THE ROCK FOR THEIR THIRST AND YOU TOLD THEM TO GO IN TO POSSESS THE LAND THAT YOU HAD SWORN TO GIVE THEM

BUT THEY AND OUR FATHERS ACTED PRESUMPTUOUSLY AND STIFFENED THEIR NECK AND DID NOT OBEY YOUR COMMANDMENTS

THEY REFUSED TO OBEY AND WERE NOT MINDFUL OF THE WONDERS THAT YOU PERFORMED AMONG THEM BUT THEY STIFFENED THEIR NECK AND APPOINTED A LEADER TO RETURN TO THEIR SLAVERY IN EGYPT

BUT YOU ARE A GOD READY TO FORGIVE GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE AND DID NOT FORSAKE THEM

EVEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE FOR THEMSELVES A GOLDEN CALF AND SAID 'THIS IS YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF EGYPT' AND HAD COMMITTED GREAT BLASPHEMIES YOU IN YOUR GREAT MERCIES DID NOT FORSAKE THEM IN THE WILDERNESS

THE PILLAR OF CLOUD TO LEAD THEM IN THE WAY DID NOT DEPART FROM THEM BY DAY NOR THE PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT TO LIGHT FOR THEM THE WAY BY WHICH THEY SHOULD GO

YOU GAVE YOUR GOOD SPIRIT TO INSTRUCT THEM AND DID NOT WITHHOLD YOUR MANNA FROM THEIR MOUTH AND GAVE THEM WATER FOR THEIR THIRST

FORTY YEARS YOU SUSTAINED THEM IN THE WILDERNESS AND THEY LACKED NOTHING

THEIR CLOTHES DID NOT WEAR OUT AND THEIR FEET DID NOT SWELL

AND YOU GAVE THEM KINGDOMS AND PEOPLES AND ALLOTTED TO THEM EVERY CORNER

SO THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LAND OF SIHON KING OF HESHBON AND THE LAND OF OG KING OF BASHAN

YOU MULTIPLIED THEIR CHILDREN AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND YOU BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LAND THAT YOU HAD TOLD THEIR FATHERS TO ENTER AND POSSESS

SO THE DESCENDANTS WENT IN AND POSSESSED THE LAND AND YOU SUBDUED BEFORE THEM THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND THE CANAANITES AND GAVE THEM INTO THEIR HAND WITH THEIR KINGS AND THE PEOPLES OF THE LAND THAT THEY MIGHT DO WITH THEM AS THEY WOULD

AND THEY CAPTURED FORTIFIED CITIES AND A RICH LAND AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HOUSES FULL OF ALL GOOD THINGS CISTERNS ALREADY HEWN VINEYARDS OLIVE ORCHARDS AND FRUIT TREES IN ABUNDANCE

SO THEY ATE AND WERE FILLED AND BECAME FAT AND DELIGHTED THEMSELVES IN YOUR GREAT GOODNESS

NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE DISOBEDIENT AND REBELLED AGAINST YOU AND CAST YOUR LAW BEHIND THEIR BACK AND KILLED YOUR PROPHETS WHO HAD WARNED THEM IN ORDER TO TURN THEM BACK TO YOU AND THEY COMMITTED GREAT BLASPHEMIES

THEREFORE YOU GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES WHO MADE THEM SUFFER

AND IN THE TIME OF THEIR SUFFERING THEY CRIED OUT TO YOU AND YOU HEARD THEM FROM HEAVEN AND ACCORDING TO YOUR GREAT MERCIES YOU GAVE THEM SAVIORS WHO SAVED THEM FROM THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES

BUT AFTER THEY HAD REST THEY DID EVIL AGAIN BEFORE YOU AND YOU ABANDONED THEM TO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES SO THAT THEY HAD DOMINION OVER THEM

YET WHEN THEY TURNED AND CRIED TO YOU YOU HEARD FROM HEAVEN AND MANY TIMES YOU DELIVERED THEM ACCORDING TO YOUR MERCIES

AND YOU WARNED THEM IN ORDER TO TURN THEM BACK TO YOUR LAW

YET THEY ACTED PRESUMPTUOUSLY AND DID NOT OBEY YOUR COMMANDMENTS BUT SINNED AGAINST YOUR RULES WHICH IF A PERSON DOES THEM HE SHALL LIVE BY THEM AND TURNED A STUBBORN SHOULDER AND STIFFENED THEIR NECK AND WOULD NOT OBEY

MANY YEARS YOU BORE WITH THEM AND WARNED THEM BY YOUR SPIRIT THROUGH YOUR PROPHETS

YET THEY WOULD NOT GIVE EAR

THEREFORE YOU GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE PEOPLES OF THE LANDS

NEVERTHELESS IN YOUR GREAT MERCIES YOU DID NOT MAKE AN END OF THEM OR FORSAKE THEM FOR YOU ARE A GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL GOD

NOW THEREFORE OUR GOD THE GREAT THE MIGHTY AND THE AWESOME GOD WHO KEEPS COVENANT AND STEADFAST LOVE LET NOT ALL THE HARDSHIP SEEM LITTLE TO YOU THAT HAS COME UPON US UPON OUR KINGS OUR PRINCES OUR PRIESTS OUR PROPHETS OUR FATHERS AND ALL YOUR PEOPLE SINCE THE TIME OF THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA UNTIL THIS DAY

NOW THE LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE LIVED IN JERUSALEM

AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE CAST LOTS TO BRING ONE OUT OF TEN TO LIVE IN JERUSALEM THE HOLY CITY WHILE NINE OUT OF TEN REMAINED IN THE OTHER TOWNS

AND THE PEOPLE BLESSED ALL THE MEN WHO WILLINGLY OFFERED TO LIVE IN JERUSALEM

THESE ARE THE CHIEFS OF THE PROVINCE WHO LIVED IN JERUSALEM; BUT IN THE TOWNS OF JUDAH EVERYONE LIVED ON HIS PROPERTY IN THEIR TOWNS ISRAEL THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES THE TEMPLE SERVANTS AND THE DESCENDANTS OF SOLOMON'S SERVANTS

AND IN JERUSALEM LIVED CERTAIN OF THE SONS OF JUDAH AND OF THE SONS OF BENJAMIN

ALL THE LEVITES IN THE HOLY CITY WERE 

THE GATEKEEPERS AKKUB TALMON AND THEIR BROTHERS WHO KEPT WATCH AT THE GATES WERE 

AND THE REST OF ISRAEL AND OF THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WERE IN ALL THE TOWNS OF JUDAH EVERY ONE IN HIS INHERITANCE

BUT THE TEMPLE SERVANTS LIVED ON OPHEL; AND ZIHA AND GISHPA WERE OVER THE TEMPLE SERVANTS

THE OVERSEER OF THE LEVITES IN JERUSALEM WAS UZZI THE SON OF BANI SON OF HASHABIAH SON OF MATTANIAH SON OF MICA OF THE SONS OF ASAPH THE SINGERS OVER THE WORK OF THE HOUSE OF GOD

FOR THERE WAS A COMMAND FROM THE KING CONCERNING THEM AND A FIXED PROVISION FOR THE SINGERS AS EVERY DAY REQUIRED

AND PETHAHIAH THE SON OF MESHEZABEL OF THE SONS OF ZERAH THE SON OF JUDAH WAS AT THE KING'S SIDE IN ALL MATTERS CONCERNING THE PEOPLE

AND AS FOR THE VILLAGES WITH THEIR FIELDS SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH LIVED IN KIRIATHARBA AND ITS VILLAGES AND IN DIBON AND ITS VILLAGES AND IN JEKABZEEL AND ITS VILLAGES AND IN JESHUA AND IN MOLADAH AND BETHPELET IN HAZARSHUAL IN BEERSHEBA AND ITS VILLAGES IN ZIKLAG IN MECONAH AND ITS VILLAGES IN ENRIMMON IN ZORAH IN JARMUTH ZANOAH ADULLAM AND THEIR VILLAGES LACHISH AND ITS FIELDS AND AZEKAH AND ITS VILLAGES

SO THEY ENCAMPED FROM BEERSHEBA TO THE VALLEY OF HINNOM

THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN ALSO LIVED FROM GEBA ONWARD AT MICHMASH AIJA BETHEL AND ITS VILLAGES ANATHOTH NOB ANANIAH HAZOR RAMAH GITTAIM HADID ZEBOIM NEBALLAT LOD AND ONO THE VALLEY OF CRAFTSMEN

AND CERTAIN DIVISIONS OF THE LEVITES IN JUDAH WERE ASSIGNED TO BENJAMIN

THESE ARE THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WHO CAME UP WITH ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL AND JESHUA SERAIAH JEREMIAH EZRA AMARIAH MALLUCH HATTUSH SHECANIAH REHUM MEREMOTH IDDO GINNETHOI ABIJAH MIJAMIN MAADIAH BILGAH SHEMAIAH JOIARIB JEDAIAH SALLU AMOK HILKIAH JEDAIAH

THESE WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE PRIESTS AND OF THEIR BROTHERS IN THE DAYS OF JESHUA

AND THE LEVITES JESHUA BINNUI KADMIEL SHEREBIAH JUDAH AND MATTANIAH WHO WITH HIS BROTHERS WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SONGS OF THANKSGIVING

AND BAKBUKIAH AND UNNI AND THEIR BROTHERS STOOD OPPOSITE THEM IN THE SERVICE

AND JESHUA WAS THE FATHER OF JOIAKIM JOIAKIM THE FATHER OF ELIASHIB ELIASHIB THE FATHER OF JOIADA JOIADA THE FATHER OF JONATHAN AND JONATHAN THE FATHER OF JADDUA

AND IN THE DAYS OF JOIAKIM WERE PRIESTS HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES OF SERAIAH MERAIAH; OF JEREMIAH HANANIAH; OF EZRA MESHULLAM; OF AMARIAH JEHOHANAN; OF MALLUCHI JONATHAN; OF SHEBANIAH JOSEPH; OF HARIM ADNA; OF MERAIOTH HELKAI; OF IDDO ZECHARIAH; OF GINNETHON MESHULLAM; OF ABIJAH ZICHRI; OF MINIAMIN OF MOADIAH PILTAI; OF BILGAH SHAMMUA; OF SHEMAIAH JEHONATHAN; OF JOIARIB MATTENAI; OF JEDAIAH UZZI; OF SALLAI KALLAI; OF AMOK EBER; OF HILKIAH HASHABIAH; OF JEDAIAH NETHANEL

IN THE DAYS OF ELIASHIB JOIADA JOHANAN AND JADDUA THE LEVITES WERE RECORDED AS HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES; SO TOO WERE THE PRIESTS IN THE REIGN OF DARIUS THE PERSIAN

AS FOR THE SONS OF LEVI THEIR HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES WERE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES UNTIL THE DAYS OF JOHANAN THE SON OF ELIASHIB

AND THE CHIEFS OF THE LEVITES HASHABIAH SHEREBIAH AND JESHUA THE SON OF KADMIEL WITH THEIR BROTHERS WHO STOOD OPPOSITE THEM TO PRAISE AND TO GIVE THANKS ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF DAVID THE MAN OF GOD WATCH BY WATCH

MATTANIAH BAKBUKIAH OBADIAH MESHULLAM TALMON AND AKKUB WERE GATEKEEPERS STANDING GUARD AT THE STOREHOUSES OF THE GATES

THESE WERE IN THE DAYS OF JOIAKIM THE SON OF JESHUA SON OF JOZADAK AND IN THE DAYS OF NEHEMIAH THE GOVERNOR AND OF EZRA THE PRIEST AND SCRIBE

AND AT THE DEDICATION OF THE WALL OF JERUSALEM THEY SOUGHT THE LEVITES IN ALL THEIR PLACES TO BRING THEM TO JERUSALEM TO CELEBRATE THE DEDICATION WITH GLADNESS WITH THANKSGIVINGS AND WITH SINGING WITH CYMBALS HARPS AND LYRES

AND THE SONS OF THE SINGERS GATHERED TOGETHER FROM THE DISTRICT SURROUNDING JERUSALEM AND FROM THE VILLAGES OF THE NETOPHATHITES; ALSO FROM BETHGILGAL AND FROM THE REGION OF GEBA AND AZMAVETH FOR THE SINGERS HAD BUILT FOR THEMSELVES VILLAGES AROUND JERUSALEM

AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES PURIFIED THEMSELVES AND THEY PURIFIED THE PEOPLE AND THE GATES AND THE WALL

THEN I BROUGHT THE LEADERS OF JUDAH UP ONTO THE WALL AND APPOINTED TWO GREAT CHOIRS THAT GAVE THANKS

ONE WENT TO THE SOUTH ON THE WALL TO THE DUNG GATE

AND AFTER THEM WENT HOSHAIAH AND HALF OF THE LEADERS OF JUDAH AND AZARIAH EZRA MESHULLAM JUDAH BENJAMIN SHEMAIAH AND JEREMIAH AND CERTAIN OF THE PRIESTS' SONS WITH TRUMPETS ZECHARIAH THE SON OF JONATHAN SON OF SHEMAIAH SON OF MATTANIAH SON OF MICAIAH SON OF ZACCUR SON OF ASAPH; AND HIS RELATIVES SHEMAIAH AZAREL MILALAI GILALAI MAAI NETHANEL JUDAH AND HANANI WITH THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF DAVID THE MAN OF GOD

AND EZRA THE SCRIBE WENT BEFORE THEM

AT THE FOUNTAIN GATE THEY WENT UP STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM BY THE STAIRS OF THE CITY OF DAVID AT THE ASCENT OF THE WALL ABOVE THE HOUSE OF DAVID TO THE WATER GATE ON THE EAST

THE OTHER CHOIR OF THOSE WHO GAVE THANKS WENT TO THE NORTH AND I FOLLOWED THEM WITH HALF OF THE PEOPLE ON THE WALL ABOVE THE TOWER OF THE OVENS TO THE BROAD WALL AND ABOVE THE GATE OF EPHRAIM AND BY THE GATE OF YESHANAH AND BY THE FISH GATE AND THE TOWER OF HANANEL AND THE TOWER OF THE HUNDRED TO THE SHEEP GATE; AND THEY CAME TO A HALT AT THE GATE OF THE GUARD

SO BOTH CHOIRS OF THOSE WHO GAVE THANKS STOOD IN THE HOUSE OF GOD AND I AND HALF OF THE OFFICIALS WITH ME; AND THE PRIESTS ELIAKIM MAASEIAH MINIAMIN MICAIAH ELIOENAI ZECHARIAH AND HANANIAH WITH TRUMPETS; AND MAASEIAH SHEMAIAH ELEAZAR UZZI JEHOHANAN MALCHIJAH ELAM AND EZER

AND THE SINGERS SANG WITH JEZRAHIAH AS THEIR LEADER

AND THEY OFFERED GREAT SACRIFICES THAT DAY AND REJOICED FOR GOD HAD MADE THEM REJOICE WITH GREAT JOY; THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALSO REJOICED

AND THE JOY OF JERUSALEM WAS HEARD FAR AWAY

ON THAT DAY MEN WERE APPOINTED OVER THE STOREROOMS THE CONTRIBUTIONS THE FIRSTFRUITS AND THE TITHES TO GATHER INTO THEM THE PORTIONS REQUIRED BY THE LAW FOR THE PRIESTS AND FOR THE LEVITES ACCORDING TO THE FIELDS OF THE TOWNS FOR JUDAH REJOICED OVER THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES WHO MINISTERED

AND THEY PERFORMED THE SERVICE OF THEIR GOD AND THE SERVICE OF PURIFICATION AS DID THE SINGERS AND THE GATEKEEPERS ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF DAVID AND HIS SON SOLOMON

FOR LONG AGO IN THE DAYS OF DAVID AND ASAPH THERE WERE DIRECTORS OF THE SINGERS AND THERE WERE SONGS OF PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING TO GOD

AND ALL ISRAEL IN THE DAYS OF ZERUBBABEL AND IN THE DAYS OF NEHEMIAH GAVE THE DAILY PORTIONS FOR THE SINGERS AND THE GATEKEEPERS; AND THEY SET APART THAT WHICH WAS FOR THE LEVITES; AND THE LEVITES SET APART THAT WHICH WAS FOR THE SONS OF AARON

ON THAT DAY THEY READ FROM THE BOOK OF MOSES IN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE

AND IN IT WAS FOUND WRITTEN THAT NO AMMONITE OR MOABITE SHOULD EVER ENTER THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD FOR THEY DID NOT MEET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WITH BREAD AND WATER BUT HIRED BALAAM AGAINST THEM TO CURSE THEMYET OUR GOD TURNED THE CURSE INTO A BLESSING

AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE HEARD THE LAW THEY SEPARATED FROM ISRAEL ALL THOSE OF FOREIGN DESCENT

NOW BEFORE THIS ELIASHIB THE PRIEST WHO WAS APPOINTED OVER THE CHAMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD AND WHO WAS RELATED TO TOBIAH PREPARED FOR TOBIAH A LARGE CHAMBER WHERE THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY PUT THE GRAIN OFFERING THE FRANKINCENSE THE VESSELS AND THE TITHES OF GRAIN WINE AND OIL WHICH WERE GIVEN BY COMMANDMENT TO THE LEVITES SINGERS AND GATEKEEPERS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PRIESTS

WHILE THIS WAS TAKING PLACE I WAS NOT IN JERUSALEM FOR IN THE THIRTYSECOND YEAR OF ARTAXERXES KING OF BABYLON I WENT TO THE KING

AND AFTER SOME TIME I ASKED LEAVE OF THE KING AND CAME TO JERUSALEM AND I THEN DISCOVERED THE EVIL THAT ELIASHIB HAD DONE FOR TOBIAH PREPARING FOR HIM A CHAMBER IN THE COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD

AND I WAS VERY ANGRY AND I THREW ALL THE HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE OF TOBIAH OUT OF THE CHAMBER

THEN I GAVE ORDERS AND THEY CLEANSED THE CHAMBERS AND I BROUGHT BACK THERE THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH THE GRAIN OFFERING AND THE FRANKINCENSE

I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THE PORTIONS OF THE LEVITES HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN TO THEM SO THAT THE LEVITES AND THE SINGERS WHO DID THE WORK HAD FLED EACH TO HIS FIELD

SO I CONFRONTED THE OFFICIALS AND SAID WHY IS THE HOUSE OF GOD FORSAKEN

 AND I GATHERED THEM TOGETHER AND SET THEM IN THEIR STATIONS

THEN ALL JUDAH BROUGHT THE TITHE OF THE GRAIN WINE AND OIL INTO THE STOREHOUSES

AND I APPOINTED AS TREASURERS OVER THE STOREHOUSES SHELEMIAH THE PRIEST ZADOK THE SCRIBE AND PEDAIAH OF THE LEVITES AND AS THEIR ASSISTANT HANAN THE SON OF ZACCUR SON OF MATTANIAH FOR THEY WERE CONSIDERED RELIABLE AND THEIR DUTY WAS TO DISTRIBUTE TO THEIR BROTHERS

REMEMBER ME O MY GOD CONCERNING THIS AND DO NOT WIPE OUT MY GOOD DEEDS THAT I HAVE DONE FOR THE HOUSE OF MY GOD AND FOR HIS SERVICE

IN THOSE DAYS I SAW IN JUDAH PEOPLE TREADING WINEPRESSES ON THE SABBATH AND BRINGING IN HEAPS OF GRAIN AND LOADING THEM ON DONKEYS AND ALSO WINE GRAPES FIGS AND ALL KINDS OF LOADS WHICH THEY BROUGHT INTO JERUSALEM ON THE SABBATH DAY

AND I WARNED THEM ON THE DAY WHEN THEY SOLD FOOD

TYRIANS ALSO WHO LIVED IN THE CITY BROUGHT IN FISH AND ALL KINDS OF GOODS AND SOLD THEM ON THE SABBATH TO THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH IN JERUSALEM ITSELF

THEN I CONFRONTED THE NOBLES OF JUDAH AND SAID TO THEM WHAT IS THIS EVIL THING THAT YOU ARE DOING PROFANING THE SABBATH DAY

DID NOT YOUR FATHERS ACT IN THIS WAY AND DID NOT OUR GOD BRING ALL THIS DISASTER ON US AND ON THIS CITY

NOW YOU ARE BRINGING MORE WRATH ON ISRAEL BY PROFANING THE SABBATH

 AS SOON AS IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK AT THE GATES OF JERUSALEM BEFORE THE SABBATH I COMMANDED THAT THE DOORS SHOULD BE SHUT AND GAVE ORDERS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE OPENED UNTIL AFTER THE SABBATH

AND I STATIONED SOME OF MY SERVANTS AT THE GATES THAT NO LOAD MIGHT BE BROUGHT IN ON THE SABBATH DAY

THEN THE MERCHANTS AND SELLERS OF ALL KINDS OF WARES LODGED OUTSIDE JERUSALEM ONCE OR TWICE

BUT I WARNED THEM AND SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU LODGE OUTSIDE THE WALL

IF YOU DO SO AGAIN I WILL LAY HANDS ON YOU

 FROM THAT TIME ON THEY DID NOT COME ON THE SABBATH

THEN I COMMANDED THE LEVITES THAT THEY SHOULD PURIFY THEMSELVES AND COME AND GUARD THE GATES TO KEEP THE SABBATH DAY HOLY

REMEMBER THIS ALSO IN MY FAVOR O MY GOD AND SPARE ME ACCORDING TO THE GREATNESS OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE

IN THOSE DAYS ALSO I SAW THE JEWS WHO HAD MARRIED WOMEN OF ASHDOD AMMON AND MOAB

AND HALF OF THEIR CHILDREN SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF ASHDOD AND THEY COULD NOT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH BUT THE LANGUAGE OF EACH PEOPLE

AND I CONFRONTED THEM AND CURSED THEM AND BEAT SOME OF THEM AND PULLED OUT THEIR HAIR

AND I MADE THEM TAKE OATH IN THE NAME OF GOD SAYING YOU SHALL NOT GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THEIR SONS OR TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS FOR YOUR SONS OR FOR YOURSELVES

DID NOT SOLOMON KING OF ISRAEL SIN ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH WOMEN

AMONG THE MANY NATIONS THERE WAS NO KING LIKE HIM AND HE WAS BELOVED BY HIS GOD AND GOD MADE HIM KING OVER ALL ISRAEL

NEVERTHELESS FOREIGN WOMEN MADE EVEN HIM TO SIN

SHALL WE THEN LISTEN TO YOU AND DO ALL THIS GREAT EVIL AND ACT TREACHEROUSLY AGAINST OUR GOD BY MARRYING FOREIGN WOMEN

 AND ONE OF THE SONS OF JEHOIADA THE SON OF ELIASHIB THE HIGH PRIEST WAS THE SONINLAW OF SANBALLAT THE HORONITE

THEREFORE I CHASED HIM FROM ME

REMEMBER THEM O MY GOD BECAUSE THEY HAVE DESECRATED THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE COVENANT OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE LEVITES

THUS I CLEANSED THEM FROM EVERYTHING FOREIGN AND I ESTABLISHED THE DUTIES OF THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES EACH IN HIS WORK; AND I PROVIDED FOR THE WOOD OFFERING AT APPOINTED TIMES AND FOR THE FIRSTFRUITS

REMEMBER ME O MY GOD FOR GOOD

JOHNIN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD AND THE WORD WAS GOD

HE WAS IN THE BEGINNING WITH GOD

ALL THINGS WERE MADE THROUGH HIM AND WITHOUT HIM WAS NOT ANY THING MADE THAT WAS MADE

IN HIM WAS LIFE AND THE LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MEN

THE LIGHT SHINES IN THE DARKNESS AND THE DARKNESS HAS NOT OVERCOME IT

THERE WAS A MAN SENT FROM GOD WHOSE NAME WAS JOHN

HE CAME AS A WITNESS TO BEAR WITNESS ABOUT THE LIGHT THAT ALL MIGHT BELIEVE THROUGH HIM

HE WAS NOT THE LIGHT BUT CAME TO BEAR WITNESS ABOUT THE LIGHT

THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH ENLIGHTENS EVERYONE WAS COMING INTO THE WORLD

HE WAS IN THE WORLD AND THE WORLD WAS MADE THROUGH HIM YET THE WORLD DID NOT KNOW HIM

HE CAME TO HIS OWN AND HIS OWN PEOPLE DID NOT RECEIVE HIM

BUT TO ALL WHO DID RECEIVE HIM WHO BELIEVED IN HIS NAME HE GAVE THE RIGHT TO BECOME CHILDREN OF GOD WHO WERE BORN NOT OF BLOOD NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN BUT OF GOD

AND THE WORD BECAME FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US AND WE HAVE SEEN HIS GLORY GLORY AS OF THE ONLY SON FROM THE FATHER FULL OF GRACE AND TRUTH

JOHN BORE WITNESS ABOUT HIM AND CRIED OUT THIS WAS HE OF WHOM I SAID 'HE WHO COMES AFTER ME RANKS BEFORE ME BECAUSE HE WAS BEFORE ME

' AND FROM HIS FULLNESS WE HAVE ALL RECEIVED GRACE UPON GRACE

FOR THE LAW WAS GIVEN THROUGH MOSES; GRACE AND TRUTH CAME THROUGH JESUS CHRIST

NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN GOD; THE ONLY GOD WHO IS AT THE FATHER'S SIDE HE HAS MADE HIM KNOWN

AND THIS IS THE TESTIMONY OF JOHN WHEN THE JEWS SENT PRIESTS AND LEVITES FROM JERUSALEM TO ASK HIM WHO ARE YOU

 HE CONFESSED AND DID NOT DENY BUT CONFESSED I AM NOT THE CHRIST

 AND THEY ASKED HIM WHAT THEN

ARE YOU ELIJAH

 HE SAID I AM NOT

ARE YOU THE PROPHET

 AND HE ANSWERED NO

 SO THEY SAID TO HIM WHO ARE YOU

WE NEED TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO THOSE WHO SENT US

WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT YOURSELF

 HE SAID I AM THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING OUT IN THE WILDERNESS 'MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD' AS THE PROPHET ISAIAH SAID

 NOW THEY HAD BEEN SENT FROM THE PHARISEES

 THEY ASKED HIM THEN WHY ARE YOU BAPTIZING IF YOU ARE NEITHER THE CHRIST NOR ELIJAH NOR THE PROPHET

 JOHN ANSWERED THEM I BAPTIZE WITH WATER BUT AMONG YOU STANDS ONE YOU DO NOT KNOW EVEN HE WHO COMES AFTER ME THE STRAP OF WHOSE SANDAL I AM NOT WORTHY TO UNTIE

 THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE IN BETHANY ACROSS THE JORDAN WHERE JOHN WAS BAPTIZING

THE NEXT DAY HE SAW JESUS COMING TOWARD HIM AND SAID BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD WHO TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD

THIS IS HE OF WHOM I SAID 'AFTER ME COMES A MAN WHO RANKS BEFORE ME BECAUSE HE WAS BEFORE ME

' I MYSELF DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE I CAME BAPTIZING WITH WATER THAT HE MIGHT BE REVEALED TO ISRAEL

 AND JOHN BORE WITNESS I SAW THE SPIRIT DESCEND FROM HEAVEN LIKE A DOVE AND IT REMAINED ON HIM

I MYSELF DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT HE WHO SENT ME TO BAPTIZE WITH WATER SAID TO ME 'HE ON WHOM YOU SEE THE SPIRIT DESCEND AND REMAIN THIS IS HE WHO BAPTIZES WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT

' AND I HAVE SEEN AND HAVE BORNE WITNESS THAT THIS IS THE SON OF GOD

 THE NEXT DAY AGAIN JOHN WAS STANDING WITH TWO OF HIS DISCIPLES AND HE LOOKED AT JESUS AS HE WALKED BY AND SAID BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD

 THE TWO DISCIPLES HEARD HIM SAY THIS AND THEY FOLLOWED JESUS

JESUS TURNED AND SAW THEM FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THEM WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM RABBI WHICH MEANS TEACHER WHERE ARE YOU STAYING

 HE SAID TO THEM COME AND YOU WILL SEE

 SO THEY CAME AND SAW WHERE HE WAS STAYING AND THEY STAYED WITH HIM THAT DAY FOR IT WAS ABOUT THE TENTH HOUR

ONE OF THE TWO WHO HEARD JOHN SPEAK AND FOLLOWED JESUS WAS ANDREW SIMON PETER'S BROTHER

HE FIRST FOUND HIS OWN BROTHER SIMON AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE FOUND THE MESSIAH WHICH MEANS CHRIST

HE BROUGHT HIM TO JESUS

JESUS LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID SO YOU ARE SIMON THE SON OF JOHN

YOU SHALL BE CALLED CEPHAS WHICH MEANS PETER 

THE NEXT DAY JESUS DECIDED TO GO TO GALILEE

HE FOUND PHILIP AND SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME

 NOW PHILIP WAS FROM BETHSAIDA THE CITY OF ANDREW AND PETER

PHILIP FOUND NATHANAEL AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE FOUND HIM OF WHOM MOSES IN THE LAW AND ALSO THE PROPHETS WROTE JESUS OF NAZARETH THE SON OF JOSEPH

 NATHANAEL SAID TO HIM CAN ANYTHING GOOD COME OUT OF NAZARETH

 PHILIP SAID TO HIM COME AND SEE

 JESUS SAW NATHANAEL COMING TOWARD HIM AND SAID OF HIM BEHOLD AN ISRAELITE INDEED IN WHOM THERE IS NO DECEIT

 NATHANAEL SAID TO HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW ME

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM BEFORE PHILIP CALLED YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNDER THE FIG TREE I SAW YOU

 NATHANAEL ANSWERED HIM RABBI YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD

YOU ARE THE KING OF ISRAEL

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM BECAUSE I SAID TO YOU 'I SAW YOU UNDER THE FIG TREE' DO YOU BELIEVE

YOU WILL SEE GREATER THINGS THAN THESE

 AND HE SAID TO HIM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU YOU WILL SEE HEAVEN OPENED AND THE ANGELS OF GOD ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON THE SON OF MAN

ON THE THIRD DAY THERE WAS A WEDDING AT CANA IN GALILEE AND THE MOTHER OF JESUS WAS THERE

JESUS ALSO WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING WITH HIS DISCIPLES

WHEN THE WINE RAN OUT THE MOTHER OF JESUS SAID TO HIM THEY HAVE NO WINE

 AND JESUS SAID TO HER WOMAN WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ME

MY HOUR HAS NOT YET COME

 HIS MOTHER SAID TO THE SERVANTS DO WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU

 NOW THERE WERE SIX STONE WATER JARS THERE FOR THE JEWISH RITES OF PURIFICATION EACH HOLDING TWENTY OR THIRTY GALLONS

JESUS SAID TO THE SERVANTS FILL THE JARS WITH WATER

 AND THEY FILLED THEM UP TO THE BRIM

AND HE SAID TO THEM NOW DRAW SOME OUT AND TAKE IT TO THE MASTER OF THE FEAST

 SO THEY TOOK IT

WHEN THE MASTER OF THE FEAST TASTED THE WATER NOW BECOME WINE AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM THOUGH THE SERVANTS WHO HAD DRAWN THE WATER KNEW THE MASTER OF THE FEAST CALLED THE BRIDEGROOM AND SAID TO HIM EVERYONE SERVES THE GOOD WINE FIRST AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE DRUNK FREELY THEN THE POOR WINE

BUT YOU HAVE KEPT THE GOOD WINE UNTIL NOW

 THIS THE FIRST OF HIS SIGNS JESUS DID AT CANA IN GALILEE AND MANIFESTED HIS GLORY

AND HIS DISCIPLES BELIEVED IN HIM

AFTER THIS HE WENT DOWN TO CAPERNAUM WITH HIS MOTHER AND HIS BROTHERS AND HIS DISCIPLES AND THEY STAYED THERE FOR A FEW DAYS

THE PASSOVER OF THE JEWS WAS AT HAND AND JESUS WENT UP TO JERUSALEM

IN THE TEMPLE HE FOUND THOSE WHO WERE SELLING OXEN AND SHEEP AND PIGEONS AND THE MONEYCHANGERS SITTING THERE

AND MAKING A WHIP OF CORDS HE DROVE THEM ALL OUT OF THE TEMPLE WITH THE SHEEP AND OXEN

AND HE POURED OUT THE COINS OF THE MONEYCHANGERS AND OVERTURNED THEIR TABLES

AND HE TOLD THOSE WHO SOLD THE PIGEONS TAKE THESE THINGS AWAY; DO NOT MAKE MY FATHER'S HOUSE A HOUSE OF TRADE

 HIS DISCIPLES REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS WRITTEN ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME

 SO THE JEWS SAID TO HIM WHAT SIGN DO YOU SHOW US FOR DOING THESE THINGS

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM DESTROY THIS TEMPLE AND IN THREE DAYS I WILL RAISE IT UP

 THE JEWS THEN SAID IT HAS TAKEN FORTYSIX YEARS TO BUILD THIS TEMPLE AND WILL YOU RAISE IT UP IN THREE DAYS

 BUT HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE TEMPLE OF HIS BODY

WHEN THEREFORE HE WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD HIS DISCIPLES REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD SAID THIS AND THEY BELIEVED THE SCRIPTURE AND THE WORD THAT JESUS HAD SPOKEN

NOW WHEN HE WAS IN JERUSALEM AT THE PASSOVER FEAST MANY BELIEVED IN HIS NAME WHEN THEY SAW THE SIGNS THAT HE WAS DOING

BUT JESUS ON HIS PART DID NOT ENTRUST HIMSELF TO THEM BECAUSE HE KNEW ALL PEOPLE AND NEEDED NO ONE TO BEAR WITNESS ABOUT MAN FOR HE HIMSELF KNEW WHAT WAS IN MAN

NOW THERE WAS A MAN OF THE PHARISEES NAMED NICODEMUS A RULER OF THE JEWS

THIS MAN CAME TO JESUS BY NIGHT AND SAID TO HIM RABBI WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A TEACHER COME FROM GOD FOR NO ONE CAN DO THESE SIGNS THAT YOU DO UNLESS GOD IS WITH HIM

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNLESS ONE IS BORN AGAIN HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM OF GOD

 NICODEMUS SAID TO HIM HOW CAN A MAN BE BORN WHEN HE IS OLD

CAN HE ENTER A SECOND TIME INTO HIS MOTHER'S WOMB AND BE BORN

 JESUS ANSWERED TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNLESS ONE IS BORN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT HE CANNOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD

THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE FLESH IS FLESH AND THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT IS SPIRIT

DO NOT MARVEL THAT I SAID TO YOU 'YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN

' THE WIND BLOWS WHERE IT WISHES AND YOU HEAR ITS SOUND BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM OR WHERE IT GOES

SO IT IS WITH EVERYONE WHO IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT

 NICODEMUS SAID TO HIM HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM ARE YOU THE TEACHER OF ISRAEL AND YET YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WE SPEAK OF WHAT WE KNOW AND BEAR WITNESS TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BUT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE OUR TESTIMONY

IF I HAVE TOLD YOU EARTHLY THINGS AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IF I TELL YOU HEAVENLY THINGS

NO ONE HAS ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN EXCEPT HE WHO DESCENDED FROM HEAVEN THE SON OF MAN

AND AS MOSES LIFTED UP THE SERPENT IN THE WILDERNESS SO MUST THE SON OF MAN BE LIFTED UP THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM MAY HAVE ETERNAL LIFE

FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE

FOR GOD DID NOT SEND HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD BUT IN ORDER THAT THE WORLD MIGHT BE SAVED THROUGH HIM

WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM IS NOT CONDEMNED BUT WHOEVER DOES NOT BELIEVE IS CONDEMNED ALREADY BECAUSE HE HAS NOT BELIEVED IN THE NAME OF THE ONLY SON OF GOD

AND THIS IS THE JUDGMENT THE LIGHT HAS COME INTO THE WORLD AND PEOPLE LOVED THE DARKNESS RATHER THAN THE LIGHT BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL

FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES WICKED THINGS HATES THE LIGHT AND DOES NOT COME TO THE LIGHT LEST HIS DEEDS SHOULD BE EXPOSED

BUT WHOEVER DOES WHAT IS TRUE COMES TO THE LIGHT SO THAT IT MAY BE CLEARLY SEEN THAT HIS DEEDS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN GOD

 AFTER THIS JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES WENT INTO THE JUDEAN COUNTRYSIDE AND HE REMAINED THERE WITH THEM AND WAS BAPTIZING

JOHN ALSO WAS BAPTIZING AT AENON NEAR SALIM BECAUSE WATER WAS PLENTIFUL THERE AND PEOPLE WERE COMING AND BEING BAPTIZED FOR JOHN HAD NOT YET BEEN PUT IN PRISON

NOW A DISCUSSION AROSE BETWEEN SOME OF JOHN'S DISCIPLES AND A JEW OVER PURIFICATION

AND THEY CAME TO JOHN AND SAID TO HIM RABBI HE WHO WAS WITH YOU ACROSS THE JORDAN TO WHOM YOU BORE WITNESSLOOK HE IS BAPTIZING AND ALL ARE GOING TO HIM

 JOHN ANSWERED A PERSON CANNOT RECEIVE EVEN ONE THING UNLESS IT IS GIVEN HIM FROM HEAVEN

YOU YOURSELVES BEAR ME WITNESS THAT I SAID 'I AM NOT THE CHRIST BUT I HAVE BEEN SENT BEFORE HIM

' THE ONE WHO HAS THE BRIDE IS THE BRIDEGROOM

THE FRIEND OF THE BRIDEGROOM WHO STANDS AND HEARS HIM REJOICES GREATLY AT THE BRIDEGROOM'S VOICE

THEREFORE THIS JOY OF MINE IS NOW COMPLETE

HE MUST INCREASE BUT I MUST DECREASE

 HE WHO COMES FROM ABOVE IS ABOVE ALL

HE WHO IS OF THE EARTH BELONGS TO THE EARTH AND SPEAKS IN AN EARTHLY WAY

HE WHO COMES FROM HEAVEN IS ABOVE ALL

HE BEARS WITNESS TO WHAT HE HAS SEEN AND HEARD YET NO ONE RECEIVES HIS TESTIMONY

WHOEVER RECEIVES HIS TESTIMONY SETS HIS SEAL TO THIS THAT GOD IS TRUE

FOR HE WHOM GOD HAS SENT UTTERS THE WORDS OF GOD FOR HE GIVES THE SPIRIT WITHOUT MEASURE

THE FATHER LOVES THE SON AND HAS GIVEN ALL THINGS INTO HIS HAND

WHOEVER BELIEVES IN THE SON HAS ETERNAL LIFE; WHOEVER DOES NOT OBEY THE SON SHALL NOT SEE LIFE BUT THE WRATH OF GOD REMAINS ON HIM

NOW WHEN JESUS LEARNED THAT THE PHARISEES HAD HEARD THAT JESUS WAS MAKING AND BAPTIZING MORE DISCIPLES THAN JOHN ALTHOUGH JESUS HIMSELF DID NOT BAPTIZE BUT ONLY HIS DISCIPLES HE LEFT JUDEA AND DEPARTED AGAIN FOR GALILEE

AND HE HAD TO PASS THROUGH SAMARIA

SO HE CAME TO A TOWN OF SAMARIA CALLED SYCHAR NEAR THE FIELD THAT JACOB HAD GIVEN TO HIS SON JOSEPH

JACOB'S WELL WAS THERE; SO JESUS WEARIED AS HE WAS FROM HIS JOURNEY WAS SITTING BESIDE THE WELL

IT WAS ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR

THERE CAME A WOMAN OF SAMARIA TO DRAW WATER

JESUS SAID TO HER GIVE ME A DRINK

 FOR HIS DISCIPLES HAD GONE AWAY INTO THE CITY TO BUY FOOD

 THE SAMARITAN WOMAN SAID TO HIM HOW IS IT THAT YOU A JEW ASK FOR A DRINK FROM ME A WOMAN OF SAMARIA

 FOR JEWS HAVE NO DEALINGS WITH SAMARITANS

 JESUS ANSWERED HER IF YOU KNEW THE GIFT OF GOD AND WHO IT IS THAT IS SAYING TO YOU 'GIVE ME A DRINK' YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU LIVING WATER

 THE WOMAN SAID TO HIM SIR YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DRAW WATER WITH AND THE WELL IS DEEP

WHERE DO YOU GET THAT LIVING WATER

ARE YOU GREATER THAN OUR FATHER JACOB

HE GAVE US THE WELL AND DRANK FROM IT HIMSELF AS DID HIS SONS AND HIS LIVESTOCK

 JESUS SAID TO HER EVERYONE WHO DRINKS OF THIS WATER WILL BE THIRSTY AGAIN BUT WHOEVER DRINKS OF THE WATER THAT I WILL GIVE HIM WILL NEVER BE THIRSTY FOREVER

THE WATER THAT I WILL GIVE HIM WILL BECOME IN HIM A SPRING OF WATER WELLING UP TO ETERNAL LIFE

 THE WOMAN SAID TO HIM SIR GIVE ME THIS WATER SO THAT I WILL NOT BE THIRSTY OR HAVE TO COME HERE TO DRAW WATER

 JESUS SAID TO HER GO CALL YOUR HUSBAND AND COME HERE

 THE WOMAN ANSWERED HIM I HAVE NO HUSBAND

 JESUS SAID TO HER YOU ARE RIGHT IN SAYING 'I HAVE NO HUSBAND'; FOR YOU HAVE HAD FIVE HUSBANDS AND THE ONE YOU NOW HAVE IS NOT YOUR HUSBAND

WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE

 THE WOMAN SAID TO HIM SIR I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET

OUR FATHERS WORSHIPED ON THIS MOUNTAIN BUT YOU SAY THAT IN JERUSALEM IS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE OUGHT TO WORSHIP

 JESUS SAID TO HER WOMAN BELIEVE ME THE HOUR IS COMING WHEN NEITHER ON THIS MOUNTAIN NOR IN JERUSALEM WILL YOU WORSHIP THE FATHER

YOU WORSHIP WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW; WE WORSHIP WHAT WE KNOW FOR SALVATION IS FROM THE JEWS

BUT THE HOUR IS COMING AND IS NOW HERE WHEN THE TRUE WORSHIPERS WILL WORSHIP THE FATHER IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH FOR THE FATHER IS SEEKING SUCH PEOPLE TO WORSHIP HIM

GOD IS SPIRIT AND THOSE WHO WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH

 THE WOMAN SAID TO HIM I KNOW THAT MESSIAH IS COMING HE WHO IS CALLED CHRIST

WHEN HE COMES HE WILL TELL US ALL THINGS

 JESUS SAID TO HER I WHO SPEAK TO YOU AM HE

 JUST THEN HIS DISCIPLES CAME BACK

THEY MARVELED THAT HE WAS TALKING WITH A WOMAN BUT NO ONE SAID WHAT DO YOU SEEK

 OR WHY ARE YOU TALKING WITH HER

 SO THE WOMAN LEFT HER WATER JAR AND WENT AWAY INTO TOWN AND SAID TO THE PEOPLE COME SEE A MAN WHO TOLD ME ALL THAT I EVER DID

CAN THIS BE THE CHRIST

 THEY WENT OUT OF THE TOWN AND WERE COMING TO HIM

MEANWHILE THE DISCIPLES WERE URGING HIM SAYING RABBI EAT

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM I HAVE FOOD TO EAT THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT

 SO THE DISCIPLES SAID TO ONE ANOTHER HAS ANYONE BROUGHT HIM SOMETHING TO EAT

 JESUS SAID TO THEM MY FOOD IS TO DO THE WILL OF HIM WHO SENT ME AND TO ACCOMPLISH HIS WORK

DO YOU NOT SAY 'THERE ARE YET FOUR MONTHS THEN COMES THE HARVEST'

LOOK I TELL YOU LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE WHITE FOR HARVEST

ALREADY THE ONE WHO REAPS IS RECEIVING WAGES AND GATHERING FRUIT FOR ETERNAL LIFE SO THAT SOWER AND REAPER MAY REJOICE TOGETHER

FOR HERE THE SAYING HOLDS TRUE 'ONE SOWS AND ANOTHER REAPS

' I SENT YOU TO REAP THAT FOR WHICH YOU DID NOT LABOR

OTHERS HAVE LABORED AND YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO THEIR LABOR

 MANY SAMARITANS FROM THAT TOWN BELIEVED IN HIM BECAUSE OF THE WOMAN'S TESTIMONY HE TOLD ME ALL THAT I EVER DID

 SO WHEN THE SAMARITANS CAME TO HIM THEY ASKED HIM TO STAY WITH THEM AND HE STAYED THERE TWO DAYS

AND MANY MORE BELIEVED BECAUSE OF HIS WORD

THEY SAID TO THE WOMAN IT IS NO LONGER BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID THAT WE BELIEVE FOR WE HAVE HEARD FOR OURSELVES AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS INDEED THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD

 AFTER THE TWO DAYS HE DEPARTED FOR GALILEE

FOR JESUS HIMSELF HAD TESTIFIED THAT A PROPHET HAS NO HONOR IN HIS OWN HOMETOWN

 SO WHEN HE CAME TO GALILEE THE GALILEANS WELCOMED HIM HAVING SEEN ALL THAT HE HAD DONE IN JERUSALEM AT THE FEAST

FOR THEY TOO HAD GONE TO THE FEAST

SO HE CAME AGAIN TO CANA IN GALILEE WHERE HE HAD MADE THE WATER WINE

AND AT CAPERNAUM THERE WAS AN OFFICIAL WHOSE SON WAS ILL

WHEN THIS MAN HEARD THAT JESUS HAD COME FROM JUDEA TO GALILEE HE WENT TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO COME DOWN AND HEAL HIS SON FOR HE WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH

SO JESUS SAID TO HIM UNLESS YOU SEE SIGNS AND WONDERS YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE

 THE OFFICIAL SAID TO HIM SIR COME DOWN BEFORE MY CHILD DIES

 JESUS SAID TO HIM GO; YOUR SON WILL LIVE

 THE MAN BELIEVED THE WORD THAT JESUS SPOKE TO HIM AND WENT ON HIS WAY

AS HE WAS GOING DOWN HIS SERVANTS MET HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT HIS SON WAS RECOVERING

SO HE ASKED THEM THE HOUR WHEN HE BEGAN TO GET BETTER AND THEY SAID TO HIM YESTERDAY AT THE SEVENTH HOUR THE FEVER LEFT HIM

 THE FATHER KNEW THAT WAS THE HOUR WHEN JESUS HAD SAID TO HIM YOUR SON WILL LIVE

 AND HE HIMSELF BELIEVED AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD

THIS WAS NOW THE SECOND SIGN THAT JESUS DID WHEN HE HAD COME FROM JUDEA TO GALILEE

AFTER THIS THERE WAS A FEAST OF THE JEWS AND JESUS WENT UP TO JERUSALEM

NOW THERE IS IN JERUSALEM BY THE SHEEP GATE A POOL IN ARAMAIC CALLED BETHESDA WHICH HAS FIVE ROOFED COLONNADES

IN THESE LAY A MULTITUDE OF INVALIDSBLIND LAME AND PARALYZED

SEE FOOTNOTE ONE MAN WAS THERE WHO HAD BEEN AN INVALID FOR THIRTYEIGHT YEARS

WHEN JESUS SAW HIM LYING THERE AND KNEW THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE A LONG TIME HE SAID TO HIM DO YOU WANT TO BE HEALED

 THE SICK MAN ANSWERED HIM SIR I HAVE NO ONE TO PUT ME INTO THE POOL WHEN THE WATER IS STIRRED UP AND WHILE I AM GOING ANOTHER STEPS DOWN BEFORE ME

 JESUS SAID TO HIM GET UP TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK

 AND AT ONCE THE MAN WAS HEALED AND HE TOOK UP HIS BED AND WALKED

NOW THAT DAY WAS THE SABBATH

SO THE JEWS SAID TO THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HEALED IT IS THE SABBATH AND IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR YOU TO TAKE UP YOUR BED

 BUT HE ANSWERED THEM THE MAN WHO HEALED ME THAT MAN SAID TO ME 'TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK

' THEY ASKED HIM WHO IS THE MAN WHO SAID TO YOU 'TAKE UP YOUR BED AND WALK'

 NOW THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HEALED DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS FOR JESUS HAD WITHDRAWN AS THERE WAS A CROWD IN THE PLACE

AFTERWARD JESUS FOUND HIM IN THE TEMPLE AND SAID TO HIM SEE YOU ARE WELL

SIN NO MORE THAT NOTHING WORSE MAY HAPPEN TO YOU

 THE MAN WENT AWAY AND TOLD THE JEWS THAT IT WAS JESUS WHO HAD HEALED HIM

AND THIS WAS WHY THE JEWS WERE PERSECUTING JESUS BECAUSE HE WAS DOING THESE THINGS ON THE SABBATH

BUT JESUS ANSWERED THEM MY FATHER IS WORKING UNTIL NOW AND I AM WORKING

 THIS WAS WHY THE JEWS WERE SEEKING ALL THE MORE TO KILL HIM BECAUSE NOT ONLY WAS HE BREAKING THE SABBATH BUT HE WAS EVEN CALLING GOD HIS OWN FATHER MAKING HIMSELF EQUAL WITH GOD

SO JESUS SAID TO THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU THE SON CAN DO NOTHING OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT ONLY WHAT HE SEES THE FATHER DOING

FOR WHATEVER THE FATHER DOES THAT THE SON DOES LIKEWISE

FOR THE FATHER LOVES THE SON AND SHOWS HIM ALL THAT HE HIMSELF IS DOING

AND GREATER WORKS THAN THESE WILL HE SHOW HIM SO THAT YOU MAY MARVEL

FOR AS THE FATHER RAISES THE DEAD AND GIVES THEM LIFE SO ALSO THE SON GIVES LIFE TO WHOM HE WILL

THE FATHER JUDGES NO ONE BUT HAS GIVEN ALL JUDGMENT TO THE SON THAT ALL MAY HONOR THE SON JUST AS THEY HONOR THE FATHER

WHOEVER DOES NOT HONOR THE SON DOES NOT HONOR THE FATHER WHO SENT HIM

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER HEARS MY WORD AND BELIEVES HIM WHO SENT ME HAS ETERNAL LIFE

HE DOES NOT COME INTO JUDGMENT BUT HAS PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU AN HOUR IS COMING AND IS NOW HERE WHEN THE DEAD WILL HEAR THE VOICE OF THE SON OF GOD AND THOSE WHO HEAR WILL LIVE

FOR AS THE FATHER HAS LIFE IN HIMSELF SO HE HAS GRANTED THE SON ALSO TO HAVE LIFE IN HIMSELF

AND HE HAS GIVEN HIM AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE JUDGMENT BECAUSE HE IS THE SON OF MAN

DO NOT MARVEL AT THIS FOR AN HOUR IS COMING WHEN ALL WHO ARE IN THE TOMBS WILL HEAR HIS VOICE AND COME OUT THOSE WHO HAVE DONE GOOD TO THE RESURRECTION OF LIFE AND THOSE WHO HAVE DONE EVIL TO THE RESURRECTION OF JUDGMENT

I CAN DO NOTHING ON MY OWN

AS I HEAR I JUDGE AND MY JUDGMENT IS JUST BECAUSE I SEEK NOT MY OWN WILL BUT THE WILL OF HIM WHO SENT ME

IF I ALONE BEAR WITNESS ABOUT MYSELF MY TESTIMONY IS NOT DEEMED TRUE

THERE IS ANOTHER WHO BEARS WITNESS ABOUT ME AND I KNOW THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT HE BEARS ABOUT ME IS TRUE

YOU SENT TO JOHN AND HE HAS BORNE WITNESS TO THE TRUTH

NOT THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT I RECEIVE IS FROM MAN BUT I SAY THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU MAY BE SAVED

HE WAS A BURNING AND SHINING LAMP AND YOU WERE WILLING TO REJOICE FOR A WHILE IN HIS LIGHT

BUT THE TESTIMONY THAT I HAVE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF JOHN

FOR THE WORKS THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN ME TO ACCOMPLISH THE VERY WORKS THAT I AM DOING BEAR WITNESS ABOUT ME THAT THE FATHER HAS SENT ME

AND THE FATHER WHO SENT ME HAS HIMSELF BORNE WITNESS ABOUT ME

HIS VOICE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD HIS FORM YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN AND YOU DO NOT HAVE HIS WORD ABIDING IN YOU FOR YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THE ONE WHOM HE HAS SENT

YOU SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IN THEM YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE; AND IT IS THEY THAT BEAR WITNESS ABOUT ME YET YOU REFUSE TO COME TO ME THAT YOU MAY HAVE LIFE

I DO NOT RECEIVE GLORY FROM PEOPLE

BUT I KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE LOVE OF GOD WITHIN YOU

I HAVE COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME AND YOU DO NOT RECEIVE ME

IF ANOTHER COMES IN HIS OWN NAME YOU WILL RECEIVE HIM

HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE WHEN YOU RECEIVE GLORY FROM ONE ANOTHER AND DO NOT SEEK THE GLORY THAT COMES FROM THE ONLY GOD

DO NOT THINK THAT I WILL ACCUSE YOU TO THE FATHER

THERE IS ONE WHO ACCUSES YOU MOSES ON WHOM YOU HAVE SET YOUR HOPE

IF YOU BELIEVED MOSES YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME; FOR HE WROTE OF ME

BUT IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE HIS WRITINGS HOW WILL YOU BELIEVE MY WORDS

AFTER THIS JESUS WENT AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA OF GALILEE WHICH IS THE SEA OF TIBERIAS

AND A LARGE CROWD WAS FOLLOWING HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW THE SIGNS THAT HE WAS DOING ON THE SICK

JESUS WENT UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THERE HE SAT DOWN WITH HIS DISCIPLES

NOW THE PASSOVER THE FEAST OF THE JEWS WAS AT HAND

LIFTING UP HIS EYES THEN AND SEEING THAT A LARGE CROWD WAS COMING TOWARD HIM JESUS SAID TO PHILIP WHERE ARE WE TO BUY BREAD SO THAT THESE PEOPLE MAY EAT

 HE SAID THIS TO TEST HIM FOR HE HIMSELF KNEW WHAT HE WOULD DO

PHILIP ANSWERED HIM TWO HUNDRED DENARII WOULD NOT BUY ENOUGH BREAD FOR EACH OF THEM TO GET A LITTLE

 ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES ANDREW SIMON PETER'S BROTHER SAID TO HIM THERE IS A BOY HERE WHO HAS FIVE BARLEY LOAVES AND TWO FISH BUT WHAT ARE THEY FOR SO MANY

 JESUS SAID HAVE THE PEOPLE SIT DOWN

 NOW THERE WAS MUCH GRASS IN THE PLACE

SO THE MEN SAT DOWN ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND IN NUMBER

JESUS THEN TOOK THE LOAVES AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE DISTRIBUTED THEM TO THOSE WHO WERE SEATED

SO ALSO THE FISH AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED

AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR FILL HE TOLD HIS DISCIPLES GATHER UP THE LEFTOVER FRAGMENTS THAT NOTHING MAY BE LOST

 SO THEY GATHERED THEM UP AND FILLED TWELVE BASKETS WITH FRAGMENTS FROM THE FIVE BARLEY LOAVES LEFT BY THOSE WHO HAD EATEN

WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW THE SIGN THAT HE HAD DONE THEY SAID THIS IS INDEED THE PROPHET WHO IS TO COME INTO THE WORLD

 PERCEIVING THEN THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO COME AND TAKE HIM BY FORCE TO MAKE HIM KING JESUS WITHDREW AGAIN TO THE MOUNTAIN BY HIMSELF

WHEN EVENING CAME HIS DISCIPLES WENT DOWN TO THE SEA GOT INTO A BOAT AND STARTED ACROSS THE SEA TO CAPERNAUM

IT WAS NOW DARK AND JESUS HAD NOT YET COME TO THEM

THE SEA BECAME ROUGH BECAUSE A STRONG WIND WAS BLOWING

WHEN THEY HAD ROWED ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MILES THEY SAW JESUS WALKING ON THE SEA AND COMING NEAR THE BOAT AND THEY WERE FRIGHTENED

BUT HE SAID TO THEM IT IS I; DO NOT BE AFRAID

 THEN THEY WERE GLAD TO TAKE HIM INTO THE BOAT AND IMMEDIATELY THE BOAT WAS AT THE LAND TO WHICH THEY WERE GOING

ON THE NEXT DAY THE CROWD THAT REMAINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA SAW THAT THERE HAD BEEN ONLY ONE BOAT THERE AND THAT JESUS HAD NOT ENTERED THE BOAT WITH HIS DISCIPLES BUT THAT HIS DISCIPLES HAD GONE AWAY ALONE

OTHER BOATS FROM TIBERIAS CAME NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD EATEN THE BREAD AFTER THE LORD HAD GIVEN THANKS

SO WHEN THE CROWD SAW THAT JESUS WAS NOT THERE NOR HIS DISCIPLES THEY THEMSELVES GOT INTO THE BOATS AND WENT TO CAPERNAUM SEEKING JESUS

WHEN THEY FOUND HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA THEY SAID TO HIM RABBI WHEN DID YOU COME HERE

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU YOU ARE SEEKING ME NOT BECAUSE YOU SAW SIGNS BUT BECAUSE YOU ATE YOUR FILL OF THE LOAVES

DO NOT LABOR FOR THE FOOD THAT PERISHES BUT FOR THE FOOD THAT ENDURES TO ETERNAL LIFE WHICH THE SON OF MAN WILL GIVE TO YOU

FOR ON HIM GOD THE FATHER HAS SET HIS SEAL

 THEN THEY SAID TO HIM WHAT MUST WE DO TO BE DOING THE WORKS OF GOD

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM THIS IS THE WORK OF GOD THAT YOU BELIEVE IN HIM WHOM HE HAS SENT

 SO THEY SAID TO HIM THEN WHAT SIGN DO YOU DO THAT WE MAY SEE AND BELIEVE YOU

WHAT WORK DO YOU PERFORM

OUR FATHERS ATE THE MANNA IN THE WILDERNESS; AS IT IS WRITTEN 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN TO EAT

' JESUS THEN SAID TO THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU IT WAS NOT MOSES WHO GAVE YOU THE BREAD FROM HEAVEN BUT MY FATHER GIVES YOU THE TRUE BREAD FROM HEAVEN

FOR THE BREAD OF GOD IS HE WHO COMES DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND GIVES LIFE TO THE WORLD

 THEY SAID TO HIM SIR GIVE US THIS BREAD ALWAYS

 JESUS SAID TO THEM I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE; WHOEVER COMES TO ME SHALL NOT HUNGER AND WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME SHALL NEVER THIRST

BUT I SAID TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ME AND YET DO NOT BELIEVE

ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVES ME WILL COME TO ME AND WHOEVER COMES TO ME I WILL NEVER CAST OUT

FOR I HAVE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN NOT TO DO MY OWN WILL BUT THE WILL OF HIM WHO SENT ME

AND THIS IS THE WILL OF HIM WHO SENT ME THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE HAS GIVEN ME BUT RAISE IT UP ON THE LAST DAY

FOR THIS IS THE WILL OF MY FATHER THAT EVERYONE WHO LOOKS ON THE SON AND BELIEVES IN HIM SHOULD HAVE ETERNAL LIFE AND I WILL RAISE HIM UP ON THE LAST DAY

 SO THE JEWS GRUMBLED ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE SAID I AM THE BREAD THAT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN

 THEY SAID IS NOT THIS JESUS THE SON OF JOSEPH WHOSE FATHER AND MOTHER WE KNOW

HOW DOES HE NOW SAY 'I HAVE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN'

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM DO NOT GRUMBLE AMONG YOURSELVES

NO ONE CAN COME TO ME UNLESS THE FATHER WHO SENT ME DRAWS HIM

AND I WILL RAISE HIM UP ON THE LAST DAY

IT IS WRITTEN IN THE PROPHETS 'AND THEY WILL ALL BE TAUGHT BY GOD

' EVERYONE WHO HAS HEARD AND LEARNED FROM THE FATHER COMES TO ME NOT THAT ANYONE HAS SEEN THE FATHER EXCEPT HE WHO IS FROM GOD; HE HAS SEEN THE FATHER

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER BELIEVES HAS ETERNAL LIFE

I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE

YOUR FATHERS ATE THE MANNA IN THE WILDERNESS AND THEY DIED

THIS IS THE BREAD THAT COMES DOWN FROM HEAVEN SO THAT ONE MAY EAT OF IT AND NOT DIE

I AM THE LIVING BREAD THAT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN

IF ANYONE EATS OF THIS BREAD HE WILL LIVE FOREVER

AND THE BREAD THAT I WILL GIVE FOR THE LIFE OF THE WORLD IS MY FLESH

 THE JEWS THEN DISPUTED AMONG THEMSELVES SAYING HOW CAN THIS MAN GIVE US HIS FLESH TO EAT

 SO JESUS SAID TO THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNLESS YOU EAT THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN AND DRINK HIS BLOOD YOU HAVE NO LIFE IN YOU

WHOEVER FEEDS ON MY FLESH AND DRINKS MY BLOOD HAS ETERNAL LIFE AND I WILL RAISE HIM UP ON THE LAST DAY

FOR MY FLESH IS TRUE FOOD AND MY BLOOD IS TRUE DRINK

WHOEVER FEEDS ON MY FLESH AND DRINKS MY BLOOD ABIDES IN ME AND I IN HIM

AS THE LIVING FATHER SENT ME AND I LIVE BECAUSE OF THE FATHER SO WHOEVER FEEDS ON ME HE ALSO WILL LIVE BECAUSE OF ME

THIS IS THE BREAD THAT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN NOT AS THE FATHERS ATE AND DIED

WHOEVER FEEDS ON THIS BREAD WILL LIVE FOREVER

 JESUS SAID THESE THINGS IN THE SYNAGOGUE AS HE TAUGHT AT CAPERNAUM

WHEN MANY OF HIS DISCIPLES HEARD IT THEY SAID THIS IS A HARD SAYING; WHO CAN LISTEN TO IT

 BUT JESUS KNOWING IN HIMSELF THAT HIS DISCIPLES WERE GRUMBLING ABOUT THIS SAID TO THEM DO YOU TAKE OFFENSE AT THIS

THEN WHAT IF YOU WERE TO SEE THE SON OF MAN ASCENDING TO WHERE HE WAS BEFORE

IT IS THE SPIRIT WHO GIVES LIFE; THE FLESH IS OF NO AVAIL

THE WORDS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU ARE SPIRIT AND LIFE

BUT THERE ARE SOME OF YOU WHO DO NOT BELIEVE

 FOR JESUS KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING WHO THOSE WERE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE AND WHO IT WAS WHO WOULD BETRAY HIM

 AND HE SAID THIS IS WHY I TOLD YOU THAT NO ONE CAN COME TO ME UNLESS IT IS GRANTED HIM BY THE FATHER

 AFTER THIS MANY OF HIS DISCIPLES TURNED BACK AND NO LONGER WALKED WITH HIM

SO JESUS SAID TO THE TWELVE DO YOU WANT TO GO AWAY AS WELL

 SIMON PETER ANSWERED HIM LORD TO WHOM SHALL WE GO

YOU HAVE THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE AND WE HAVE BELIEVED AND HAVE COME TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE HOLY ONE OF GOD

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM DID I NOT CHOOSE YOU THE TWELVE

AND YET ONE OF YOU IS A DEVIL

 HE SPOKE OF JUDAS THE SON OF SIMON ISCARIOT FOR HE ONE OF THE TWELVE WAS GOING TO BETRAY HIM

AFTER THIS JESUS WENT ABOUT IN GALILEE

HE WOULD NOT GO ABOUT IN JUDEA BECAUSE THE JEWS WERE SEEKING TO KILL HIM

NOW THE JEWS' FEAST OF BOOTHS WAS AT HAND

SO HIS BROTHERS SAID TO HIM LEAVE HERE AND GO TO JUDEA THAT YOUR DISCIPLES ALSO MAY SEE THE WORKS YOU ARE DOING

FOR NO ONE WORKS IN SECRET IF HE SEEKS TO BE KNOWN OPENLY

IF YOU DO THESE THINGS SHOW YOURSELF TO THE WORLD

 FOR NOT EVEN HIS BROTHERS BELIEVED IN HIM

JESUS SAID TO THEM MY TIME HAS NOT YET COME BUT YOUR TIME IS ALWAYS HERE

THE WORLD CANNOT HATE YOU BUT IT HATES ME BECAUSE I TESTIFY ABOUT IT THAT ITS WORKS ARE EVIL

YOU GO UP TO THE FEAST

I AM NOT GOING UP TO THIS FEAST FOR MY TIME HAS NOT YET FULLY COME

 AFTER SAYING THIS HE REMAINED IN GALILEE

BUT AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD GONE UP TO THE FEAST THEN HE ALSO WENT UP NOT PUBLICLY BUT IN PRIVATE

THE JEWS WERE LOOKING FOR HIM AT THE FEAST AND SAYING WHERE IS HE

 AND THERE WAS MUCH MUTTERING ABOUT HIM AMONG THE PEOPLE

WHILE SOME SAID HE IS A GOOD MAN OTHERS SAID NO HE IS LEADING THE PEOPLE ASTRAY

 YET FOR FEAR OF THE JEWS NO ONE SPOKE OPENLY OF HIM

ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE FEAST JESUS WENT UP INTO THE TEMPLE AND BEGAN TEACHING

THE JEWS THEREFORE MARVELED SAYING HOW IS IT THAT THIS MAN HAS LEARNING WHEN HE HAS NEVER STUDIED

 SO JESUS ANSWERED THEM MY TEACHING IS NOT MINE BUT HIS WHO SENT ME

IF ANYONE'S WILL IS TO DO GOD'S WILL HE WILL KNOW WHETHER THE TEACHING IS FROM GOD OR WHETHER I AM SPEAKING ON MY OWN AUTHORITY

THE ONE WHO SPEAKS ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY SEEKS HIS OWN GLORY BUT THE ONE WHO SEEKS THE GLORY OF HIM WHO SENT HIM IS TRUE AND IN HIM THERE IS NO FALSEHOOD

HAS NOT MOSES GIVEN YOU THE LAW

YET NONE OF YOU KEEPS THE LAW

WHY DO YOU SEEK TO KILL ME

 THE CROWD ANSWERED YOU HAVE A DEMON

WHO IS SEEKING TO KILL YOU

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM I DID ONE DEED AND YOU ALL MARVEL AT IT

MOSES GAVE YOU CIRCUMCISION NOT THAT IT IS FROM MOSES BUT FROM THE FATHERS AND YOU CIRCUMCISE A MAN ON THE SABBATH

IF ON THE SABBATH A MAN RECEIVES CIRCUMCISION SO THAT THE LAW OF MOSES MAY NOT BE BROKEN ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE ON THE SABBATH I MADE A MAN'S WHOLE BODY WELL

DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES BUT JUDGE WITH RIGHT JUDGMENT

 SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THEREFORE SAID IS NOT THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY SEEK TO KILL

AND HERE HE IS SPEAKING OPENLY AND THEY SAY NOTHING TO HIM

CAN IT BE THAT THE AUTHORITIES REALLY KNOW THAT THIS IS THE CHRIST

BUT WE KNOW WHERE THIS MAN COMES FROM AND WHEN THE CHRIST APPEARS NO ONE WILL KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM

 SO JESUS PROCLAIMED AS HE TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE YOU KNOW ME AND YOU KNOW WHERE I COME FROM

BUT I HAVE NOT COME OF MY OWN ACCORD

HE WHO SENT ME IS TRUE AND HIM YOU DO NOT KNOW

I KNOW HIM FOR I COME FROM HIM AND HE SENT ME

 SO THEY WERE SEEKING TO ARREST HIM BUT NO ONE LAID A HAND ON HIM BECAUSE HIS HOUR HAD NOT YET COME

YET MANY OF THE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN HIM

THEY SAID WHEN THE CHRIST APPEARS WILL HE DO MORE SIGNS THAN THIS MAN HAS DONE

 THE PHARISEES HEARD THE CROWD MUTTERING THESE THINGS ABOUT HIM AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND PHARISEES SENT OFFICERS TO ARREST HIM

JESUS THEN SAID I WILL BE WITH YOU A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN I AM GOING TO HIM WHO SENT ME

YOU WILL SEEK ME AND YOU WILL NOT FIND ME

WHERE I AM YOU CANNOT COME

 THE JEWS SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHERE DOES THIS MAN INTEND TO GO THAT WE WILL NOT FIND HIM

DOES HE INTEND TO GO TO THE DISPERSION AMONG THE GREEKS AND TEACH THE GREEKS

WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY SAYING 'YOU WILL SEEK ME AND YOU WILL NOT FIND ME' AND 'WHERE I AM YOU CANNOT COME'

 ON THE LAST DAY OF THE FEAST THE GREAT DAY JESUS STOOD UP AND CRIED OUT IF ANYONE THIRSTS LET HIM COME TO ME AND DRINK

WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME AS THE SCRIPTURE HAS SAID 'OUT OF HIS HEART WILL FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATER

' NOW THIS HE SAID ABOUT THE SPIRIT WHOM THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN HIM WERE TO RECEIVE FOR AS YET THE SPIRIT HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN BECAUSE JESUS WAS NOT YET GLORIFIED

WHEN THEY HEARD THESE WORDS SOME OF THE PEOPLE SAID THIS REALLY IS THE PROPHET

 OTHERS SAID THIS IS THE CHRIST

 BUT SOME SAID IS THE CHRIST TO COME FROM GALILEE

HAS NOT THE SCRIPTURE SAID THAT THE CHRIST COMES FROM THE OFFSPRING OF DAVID AND COMES FROM BETHLEHEM THE VILLAGE WHERE DAVID WAS

 SO THERE WAS A DIVISION AMONG THE PEOPLE OVER HIM

SOME OF THEM WANTED TO ARREST HIM BUT NO ONE LAID HANDS ON HIM

THE OFFICERS THEN CAME TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND PHARISEES WHO SAID TO THEM WHY DID YOU NOT BRING HIM

 THE OFFICERS ANSWERED NO ONE EVER SPOKE LIKE THIS MAN

 THE PHARISEES ANSWERED THEM HAVE YOU ALSO BEEN DECEIVED

HAVE ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES OR THE PHARISEES BELIEVED IN HIM

BUT THIS CROWD THAT DOES NOT KNOW THE LAW IS ACCURSED

 NICODEMUS WHO HAD GONE TO HIM BEFORE AND WHO WAS ONE OF THEM SAID TO THEM DOES OUR LAW JUDGE A MAN WITHOUT FIRST GIVING HIM A HEARING AND LEARNING WHAT HE DOES

 THEY REPLIED ARE YOU FROM GALILEE TOO

SEARCH AND SEE THAT NO PROPHET ARISES FROM GALILEE

 [THE EARLIEST MANUSCRIPTS DO NOT INCLUDE JOHN ] [[THEY WENT EACH TO HIS OWN HOUSEBUT JESUS WENT TO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES

EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME AGAIN TO THE TEMPLE

ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO HIM AND HE SAT DOWN AND TAUGHT THEM

THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES BROUGHT A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN ADULTERY AND PLACING HER IN THE MIDST THEY SAID TO HIM TEACHER THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF ADULTERY

NOW IN THE LAW MOSES COMMANDED US TO STONE SUCH WOMEN

SO WHAT DO YOU SAY

 THIS THEY SAID TO TEST HIM THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME CHARGE TO BRING AGAINST HIM

JESUS BENT DOWN AND WROTE WITH HIS FINGER ON THE GROUND

AND AS THEY CONTINUED TO ASK HIM HE STOOD UP AND SAID TO THEM LET HIM WHO IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU BE THE FIRST TO THROW A STONE AT HER

 AND ONCE MORE HE BENT DOWN AND WROTE ON THE GROUND

BUT WHEN THEY HEARD IT THEY WENT AWAY ONE BY ONE BEGINNING WITH THE OLDER ONES AND JESUS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE WOMAN STANDING BEFORE HIM

JESUS STOOD UP AND SAID TO HER WOMAN WHERE ARE THEY

HAS NO ONE CONDEMNED YOU

 SHE SAID NO ONE LORD

 AND JESUS SAID NEITHER DO I CONDEMN YOU; GO AND FROM NOW ON SIN NO MORE

]] AGAIN JESUS SPOKE TO THEM SAYING I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

WHOEVER FOLLOWS ME WILL NOT WALK IN DARKNESS BUT WILL HAVE THE LIGHT OF LIFE

 SO THE PHARISEES SAID TO HIM YOU ARE BEARING WITNESS ABOUT YOURSELF; YOUR TESTIMONY IS NOT TRUE

 JESUS ANSWERED EVEN IF I DO BEAR WITNESS ABOUT MYSELF MY TESTIMONY IS TRUE FOR I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM AND WHERE I AM GOING BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE I COME FROM OR WHERE I AM GOING

YOU JUDGE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH; I JUDGE NO ONE

YET EVEN IF I DO JUDGE MY JUDGMENT IS TRUE FOR IT IS NOT I ALONE WHO JUDGE BUT I AND THE FATHER WHO SENT ME

IN YOUR LAW IT IS WRITTEN THAT THE TESTIMONY OF TWO MEN IS TRUE

I AM THE ONE WHO BEARS WITNESS ABOUT MYSELF AND THE FATHER WHO SENT ME BEARS WITNESS ABOUT ME

 THEY SAID TO HIM THEREFORE WHERE IS YOUR FATHER

 JESUS ANSWERED YOU KNOW NEITHER ME NOR MY FATHER

IF YOU KNEW ME YOU WOULD KNOW MY FATHER ALSO

 THESE WORDS HE SPOKE IN THE TREASURY AS HE TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE; BUT NO ONE ARRESTED HIM BECAUSE HIS HOUR HAD NOT YET COME

SO HE SAID TO THEM AGAIN I AM GOING AWAY AND YOU WILL SEEK ME AND YOU WILL DIE IN YOUR SIN

WHERE I AM GOING YOU CANNOT COME

 SO THE JEWS SAID WILL HE KILL HIMSELF SINCE HE SAYS 'WHERE I AM GOING YOU CANNOT COME'

 HE SAID TO THEM YOU ARE FROM BELOW; I AM FROM ABOVE

YOU ARE OF THIS WORLD; I AM NOT OF THIS WORLD

I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WOULD DIE IN YOUR SINS FOR UNLESS YOU BELIEVE THAT I AM HE YOU WILL DIE IN YOUR SINS

 SO THEY SAID TO HIM WHO ARE YOU

 JESUS SAID TO THEM JUST WHAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU FROM THE BEGINNING

I HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT YOU AND MUCH TO JUDGE BUT HE WHO SENT ME IS TRUE AND I DECLARE TO THE WORLD WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM HIM

 THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO THEM ABOUT THE FATHER

SO JESUS SAID TO THEM WHEN YOU HAVE LIFTED UP THE SON OF MAN THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM HE AND THAT I DO NOTHING ON MY OWN AUTHORITY BUT SPEAK JUST AS THE FATHER TAUGHT ME

AND HE WHO SENT ME IS WITH ME

HE HAS NOT LEFT ME ALONE FOR I ALWAYS DO THE THINGS THAT ARE PLEASING TO HIM

 AS HE WAS SAYING THESE THINGS MANY BELIEVED IN HIM

SO JESUS SAID TO THE JEWS WHO HAD BELIEVED IN HIM IF YOU ABIDE IN MY WORD YOU ARE TRULY MY DISCIPLES AND YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE

 THEY ANSWERED HIM WE ARE OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ENSLAVED TO ANYONE

HOW IS IT THAT YOU SAY 'YOU WILL BECOME FREE'

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU EVERYONE WHO COMMITS SIN IS A SLAVE TO SIN

THE SLAVE DOES NOT REMAIN IN THE HOUSE FOREVER; THE SON REMAINS FOREVER

SO IF THE SON SETS YOU FREE YOU WILL BE FREE INDEED

I KNOW THAT YOU ARE OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM; YET YOU SEEK TO KILL ME BECAUSE MY WORD FINDS NO PLACE IN YOU

I SPEAK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY FATHER AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM YOUR FATHER

 THEY ANSWERED HIM ABRAHAM IS OUR FATHER

 JESUS SAID TO THEM IF YOU WERE ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN YOU WOULD BE DOING WHAT ABRAHAM DID BUT NOW YOU SEEK TO KILL ME A MAN WHO HAS TOLD YOU THE TRUTH THAT I HEARD FROM GOD

THIS IS NOT WHAT ABRAHAM DID

YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOUR FATHER DID

 THEY SAID TO HIM WE WERE NOT BORN OF SEXUAL IMMORALITY

WE HAVE ONE FATHEREVEN GOD

 JESUS SAID TO THEM IF GOD WERE YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME FOR I CAME FROM GOD AND I AM HERE

I CAME NOT OF MY OWN ACCORD BUT HE SENT ME

WHY DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY

IT IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BEAR TO HEAR MY WORD

YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL AND YOUR WILL IS TO DO YOUR FATHER'S DESIRES

HE WAS A MURDERER FROM THE BEGINNING AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TRUTH BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN HIM

WHEN HE LIES HE SPEAKS OUT OF HIS OWN CHARACTER FOR HE IS A LIAR AND THE FATHER OF LIES

BUT BECAUSE I TELL THE TRUTH YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME

WHICH ONE OF YOU CONVICTS ME OF SIN

IF I TELL THE TRUTH WHY DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME

WHOEVER IS OF GOD HEARS THE WORDS OF GOD

THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT HEAR THEM IS THAT YOU ARE NOT OF GOD

 THE JEWS ANSWERED HIM ARE WE NOT RIGHT IN SAYING THAT YOU ARE A SAMARITAN AND HAVE A DEMON

 JESUS ANSWERED I DO NOT HAVE A DEMON BUT I HONOR MY FATHER AND YOU DISHONOR ME

YET I DO NOT SEEK MY OWN GLORY; THERE IS ONE WHO SEEKS IT AND HE IS THE JUDGE

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU IF ANYONE KEEPS MY WORD HE WILL NEVER SEE DEATH

 THE JEWS SAID TO HIM NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A DEMON

ABRAHAM DIED AS DID THE PROPHETS YET YOU SAY 'IF ANYONE KEEPS MY WORD HE WILL NEVER TASTE DEATH

' ARE YOU GREATER THAN OUR FATHER ABRAHAM WHO DIED

AND THE PROPHETS DIED

WHO DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF OUT TO BE

 JESUS ANSWERED IF I GLORIFY MYSELF MY GLORY IS NOTHING

IT IS MY FATHER WHO GLORIFIES ME OF WHOM YOU SAY 'HE IS OUR GOD

' BUT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM

I KNOW HIM

IF I WERE TO SAY THAT I DO NOT KNOW HIM I WOULD BE A LIAR LIKE YOU BUT I DO KNOW HIM AND I KEEP HIS WORD

YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM REJOICED THAT HE WOULD SEE MY DAY

HE SAW IT AND WAS GLAD

 SO THE JEWS SAID TO HIM YOU ARE NOT YET FIFTY YEARS OLD AND HAVE YOU SEEN ABRAHAM

 JESUS SAID TO THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU BEFORE ABRAHAM WAS I AM

 SO THEY PICKED UP STONES TO THROW AT HIM BUT JESUS HID HIMSELF AND WENT OUT OF THE TEMPLE

AS HE PASSED BY HE SAW A MAN BLIND FROM BIRTH

AND HIS DISCIPLES ASKED HIM RABBI WHO SINNED THIS MAN OR HIS PARENTS THAT HE WAS BORN BLIND

 JESUS ANSWERED IT WAS NOT THAT THIS MAN SINNED OR HIS PARENTS BUT THAT THE WORKS OF GOD MIGHT BE DISPLAYED IN HIM

WE MUST WORK THE WORKS OF HIM WHO SENT ME WHILE IT IS DAY; NIGHT IS COMING WHEN NO ONE CAN WORK

AS LONG AS I AM IN THE WORLD I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

 HAVING SAID THESE THINGS HE SPAT ON THE GROUND AND MADE MUD WITH THE SALIVA

THEN HE ANOINTED THE MAN'S EYES WITH THE MUD AND SAID TO HIM GO WASH IN THE POOL OF SILOAM WHICH MEANS SENT

SO HE WENT AND WASHED AND CAME BACK SEEING

THE NEIGHBORS AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE AS A BEGGAR WERE SAYING IS THIS NOT THE MAN WHO USED TO SIT AND BEG

 SOME SAID IT IS HE

 OTHERS SAID NO BUT HE IS LIKE HIM

 HE KEPT SAYING I AM THE MAN

 SO THEY SAID TO HIM THEN HOW WERE YOUR EYES OPENED

 HE ANSWERED THE MAN CALLED JESUS MADE MUD AND ANOINTED MY EYES AND SAID TO ME 'GO TO SILOAM AND WASH

' SO I WENT AND WASHED AND RECEIVED MY SIGHT

 THEY SAID TO HIM WHERE IS HE

 HE SAID I DO NOT KNOW

 THEY BROUGHT TO THE PHARISEES THE MAN WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN BLIND

NOW IT WAS A SABBATH DAY WHEN JESUS MADE THE MUD AND OPENED HIS EYES

SO THE PHARISEES AGAIN ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD RECEIVED HIS SIGHT

AND HE SAID TO THEM HE PUT MUD ON MY EYES AND I WASHED AND I SEE

 SOME OF THE PHARISEES SAID THIS MAN IS NOT FROM GOD FOR HE DOES NOT KEEP THE SABBATH

 BUT OTHERS SAID HOW CAN A MAN WHO IS A SINNER DO SUCH SIGNS

 AND THERE WAS A DIVISION AMONG THEM

SO THEY SAID AGAIN TO THE BLIND MAN WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT HIM SINCE HE HAS OPENED YOUR EYES

 HE SAID HE IS A PROPHET

 THE JEWS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN BLIND AND HAD RECEIVED HIS SIGHT UNTIL THEY CALLED THE PARENTS OF THE MAN WHO HAD RECEIVED HIS SIGHT AND ASKED THEM IS THIS YOUR SON WHO YOU SAY WAS BORN BLIND

HOW THEN DOES HE NOW SEE

 HIS PARENTS ANSWERED WE KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR SON AND THAT HE WAS BORN BLIND

BUT HOW HE NOW SEES WE DO NOT KNOW NOR DO WE KNOW WHO OPENED HIS EYES

ASK HIM; HE IS OF AGE

HE WILL SPEAK FOR HIMSELF

 HIS PARENTS SAID THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY FEARED THE JEWS FOR THE JEWS HAD ALREADY AGREED THAT IF ANYONE SHOULD CONFESS JESUS TO BE CHRIST HE WAS TO BE PUT OUT OF THE SYNAGOGUE

 THEREFORE HIS PARENTS SAID HE IS OF AGE; ASK HIM

 SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THEY CALLED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN BLIND AND SAID TO HIM GIVE GLORY TO GOD

WE KNOW THAT THIS MAN IS A SINNER

 HE ANSWERED WHETHER HE IS A SINNER I DO NOT KNOW

ONE THING I DO KNOW THAT THOUGH I WAS BLIND NOW I SEE

 THEY SAID TO HIM WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU

HOW DID HE OPEN YOUR EYES

 HE ANSWERED THEM I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY AND YOU WOULD NOT LISTEN

WHY DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN

DO YOU ALSO WANT TO BECOME HIS DISCIPLES

 AND THEY REVILED HIM SAYING YOU ARE HIS DISCIPLE BUT WE ARE DISCIPLES OF MOSES

WE KNOW THAT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO MOSES BUT AS FOR THIS MAN WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM

 THE MAN ANSWERED WHY THIS IS AN AMAZING THING

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM AND YET HE OPENED MY EYES

WE KNOW THAT GOD DOES NOT LISTEN TO SINNERS BUT IF ANYONE IS A WORSHIPER OF GOD AND DOES HIS WILL GOD LISTENS TO HIM

NEVER SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN HAS IT BEEN HEARD THAT ANYONE OPENED THE EYES OF A MAN BORN BLIND

IF THIS MAN WERE NOT FROM GOD HE COULD DO NOTHING

 THEY ANSWERED HIM YOU WERE BORN IN UTTER SIN AND WOULD YOU TEACH US

 AND THEY CAST HIM OUT

JESUS HEARD THAT THEY HAD CAST HIM OUT AND HAVING FOUND HIM HE SAID DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE SON OF MAN

 HE ANSWERED AND WHO IS HE SIR THAT I MAY BELIEVE IN HIM

 JESUS SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE SEEN HIM AND IT IS HE WHO IS SPEAKING TO YOU

 HE SAID LORD I BELIEVE AND HE WORSHIPED HIM

JESUS SAID FOR JUDGMENT I CAME INTO THIS WORLD THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT SEE MAY SEE AND THOSE WHO SEE MAY BECOME BLIND

 SOME OF THE PHARISEES NEAR HIM HEARD THESE THINGS AND SAID TO HIM ARE WE ALSO BLIND

 JESUS SAID TO THEM IF YOU WERE BLIND YOU WOULD HAVE NO GUILT; BUT NOW THAT YOU SAY 'WE SEE' YOUR GUILT REMAINS

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU HE WHO DOES NOT ENTER THE SHEEPFOLD BY THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS IN BY ANOTHER WAY THAT MAN IS A THIEF AND A ROBBER

BUT HE WHO ENTERS BY THE DOOR IS THE SHEPHERD OF THE SHEEP

TO HIM THE GATEKEEPER OPENS

THE SHEEP HEAR HIS VOICE AND HE CALLS HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADS THEM OUT

WHEN HE HAS BROUGHT OUT ALL HIS OWN HE GOES BEFORE THEM AND THE SHEEP FOLLOW HIM FOR THEY KNOW HIS VOICE

A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW BUT THEY WILL FLEE FROM HIM FOR THEY DO NOT KNOW THE VOICE OF STRANGERS

 THIS FIGURE OF SPEECH JESUS USED WITH THEM BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO THEM

SO JESUS AGAIN SAID TO THEM TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU I AM THE DOOR OF THE SHEEP

ALL WHO CAME BEFORE ME ARE THIEVES AND ROBBERS BUT THE SHEEP DID NOT LISTEN TO THEM

I AM THE DOOR

IF ANYONE ENTERS BY ME HE WILL BE SAVED AND WILL GO IN AND OUT AND FIND PASTURE

THE THIEF COMES ONLY TO STEAL AND KILL AND DESTROY

I CAME THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT ABUNDANTLY

I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD

THE GOOD SHEPHERD LAYS DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE SHEEP

HE WHO IS A HIRED HAND AND NOT A SHEPHERD WHO DOES NOT OWN THE SHEEP SEES THE WOLF COMING AND LEAVES THE SHEEP AND FLEES AND THE WOLF SNATCHES THEM AND SCATTERS THEM

HE FLEES BECAUSE HE IS A HIRED HAND AND CARES NOTHING FOR THE SHEEP

I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD

I KNOW MY OWN AND MY OWN KNOW ME JUST AS THE FATHER KNOWS ME AND I KNOW THE FATHER; AND I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR THE SHEEP

AND I HAVE OTHER SHEEP THAT ARE NOT OF THIS FOLD

I MUST BRING THEM ALSO AND THEY WILL LISTEN TO MY VOICE

SO THERE WILL BE ONE FLOCK ONE SHEPHERD

FOR THIS REASON THE FATHER LOVES ME BECAUSE I LAY DOWN MY LIFE THAT I MAY TAKE IT UP AGAIN

NO ONE TAKES IT FROM ME BUT I LAY IT DOWN OF MY OWN ACCORD

I HAVE AUTHORITY TO LAY IT DOWN AND I HAVE AUTHORITY TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN

THIS CHARGE I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MY FATHER

 THERE WAS AGAIN A DIVISION AMONG THE JEWS BECAUSE OF THESE WORDS

MANY OF THEM SAID HE HAS A DEMON AND IS INSANE; WHY LISTEN TO HIM

 OTHERS SAID THESE ARE NOT THE WORDS OF ONE WHO IS OPPRESSED BY A DEMON

CAN A DEMON OPEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND

 AT THAT TIME THE FEAST OF DEDICATION TOOK PLACE AT JERUSALEM

IT WAS WINTER AND JESUS WAS WALKING IN THE TEMPLE IN THE COLONNADE OF SOLOMON

SO THE JEWS GATHERED AROUND HIM AND SAID TO HIM HOW LONG WILL YOU KEEP US IN SUSPENSE

IF YOU ARE THE CHRIST TELL US PLAINLY

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM I TOLD YOU AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE

THE WORKS THAT I DO IN MY FATHER'S NAME BEAR WITNESS ABOUT ME BUT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT PART OF MY FLOCK

MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I KNOW THEM AND THEY FOLLOW ME

I GIVE THEM ETERNAL LIFE AND THEY WILL NEVER PERISH AND NO ONE WILL SNATCH THEM OUT OF MY HAND

MY FATHER WHO HAS GIVEN THEM TO ME IS GREATER THAN ALL AND NO ONE IS ABLE TO SNATCH THEM OUT OF THE FATHER'S HAND

I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE

 THE JEWS PICKED UP STONES AGAIN TO STONE HIM

JESUS ANSWERED THEM I HAVE SHOWN YOU MANY GOOD WORKS FROM THE FATHER; FOR WHICH OF THEM ARE YOU GOING TO STONE ME

 THE JEWS ANSWERED HIM IT IS NOT FOR A GOOD WORK THAT WE ARE GOING TO STONE YOU BUT FOR BLASPHEMY BECAUSE YOU BEING A MAN MAKE YOURSELF GOD

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM IS IT NOT WRITTEN IN YOUR LAW 'I SAID YOU ARE GODS'

IF HE CALLED THEM GODS TO WHOM THE WORD OF GOD CAMEAND SCRIPTURE CANNOT BE BROKEN DO YOU SAY OF HIM WHOM THE FATHER CONSECRATED AND SENT INTO THE WORLD 'YOU ARE BLASPHEMING' BECAUSE I SAID 'I AM THE SON OF GOD'

IF I AM NOT DOING THE WORKS OF MY FATHER THEN DO NOT BELIEVE ME; BUT IF I DO THEM EVEN THOUGH YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME BELIEVE THE WORKS THAT YOU MAY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE FATHER IS IN ME AND I AM IN THE FATHER

 AGAIN THEY SOUGHT TO ARREST HIM BUT HE ESCAPED FROM THEIR HANDS

HE WENT AWAY AGAIN ACROSS THE JORDAN TO THE PLACE WHERE JOHN HAD BEEN BAPTIZING AT FIRST AND THERE HE REMAINED

AND MANY CAME TO HIM

AND THEY SAID JOHN DID NO SIGN BUT EVERYTHING THAT JOHN SAID ABOUT THIS MAN WAS TRUE

 AND MANY BELIEVED IN HIM THERE

NOW A CERTAIN MAN WAS ILL LAZARUS OF BETHANY THE VILLAGE OF MARY AND HER SISTER MARTHA

IT WAS MARY WHO ANOINTED THE LORD WITH OINTMENT AND WIPED HIS FEET WITH HER HAIR WHOSE BROTHER LAZARUS WAS ILL

SO THE SISTERS SENT TO HIM SAYING LORD HE WHOM YOU LOVE IS ILL

 BUT WHEN JESUS HEARD IT HE SAID THIS ILLNESS DOES NOT LEAD TO DEATH

IT IS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD SO THAT THE SON OF GOD MAY BE GLORIFIED THROUGH IT

 NOW JESUS LOVED MARTHA AND HER SISTER AND LAZARUS

SO WHEN HE HEARD THAT LAZARUS WAS ILL HE STAYED TWO DAYS LONGER IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS

THEN AFTER THIS HE SAID TO THE DISCIPLES LET US GO TO JUDEA AGAIN

 THE DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM RABBI THE JEWS WERE JUST NOW SEEKING TO STONE YOU AND ARE YOU GOING THERE AGAIN

 JESUS ANSWERED ARE THERE NOT TWELVE HOURS IN THE DAY

IF ANYONE WALKS IN THE DAY HE DOES NOT STUMBLE BECAUSE HE SEES THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD

BUT IF ANYONE WALKS IN THE NIGHT HE STUMBLES BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS NOT IN HIM

 AFTER SAYING THESE THINGS HE SAID TO THEM OUR FRIEND LAZARUS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP BUT I GO TO AWAKEN HIM

 THE DISCIPLES SAID TO HIM LORD IF HE HAS FALLEN ASLEEP HE WILL RECOVER

 NOW JESUS HAD SPOKEN OF HIS DEATH BUT THEY THOUGHT THAT HE MEANT TAKING REST IN SLEEP

THEN JESUS TOLD THEM PLAINLY LAZARUS HAS DIED AND FOR YOUR SAKE I AM GLAD THAT I WAS NOT THERE SO THAT YOU MAY BELIEVE

BUT LET US GO TO HIM

 SO THOMAS CALLED THE TWIN SAID TO HIS FELLOW DISCIPLES LET US ALSO GO THAT WE MAY DIE WITH HIM

 NOW WHEN JESUS CAME HE FOUND THAT LAZARUS HAD ALREADY BEEN IN THE TOMB FOUR DAYS

BETHANY WAS NEAR JERUSALEM ABOUT TWO MILES OFF AND MANY OF THE JEWS HAD COME TO MARTHA AND MARY TO CONSOLE THEM CONCERNING THEIR BROTHER

SO WHEN MARTHA HEARD THAT JESUS WAS COMING SHE WENT AND MET HIM BUT MARY REMAINED SEATED IN THE HOUSE

MARTHA SAID TO JESUS LORD IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT HAVE DIED

BUT EVEN NOW I KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU ASK FROM GOD GOD WILL GIVE YOU

 JESUS SAID TO HER YOUR BROTHER WILL RISE AGAIN

 MARTHA SAID TO HIM I KNOW THAT HE WILL RISE AGAIN IN THE RESURRECTION ON THE LAST DAY

 JESUS SAID TO HER I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE

WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME THOUGH HE DIE YET SHALL HE LIVE AND EVERYONE WHO LIVES AND BELIEVES IN ME SHALL NEVER DIE

DO YOU BELIEVE THIS

 SHE SAID TO HIM YES LORD; I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WHO IS COMING INTO THE WORLD

 WHEN SHE HAD SAID THIS SHE WENT AND CALLED HER SISTER MARY SAYING IN PRIVATE THE TEACHER IS HERE AND IS CALLING FOR YOU

 AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT SHE ROSE QUICKLY AND WENT TO HIM

NOW JESUS HAD NOT YET COME INTO THE VILLAGE BUT WAS STILL IN THE PLACE WHERE MARTHA HAD MET HIM

WHEN THE JEWS WHO WERE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE CONSOLING HER SAW MARY RISE QUICKLY AND GO OUT THEY FOLLOWED HER SUPPOSING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO THE TOMB TO WEEP THERE

NOW WHEN MARY CAME TO WHERE JESUS WAS AND SAW HIM SHE FELL AT HIS FEET SAYING TO HIM LORD IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT HAVE DIED

 WHEN JESUS SAW HER WEEPING AND THE JEWS WHO HAD COME WITH HER ALSO WEEPING HE WAS DEEPLY MOVED IN HIS SPIRIT AND GREATLY TROUBLED

AND HE SAID WHERE HAVE YOU LAID HIM

 THEY SAID TO HIM LORD COME AND SEE

 JESUS WEPT

SO THE JEWS SAID SEE HOW HE LOVED HIM

 BUT SOME OF THEM SAID COULD NOT HE WHO OPENED THE EYES OF THE BLIND MAN ALSO HAVE KEPT THIS MAN FROM DYING

 THEN JESUS DEEPLY MOVED AGAIN CAME TO THE TOMB

IT WAS A CAVE AND A STONE LAY AGAINST IT

JESUS SAID TAKE AWAY THE STONE

 MARTHA THE SISTER OF THE DEAD MAN SAID TO HIM LORD BY THIS TIME THERE WILL BE AN ODOR FOR HE HAS BEEN DEAD FOUR DAYS

 JESUS SAID TO HER DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT IF YOU BELIEVED YOU WOULD SEE THE GLORY OF GOD

 SO THEY TOOK AWAY THE STONE

AND JESUS LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAID FATHER I THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ME

I KNEW THAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR ME BUT I SAID THIS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE THAT YOU SENT ME

 WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE LAZARUS COME OUT

 THE MAN WHO HAD DIED CAME OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET BOUND WITH LINEN STRIPS AND HIS FACE WRAPPED WITH A CLOTH

JESUS SAID TO THEM UNBIND HIM AND LET HIM GO

 MANY OF THE JEWS THEREFORE WHO HAD COME WITH MARY AND HAD SEEN WHAT HE DID BELIEVED IN HIM BUT SOME OF THEM WENT TO THE PHARISEES AND TOLD THEM WHAT JESUS HAD DONE

SO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PHARISEES GATHERED THE COUNCIL AND SAID WHAT ARE WE TO DO

FOR THIS MAN PERFORMS MANY SIGNS

IF WE LET HIM GO ON LIKE THIS EVERYONE WILL BELIEVE IN HIM AND THE ROMANS WILL COME AND TAKE AWAY BOTH OUR PLACE AND OUR NATION

 BUT ONE OF THEM CAIAPHAS WHO WAS HIGH PRIEST THAT YEAR SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW NOTHING AT ALL

NOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BETTER FOR YOU THAT ONE MAN SHOULD DIE FOR THE PEOPLE NOT THAT THE WHOLE NATION SHOULD PERISH

 HE DID NOT SAY THIS OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT BEING HIGH PRIEST THAT YEAR HE PROPHESIED THAT JESUS WOULD DIE FOR THE NATION AND NOT FOR THE NATION ONLY BUT ALSO TO GATHER INTO ONE THE CHILDREN OF GOD WHO ARE SCATTERED ABROAD

SO FROM THAT DAY ON THEY MADE PLANS TO PUT HIM TO DEATH

JESUS THEREFORE NO LONGER WALKED OPENLY AMONG THE JEWS BUT WENT FROM THERE TO THE REGION NEAR THE WILDERNESS TO A TOWN CALLED EPHRAIM AND THERE HE STAYED WITH THE DISCIPLES

NOW THE PASSOVER OF THE JEWS WAS AT HAND AND MANY WENT UP FROM THE COUNTRY TO JERUSALEM BEFORE THE PASSOVER TO PURIFY THEMSELVES

THEY WERE LOOKING FOR JESUS AND SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER AS THEY STOOD IN THE TEMPLE WHAT DO YOU THINK

THAT HE WILL NOT COME TO THE FEAST AT ALL

 NOW THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PHARISEES HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT IF ANYONE KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE SHOULD LET THEM KNOW SO THAT THEY MIGHT ARREST HIM

SIX DAYS BEFORE THE PASSOVER JESUS THEREFORE CAME TO BETHANY WHERE LAZARUS WAS WHOM JESUS HAD RAISED FROM THE DEAD

SO THEY GAVE A DINNER FOR HIM THERE

MARTHA SERVED AND LAZARUS WAS ONE OF THOSE RECLINING WITH HIM AT THE TABLE

MARY THEREFORE TOOK A POUND OF EXPENSIVE OINTMENT MADE FROM PURE NARD AND ANOINTED THE FEET OF JESUS AND WIPED HIS FEET WITH HER HAIR

THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PERFUME

BUT JUDAS ISCARIOT ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES HE WHO WAS ABOUT TO BETRAY HIM SAID WHY WAS THIS OINTMENT NOT SOLD FOR THREE HUNDRED DENARII AND GIVEN TO THE POOR

 HE SAID THIS NOT BECAUSE HE CARED ABOUT THE POOR BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A THIEF AND HAVING CHARGE OF THE MONEYBAG HE USED TO HELP HIMSELF TO WHAT WAS PUT INTO IT

JESUS SAID LEAVE HER ALONE SO THAT SHE MAY KEEP IT FOR THE DAY OF MY BURIAL

THE POOR YOU ALWAYS HAVE WITH YOU BUT YOU DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE ME

 WHEN THE LARGE CROWD OF THE JEWS LEARNED THAT JESUS WAS THERE THEY CAME NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIM BUT ALSO TO SEE LAZARUS WHOM HE HAD RAISED FROM THE DEAD

SO THE CHIEF PRIESTS MADE PLANS TO PUT LAZARUS TO DEATH AS WELL BECAUSE ON ACCOUNT OF HIM MANY OF THE JEWS WERE GOING AWAY AND BELIEVING IN JESUS

THE NEXT DAY THE LARGE CROWD THAT HAD COME TO THE FEAST HEARD THAT JESUS WAS COMING TO JERUSALEM

SO THEY TOOK BRANCHES OF PALM TREES AND WENT OUT TO MEET HIM CRYING OUT HOSANNA

BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD EVEN THE KING OF ISRAEL

 AND JESUS FOUND A YOUNG DONKEY AND SAT ON IT JUST AS IT IS WRITTEN FEAR NOT DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING SITTING ON A DONKEY'S COLT

 HIS DISCIPLES DID NOT UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS AT FIRST BUT WHEN JESUS WAS GLORIFIED THEN THEY REMEMBERED THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HIM AND HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM

THE CROWD THAT HAD BEEN WITH HIM WHEN HE CALLED LAZARUS OUT OF THE TOMB AND RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD CONTINUED TO BEAR WITNESS

THE REASON WHY THE CROWD WENT TO MEET HIM WAS THAT THEY HEARD HE HAD DONE THIS SIGN

SO THE PHARISEES SAID TO ONE ANOTHER YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE GAINING NOTHING

LOOK THE WORLD HAS GONE AFTER HIM

 NOW AMONG THOSE WHO WENT UP TO WORSHIP AT THE FEAST WERE SOME GREEKS

SO THESE CAME TO PHILIP WHO WAS FROM BETHSAIDA IN GALILEE AND ASKED HIM SIR WE WISH TO SEE JESUS

 PHILIP WENT AND TOLD ANDREW; ANDREW AND PHILIP WENT AND TOLD JESUS

AND JESUS ANSWERED THEM THE HOUR HAS COME FOR THE SON OF MAN TO BE GLORIFIED

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU UNLESS A GRAIN OF WHEAT FALLS INTO THE EARTH AND DIES IT REMAINS ALONE; BUT IF IT DIES IT BEARS MUCH FRUIT

WHOEVER LOVES HIS LIFE LOSES IT AND WHOEVER HATES HIS LIFE IN THIS WORLD WILL KEEP IT FOR ETERNAL LIFE

IF ANYONE SERVES ME HE MUST FOLLOW ME; AND WHERE I AM THERE WILL MY SERVANT BE ALSO

IF ANYONE SERVES ME THE FATHER WILL HONOR HIM

NOW IS MY SOUL TROUBLED

AND WHAT SHALL I SAY

'FATHER SAVE ME FROM THIS HOUR'

BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE COME TO THIS HOUR

FATHER GLORIFY YOUR NAME

 THEN A VOICE CAME FROM HEAVEN I HAVE GLORIFIED IT AND I WILL GLORIFY IT AGAIN

 THE CROWD THAT STOOD THERE AND HEARD IT SAID THAT IT HAD THUNDERED

OTHERS SAID AN ANGEL HAS SPOKEN TO HIM

 JESUS ANSWERED THIS VOICE HAS COME FOR YOUR SAKE NOT MINE

NOW IS THE JUDGMENT OF THIS WORLD; NOW WILL THE RULER OF THIS WORLD BE CAST OUT

AND I WHEN I AM LIFTED UP FROM THE EARTH WILL DRAW ALL PEOPLE TO MYSELF

 HE SAID THIS TO SHOW BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WAS GOING TO DIE

SO THE CROWD ANSWERED HIM WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE LAW THAT THE CHRIST REMAINS FOREVER

HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT THE SON OF MAN MUST BE LIFTED UP

WHO IS THIS SON OF MAN

 SO JESUS SAID TO THEM THE LIGHT IS AMONG YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER

WALK WHILE YOU HAVE THE LIGHT LEST DARKNESS OVERTAKE YOU

THE ONE WHO WALKS IN THE DARKNESS DOES NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS GOING

WHILE YOU HAVE THE LIGHT BELIEVE IN THE LIGHT THAT YOU MAY BECOME SONS OF LIGHT

WHEN JESUS HAD SAID THESE THINGS HE DEPARTED AND HID HIMSELF FROM THEM

THOUGH HE HAD DONE SO MANY SIGNS BEFORE THEM THEY STILL DID NOT BELIEVE IN HIM SO THAT THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH MIGHT BE FULFILLED LORD WHO HAS BELIEVED WHAT HE HEARD FROM US AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED

 THEREFORE THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE

FOR AGAIN ISAIAH SAID HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HARDENED THEIR HEART LEST THEY SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND TURN AND I WOULD HEAL THEM

 ISAIAH SAID THESE THINGS BECAUSE HE SAW HIS GLORY AND SPOKE OF HIM

NEVERTHELESS MANY EVEN OF THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVED IN HIM BUT FOR FEAR OF THE PHARISEES THEY DID NOT CONFESS IT SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE PUT OUT OF THE SYNAGOGUE; FOR THEY LOVED THE GLORY THAT COMES FROM MAN MORE THAN THE GLORY THAT COMES FROM GOD

AND JESUS CRIED OUT AND SAID WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME BELIEVES NOT IN ME BUT IN HIM WHO SENT ME

AND WHOEVER SEES ME SEES HIM WHO SENT ME

I HAVE COME INTO THE WORLD AS LIGHT SO THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME MAY NOT REMAIN IN DARKNESS

IF ANYONE HEARS MY WORDS AND DOES NOT KEEP THEM I DO NOT JUDGE HIM; FOR I DID NOT COME TO JUDGE THE WORLD BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD

THE ONE WHO REJECTS ME AND DOES NOT RECEIVE MY WORDS HAS A JUDGE; THE WORD THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WILL JUDGE HIM ON THE LAST DAY

FOR I HAVE NOT SPOKEN ON MY OWN AUTHORITY BUT THE FATHER WHO SENT ME HAS HIMSELF GIVEN ME A COMMANDMENTWHAT TO SAY AND WHAT TO SPEAK

AND I KNOW THAT HIS COMMANDMENT IS ETERNAL LIFE

WHAT I SAY THEREFORE I SAY AS THE FATHER HAS TOLD ME

NOW BEFORE THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER WHEN JESUS KNEW THAT HIS HOUR HAD COME TO DEPART OUT OF THIS WORLD TO THE FATHER HAVING LOVED HIS OWN WHO WERE IN THE WORLD HE LOVED THEM TO THE END

DURING SUPPER WHEN THE DEVIL HAD ALREADY PUT IT INTO THE HEART OF JUDAS ISCARIOT SIMON'S SON TO BETRAY HIM JESUS KNOWING THAT THE FATHER HAD GIVEN ALL THINGS INTO HIS HANDS AND THAT HE HAD COME FROM GOD AND WAS GOING BACK TO GOD ROSE FROM SUPPER

HE LAID ASIDE HIS OUTER GARMENTS AND TAKING A TOWEL TIED IT AROUND HIS WAIST

THEN HE POURED WATER INTO A BASIN AND BEGAN TO WASH THE DISCIPLES' FEET AND TO WIPE THEM WITH THE TOWEL THAT WAS WRAPPED AROUND HIM

HE CAME TO SIMON PETER WHO SAID TO HIM LORD DO YOU WASH MY FEET

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM WHAT I AM DOING YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOW BUT AFTERWARD YOU WILL UNDERSTAND

 PETER SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL NEVER WASH MY FEET

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM IF I DO NOT WASH YOU YOU HAVE NO SHARE WITH ME

 SIMON PETER SAID TO HIM LORD NOT MY FEET ONLY BUT ALSO MY HANDS AND MY HEAD

 JESUS SAID TO HIM THE ONE WHO HAS BATHED DOES NOT NEED TO WASH EXCEPT FOR HIS FEET BUT IS COMPLETELY CLEAN

AND YOU ARE CLEAN BUT NOT EVERY ONE OF YOU

 FOR HE KNEW WHO WAS TO BETRAY HIM; THAT WAS WHY HE SAID NOT ALL OF YOU ARE CLEAN

 WHEN HE HAD WASHED THEIR FEET AND PUT ON HIS OUTER GARMENTS AND RESUMED HIS PLACE HE SAID TO THEM DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE DONE TO YOU

YOU CALL ME TEACHER AND LORD AND YOU ARE RIGHT FOR SO I AM

IF I THEN YOUR LORD AND TEACHER HAVE WASHED YOUR FEET YOU ALSO OUGHT TO WASH ONE ANOTHER'S FEET

FOR I HAVE GIVEN YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU ALSO SHOULD DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE TO YOU

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU A SERVANT IS NOT GREATER THAN HIS MASTER NOR IS A MESSENGER GREATER THAN THE ONE WHO SENT HIM

IF YOU KNOW THESE THINGS BLESSED ARE YOU IF YOU DO THEM

I AM NOT SPEAKING OF ALL OF YOU; I KNOW WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN

BUT THE SCRIPTURE WILL BE FULFILLED 'HE WHO ATE MY BREAD HAS LIFTED HIS HEEL AGAINST ME

' I AM TELLING YOU THIS NOW BEFORE IT TAKES PLACE THAT WHEN IT DOES TAKE PLACE YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT I AM HE

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER RECEIVES THE ONE I SEND RECEIVES ME AND WHOEVER RECEIVES ME RECEIVES THE ONE WHO SENT ME

 AFTER SAYING THESE THINGS JESUS WAS TROUBLED IN HIS SPIRIT AND TESTIFIED TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME

 THE DISCIPLES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER UNCERTAIN OF WHOM HE SPOKE

ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES WHOM JESUS LOVED WAS RECLINING AT TABLE CLOSE TO JESUS SO SIMON PETER MOTIONED TO HIM TO ASK JESUS OF WHOM HE WAS SPEAKING

SO THAT DISCIPLE LEANING BACK AGAINST JESUS SAID TO HIM LORD WHO IS IT

 JESUS ANSWERED IT IS HE TO WHOM I WILL GIVE THIS MORSEL OF BREAD WHEN I HAVE DIPPED IT

 SO WHEN HE HAD DIPPED THE MORSEL HE GAVE IT TO JUDAS THE SON OF SIMON ISCARIOT

THEN AFTER HE HAD TAKEN THE MORSEL SATAN ENTERED INTO HIM

JESUS SAID TO HIM WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO DO QUICKLY

 NOW NO ONE AT THE TABLE KNEW WHY HE SAID THIS TO HIM

SOME THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE JUDAS HAD THE MONEYBAG JESUS WAS TELLING HIM BUY WHAT WE NEED FOR THE FEAST OR THAT HE SHOULD GIVE SOMETHING TO THE POOR

SO AFTER RECEIVING THE MORSEL OF BREAD HE IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT

AND IT WAS NIGHT

WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT JESUS SAID NOW IS THE SON OF MAN GLORIFIED AND GOD IS GLORIFIED IN HIM

IF GOD IS GLORIFIED IN HIM GOD WILL ALSO GLORIFY HIM IN HIMSELF AND GLORIFY HIM AT ONCE

LITTLE CHILDREN YET A LITTLE WHILE I AM WITH YOU

YOU WILL SEEK ME AND JUST AS I SAID TO THE JEWS SO NOW I ALSO SAY TO YOU 'WHERE I AM GOING YOU CANNOT COME

' A NEW COMMANDMENT I GIVE TO YOU THAT YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER JUST AS I HAVE LOVED YOU YOU ALSO ARE TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER

BY THIS ALL PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE MY DISCIPLES IF YOU HAVE LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER

 SIMON PETER SAID TO HIM LORD WHERE ARE YOU GOING

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM WHERE I AM GOING YOU CANNOT FOLLOW ME NOW BUT YOU WILL FOLLOW AFTERWARD

 PETER SAID TO HIM LORD WHY CAN I NOT FOLLOW YOU NOW

I WILL LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU

 JESUS ANSWERED WILL YOU LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE FOR ME

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU THE ROOSTER WILL NOT CROW TILL YOU HAVE DENIED ME THREE TIMES

LET NOT YOUR HEARTS BE TROUBLED

BELIEVE IN GOD; BELIEVE ALSO IN ME

IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ARE MANY ROOMS

IF IT WERE NOT SO WOULD I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I GO TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU

AND IF I GO AND PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU I WILL COME AGAIN AND WILL TAKE YOU TO MYSELF THAT WHERE I AM YOU MAY BE ALSO

AND YOU KNOW THE WAY TO WHERE I AM GOING

 THOMAS SAID TO HIM LORD WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING

HOW CAN WE KNOW THE WAY

 JESUS SAID TO HIM I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE

NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME

IF YOU HAD KNOWN ME YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN MY FATHER ALSO

FROM NOW ON YOU DO KNOW HIM AND HAVE SEEN HIM

 PHILIP SAID TO HIM LORD SHOW US THE FATHER AND IT IS ENOUGH FOR US

 JESUS SAID TO HIM HAVE I BEEN WITH YOU SO LONG AND YOU STILL DO NOT KNOW ME PHILIP

WHOEVER HAS SEEN ME HAS SEEN THE FATHER

HOW CAN YOU SAY 'SHOW US THE FATHER'

DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT I AM IN THE FATHER AND THE FATHER IS IN ME

THE WORDS THAT I SAY TO YOU I DO NOT SPEAK ON MY OWN AUTHORITY BUT THE FATHER WHO DWELLS IN ME DOES HIS WORKS

BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN THE FATHER AND THE FATHER IS IN ME OR ELSE BELIEVE ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORKS THEMSELVES

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHOEVER BELIEVES IN ME WILL ALSO DO THE WORKS THAT I DO; AND GREATER WORKS THAN THESE WILL HE DO BECAUSE I AM GOING TO THE FATHER

WHATEVER YOU ASK IN MY NAME THIS I WILL DO THAT THE FATHER MAY BE GLORIFIED IN THE SON

IF YOU ASK ME ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT

IF YOU LOVE ME YOU WILL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS

AND I WILL ASK THE FATHER AND HE WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER HELPER TO BE WITH YOU FOREVER EVEN THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH WHOM THE WORLD CANNOT RECEIVE BECAUSE IT NEITHER SEES HIM NOR KNOWS HIM

YOU KNOW HIM FOR HE DWELLS WITH YOU AND WILL BE IN YOU

I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU AS ORPHANS; I WILL COME TO YOU

YET A LITTLE WHILE AND THE WORLD WILL SEE ME NO MORE BUT YOU WILL SEE ME

BECAUSE I LIVE YOU ALSO WILL LIVE

IN THAT DAY YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM IN MY FATHER AND YOU IN ME AND I IN YOU

WHOEVER HAS MY COMMANDMENTS AND KEEPS THEM HE IT IS WHO LOVES ME

AND HE WHO LOVES ME WILL BE LOVED BY MY FATHER AND I WILL LOVE HIM AND MANIFEST MYSELF TO HIM

 JUDAS NOT ISCARIOT SAID TO HIM LORD HOW IS IT THAT YOU WILL MANIFEST YOURSELF TO US AND NOT TO THE WORLD

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM IF ANYONE LOVES ME HE WILL KEEP MY WORD AND MY FATHER WILL LOVE HIM AND WE WILL COME TO HIM AND MAKE OUR HOME WITH HIM

WHOEVER DOES NOT LOVE ME DOES NOT KEEP MY WORDS

AND THE WORD THAT YOU HEAR IS NOT MINE BUT THE FATHER'S WHO SENT ME

THESE THINGS I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU WHILE I AM STILL WITH YOU

BUT THE HELPER THE HOLY SPIRIT WHOM THE FATHER WILL SEND IN MY NAME HE WILL TEACH YOU ALL THINGS AND BRING TO YOUR REMEMBRANCE ALL THAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU

PEACE I LEAVE WITH YOU; MY PEACE I GIVE TO YOU

NOT AS THE WORLD GIVES DO I GIVE TO YOU

LET NOT YOUR HEARTS BE TROUBLED NEITHER LET THEM BE AFRAID

YOU HEARD ME SAY TO YOU 'I AM GOING AWAY AND I WILL COME TO YOU

' IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD HAVE REJOICED BECAUSE I AM GOING TO THE FATHER FOR THE FATHER IS GREATER THAN I

AND NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE IT TAKES PLACE SO THAT WHEN IT DOES TAKE PLACE YOU MAY BELIEVE

I WILL NO LONGER TALK MUCH WITH YOU FOR THE RULER OF THIS WORLD IS COMING

HE HAS NO CLAIM ON ME BUT I DO AS THE FATHER HAS COMMANDED ME SO THAT THE WORLD MAY KNOW THAT I LOVE THE FATHER

RISE LET US GO FROM HERE

I AM THE TRUE VINE AND MY FATHER IS THE VINEDRESSER

EVERY BRANCH OF MINE THAT DOES NOT BEAR FRUIT HE TAKES AWAY AND EVERY BRANCH THAT DOES BEAR FRUIT HE PRUNES THAT IT MAY BEAR MORE FRUIT

ALREADY YOU ARE CLEAN BECAUSE OF THE WORD THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU

ABIDE IN ME AND I IN YOU

AS THE BRANCH CANNOT BEAR FRUIT BY ITSELF UNLESS IT ABIDES IN THE VINE NEITHER CAN YOU UNLESS YOU ABIDE IN ME

I AM THE VINE; YOU ARE THE BRANCHES

WHOEVER ABIDES IN ME AND I IN HIM HE IT IS THAT BEARS MUCH FRUIT FOR APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO NOTHING

IF ANYONE DOES NOT ABIDE IN ME HE IS THROWN AWAY LIKE A BRANCH AND WITHERS; AND THE BRANCHES ARE GATHERED THROWN INTO THE FIRE AND BURNED

IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU ASK WHATEVER YOU WISH AND IT WILL BE DONE FOR YOU

BY THIS MY FATHER IS GLORIFIED THAT YOU BEAR MUCH FRUIT AND SO PROVE TO BE MY DISCIPLES

AS THE FATHER HAS LOVED ME SO HAVE I LOVED YOU

ABIDE IN MY LOVE

IF YOU KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS YOU WILL ABIDE IN MY LOVE JUST AS I HAVE KEPT MY FATHER'S COMMANDMENTS AND ABIDE IN HIS LOVE

THESE THINGS I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU THAT MY JOY MAY BE IN YOU AND THAT YOUR JOY MAY BE FULL

THIS IS MY COMMANDMENT THAT YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU

GREATER LOVE HAS NO ONE THAN THIS THAT SOMEONE LAYS DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS

YOU ARE MY FRIENDS IF YOU DO WHAT I COMMAND YOU

NO LONGER DO I CALL YOU SERVANTS FOR THE SERVANT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HIS MASTER IS DOING; BUT I HAVE CALLED YOU FRIENDS FOR ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD FROM MY FATHER I HAVE MADE KNOWN TO YOU

YOU DID NOT CHOOSE ME BUT I CHOSE YOU AND APPOINTED YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO AND BEAR FRUIT AND THAT YOUR FRUIT SHOULD ABIDE SO THAT WHATEVER YOU ASK THE FATHER IN MY NAME HE MAY GIVE IT TO YOU

THESE THINGS I COMMAND YOU SO THAT YOU WILL LOVE ONE ANOTHER

IF THE WORLD HATES YOU KNOW THAT IT HAS HATED ME BEFORE IT HATED YOU

IF YOU WERE OF THE WORLD THE WORLD WOULD LOVE YOU AS ITS OWN; BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT OF THE WORLD BUT I CHOSE YOU OUT OF THE WORLD THEREFORE THE WORLD HATES YOU

REMEMBER THE WORD THAT I SAID TO YOU 'A SERVANT IS NOT GREATER THAN HIS MASTER

' IF THEY PERSECUTED ME THEY WILL ALSO PERSECUTE YOU

IF THEY KEPT MY WORD THEY WILL ALSO KEEP YOURS

BUT ALL THESE THINGS THEY WILL DO TO YOU ON ACCOUNT OF MY NAME BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HIM WHO SENT ME

IF I HAD NOT COME AND SPOKEN TO THEM THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SIN BUT NOW THEY HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR THEIR SIN

WHOEVER HATES ME HATES MY FATHER ALSO

IF I HAD NOT DONE AMONG THEM THE WORKS THAT NO ONE ELSE DID THEY WOULD NOT BE GUILTY OF SIN BUT NOW THEY HAVE SEEN AND HATED BOTH ME AND MY FATHER

BUT THE WORD THAT IS WRITTEN IN THEIR LAW MUST BE FULFILLED 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE

' BUT WHEN THE HELPER COMES WHOM I WILL SEND TO YOU FROM THE FATHER THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH WHO PROCEEDS FROM THE FATHER HE WILL BEAR WITNESS ABOUT ME

AND YOU ALSO WILL BEAR WITNESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING

I HAVE SAID ALL THESE THINGS TO YOU TO KEEP YOU FROM FALLING AWAY

THEY WILL PUT YOU OUT OF THE SYNAGOGUES

INDEED THE HOUR IS COMING WHEN WHOEVER KILLS YOU WILL THINK HE IS OFFERING SERVICE TO GOD

AND THEY WILL DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THE FATHER NOR ME

BUT I HAVE SAID THESE THINGS TO YOU THAT WHEN THEIR HOUR COMES YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I TOLD THEM TO YOU

I DID NOT SAY THESE THINGS TO YOU FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I WAS WITH YOU

BUT NOW I AM GOING TO HIM WHO SENT ME AND NONE OF YOU ASKS ME 'WHERE ARE YOU GOING

' BUT BECAUSE I HAVE SAID THESE THINGS TO YOU SORROW HAS FILLED YOUR HEART

NEVERTHELESS I TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT IS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE THAT I GO AWAY FOR IF I DO NOT GO AWAY THE HELPER WILL NOT COME TO YOU

BUT IF I GO I WILL SEND HIM TO YOU

AND WHEN HE COMES HE WILL CONVICT THE WORLD CONCERNING SIN AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUDGMENT CONCERNING SIN BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN ME; CONCERNING RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE I GO TO THE FATHER AND YOU WILL SEE ME NO LONGER; CONCERNING JUDGMENT BECAUSE THE RULER OF THIS WORLD IS JUDGED

I STILL HAVE MANY THINGS TO SAY TO YOU BUT YOU CANNOT BEAR THEM NOW

WHEN THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH COMES HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL THE TRUTH FOR HE WILL NOT SPEAK ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY BUT WHATEVER HE HEARS HE WILL SPEAK AND HE WILL DECLARE TO YOU THE THINGS THAT ARE TO COME

HE WILL GLORIFY ME FOR HE WILL TAKE WHAT IS MINE AND DECLARE IT TO YOU

ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS IS MINE; THEREFORE I SAID THAT HE WILL TAKE WHAT IS MINE AND DECLARE IT TO YOU

A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL SEE ME NO LONGER; AND AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL SEE ME

 SO SOME OF HIS DISCIPLES SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS THIS THAT HE SAYS TO US 'A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL NOT SEE ME AND AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL SEE ME'; AND 'BECAUSE I AM GOING TO THE FATHER'

 SO THEY WERE SAYING WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY 'A LITTLE WHILE'

WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT

 JESUS KNEW THAT THEY WANTED TO ASK HIM SO HE SAID TO THEM IS THIS WHAT YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELVES WHAT I MEANT BY SAYING 'A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL NOT SEE ME AND AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE AND YOU WILL SEE ME'

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU YOU WILL WEEP AND LAMENT BUT THE WORLD WILL REJOICE

YOU WILL BE SORROWFUL BUT YOUR SORROW WILL TURN INTO JOY

WHEN A WOMAN IS GIVING BIRTH SHE HAS SORROW BECAUSE HER HOUR HAS COME BUT WHEN SHE HAS DELIVERED THE BABY SHE NO LONGER REMEMBERS THE ANGUISH FOR JOY THAT A HUMAN BEING HAS BEEN BORN INTO THE WORLD

SO ALSO YOU HAVE SORROW NOW BUT I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN AND YOUR HEARTS WILL REJOICE AND NO ONE WILL TAKE YOUR JOY FROM YOU

IN THAT DAY YOU WILL ASK NOTHING OF ME

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHATEVER YOU ASK OF THE FATHER IN MY NAME HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU

UNTIL NOW YOU HAVE ASKED NOTHING IN MY NAME

ASK AND YOU WILL RECEIVE THAT YOUR JOY MAY BE FULL

I HAVE SAID THESE THINGS TO YOU IN FIGURES OF SPEECH

THE HOUR IS COMING WHEN I WILL NO LONGER SPEAK TO YOU IN FIGURES OF SPEECH BUT WILL TELL YOU PLAINLY ABOUT THE FATHER

IN THAT DAY YOU WILL ASK IN MY NAME AND I DO NOT SAY TO YOU THAT I WILL ASK THE FATHER ON YOUR BEHALF; FOR THE FATHER HIMSELF LOVES YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOVED ME AND HAVE BELIEVED THAT I CAME FROM GOD

I CAME FROM THE FATHER AND HAVE COME INTO THE WORLD AND NOW I AM LEAVING THE WORLD AND GOING TO THE FATHER

 HIS DISCIPLES SAID AH NOW YOU ARE SPEAKING PLAINLY AND NOT USING FIGURATIVE SPEECH

NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL THINGS AND DO NOT NEED ANYONE TO QUESTION YOU; THIS IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT YOU CAME FROM GOD

 JESUS ANSWERED THEM DO YOU NOW BELIEVE

BEHOLD THE HOUR IS COMING INDEED IT HAS COME WHEN YOU WILL BE SCATTERED EACH TO HIS OWN HOME AND WILL LEAVE ME ALONE

YET I AM NOT ALONE FOR THE FATHER IS WITH ME

I HAVE SAID THESE THINGS TO YOU THAT IN ME YOU MAY HAVE PEACE

IN THE WORLD YOU WILL HAVE TRIBULATION

BUT TAKE HEART; I HAVE OVERCOME THE WORLD

WHEN JESUS HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN AND SAID FATHER THE HOUR HAS COME; GLORIFY YOUR SON THAT THE SON MAY GLORIFY YOU SINCE YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM AUTHORITY OVER ALL FLESH TO GIVE ETERNAL LIFE TO ALL WHOM YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM

AND THIS IS ETERNAL LIFE THAT THEY KNOW YOU THE ONLY TRUE GOD AND JESUS CHRIST WHOM YOU HAVE SENT

I GLORIFIED YOU ON EARTH HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THE WORK THAT YOU GAVE ME TO DO

AND NOW FATHER GLORIFY ME IN YOUR OWN PRESENCE WITH THE GLORY THAT I HAD WITH YOU BEFORE THE WORLD EXISTED

I HAVE MANIFESTED YOUR NAME TO THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU GAVE ME OUT OF THE WORLD

YOURS THEY WERE AND YOU GAVE THEM TO ME AND THEY HAVE KEPT YOUR WORD

NOW THEY KNOW THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME IS FROM YOU

FOR I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE WORDS THAT YOU GAVE ME AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEM AND HAVE COME TO KNOW IN TRUTH THAT I CAME FROM YOU; AND THEY HAVE BELIEVED THAT YOU SENT ME

I AM PRAYING FOR THEM

I AM NOT PRAYING FOR THE WORLD BUT FOR THOSE WHOM YOU HAVE GIVEN ME FOR THEY ARE YOURS

ALL MINE ARE YOURS AND YOURS ARE MINE AND I AM GLORIFIED IN THEM

AND I AM NO LONGER IN THE WORLD BUT THEY ARE IN THE WORLD AND I AM COMING TO YOU

HOLY FATHER KEEP THEM IN YOUR NAME WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THAT THEY MAY BE ONE EVEN AS WE ARE ONE

WHILE I WAS WITH THEM I KEPT THEM IN YOUR NAME WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME

I HAVE GUARDED THEM AND NOT ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN LOST EXCEPT THE SON OF DESTRUCTION THAT THE SCRIPTURE MIGHT BE FULFILLED

BUT NOW I AM COMING TO YOU AND THESE THINGS I SPEAK IN THE WORLD THAT THEY MAY HAVE MY JOY FULFILLED IN THEMSELVES

I HAVE GIVEN THEM YOUR WORD AND THE WORLD HAS HATED THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT OF THE WORLD JUST AS I AM NOT OF THE WORLD

I DO NOT ASK THAT YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE WORLD BUT THAT YOU KEEP THEM FROM THE EVIL ONE

THEY ARE NOT OF THE WORLD JUST AS I AM NOT OF THE WORLD

SANCTIFY THEM IN THE TRUTH; YOUR WORD IS TRUTH

AS YOU SENT ME INTO THE WORLD SO I HAVE SENT THEM INTO THE WORLD

AND FOR THEIR SAKE I CONSECRATE MYSELF THAT THEY ALSO MAY BE SANCTIFIED IN TRUTH

I DO NOT ASK FOR THESE ONLY BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO WILL BELIEVE IN ME THROUGH THEIR WORD THAT THEY MAY ALL BE ONE JUST AS YOU FATHER ARE IN ME AND I IN YOU THAT THEY ALSO MAY BE IN US SO THAT THE WORLD MAY BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE SENT ME

THE GLORY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME I HAVE GIVEN TO THEM THAT THEY MAY BE ONE EVEN AS WE ARE ONE I IN THEM AND YOU IN ME THAT THEY MAY BECOME PERFECTLY ONE SO THAT THE WORLD MAY KNOW THAT YOU SENT ME AND LOVED THEM EVEN AS YOU LOVED ME

FATHER I DESIRE THAT THEY ALSO WHOM YOU HAVE GIVEN ME MAY BE WITH ME WHERE I AM TO SEE MY GLORY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD

O RIGHTEOUS FATHER EVEN THOUGH THE WORLD DOES NOT KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU AND THESE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SENT ME

I MADE KNOWN TO THEM YOUR NAME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT THE LOVE WITH WHICH YOU HAVE LOVED ME MAY BE IN THEM AND I IN THEM

WHEN JESUS HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS HE WENT OUT WITH HIS DISCIPLES ACROSS THE KIDRON VALLEY WHERE THERE WAS A GARDEN WHICH HE AND HIS DISCIPLES ENTERED

NOW JUDAS WHO BETRAYED HIM ALSO KNEW THE PLACE FOR JESUS OFTEN MET THERE WITH HIS DISCIPLES

SO JUDAS HAVING PROCURED A BAND OF SOLDIERS AND SOME OFFICERS FROM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE PHARISEES WENT THERE WITH LANTERNS AND TORCHES AND WEAPONS

THEN JESUS KNOWING ALL THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO THEM WHOM DO YOU SEEK

 THEY ANSWERED HIM JESUS OF NAZARETH

 JESUS SAID TO THEM I AM HE

 JUDAS WHO BETRAYED HIM WAS STANDING WITH THEM

WHEN JESUS SAID TO THEM I AM HE THEY DREW BACK AND FELL TO THE GROUND

SO HE ASKED THEM AGAIN WHOM DO YOU SEEK

 AND THEY SAID JESUS OF NAZARETH

 JESUS ANSWERED I TOLD YOU THAT I AM HE

SO IF YOU SEEK ME LET THESE MEN GO

 THIS WAS TO FULFILL THE WORD THAT HE HAD SPOKEN OF THOSE WHOM YOU GAVE ME I HAVE LOST NOT ONE

 THEN SIMON PETER HAVING A SWORD DREW IT AND STRUCK THE HIGH PRIEST'S SERVANT AND CUT OFF HIS RIGHT EAR

THE SERVANT'S NAME WAS MALCHUS

 SO JESUS SAID TO PETER PUT YOUR SWORD INTO ITS SHEATH; SHALL I NOT DRINK THE CUP THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN ME

 SO THE BAND OF SOLDIERS AND THEIR CAPTAIN AND THE OFFICERS OF THE JEWS ARRESTED JESUS AND BOUND HIM

FIRST THEY LED HIM TO ANNAS FOR HE WAS THE FATHERINLAW OF CAIAPHAS WHO WAS HIGH PRIEST THAT YEAR

IT WAS CAIAPHAS WHO HAD ADVISED THE JEWS THAT IT WOULD BE EXPEDIENT THAT ONE MAN SHOULD DIE FOR THE PEOPLE

SIMON PETER FOLLOWED JESUS AND SO DID ANOTHER DISCIPLE

SINCE THAT DISCIPLE WAS KNOWN TO THE HIGH PRIEST HE ENTERED WITH JESUS INTO THE COURT OF THE HIGH PRIEST BUT PETER STOOD OUTSIDE AT THE DOOR

SO THE OTHER DISCIPLE WHO WAS KNOWN TO THE HIGH PRIEST WENT OUT AND SPOKE TO THE SERVANT GIRL WHO KEPT WATCH AT THE DOOR AND BROUGHT PETER IN

THE SERVANT GIRL AT THE DOOR SAID TO PETER YOU ALSO ARE NOT ONE OF THIS MAN'S DISCIPLES ARE YOU

 HE SAID I AM NOT

 NOW THE SERVANTS AND OFFICERS HAD MADE A CHARCOAL FIRE BECAUSE IT WAS COLD AND THEY WERE STANDING AND WARMING THEMSELVES

PETER ALSO WAS WITH THEM STANDING AND WARMING HIMSELF

THE HIGH PRIEST THEN QUESTIONED JESUS ABOUT HIS DISCIPLES AND HIS TEACHING

JESUS ANSWERED HIM I HAVE SPOKEN OPENLY TO THE WORLD

I HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT IN SYNAGOGUES AND IN THE TEMPLE WHERE ALL JEWS COME TOGETHER

I HAVE SAID NOTHING IN SECRET

WHY DO YOU ASK ME

ASK THOSE WHO HAVE HEARD ME WHAT I SAID TO THEM; THEY KNOW WHAT I SAID

 WHEN HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS ONE OF THE OFFICERS STANDING BY STRUCK JESUS WITH HIS HAND SAYING IS THAT HOW YOU ANSWER THE HIGH PRIEST

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM IF WHAT I SAID IS WRONG BEAR WITNESS ABOUT THE WRONG; BUT IF WHAT I SAID IS RIGHT WHY DO YOU STRIKE ME

 ANNAS THEN SENT HIM BOUND TO CAIAPHAS THE HIGH PRIEST

NOW SIMON PETER WAS STANDING AND WARMING HIMSELF

SO THEY SAID TO HIM YOU ALSO ARE NOT ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES ARE YOU

 HE DENIED IT AND SAID I AM NOT

 ONE OF THE SERVANTS OF THE HIGH PRIEST A RELATIVE OF THE MAN WHOSE EAR PETER HAD CUT OFF ASKED DID I NOT SEE YOU IN THE GARDEN WITH HIM

 PETER AGAIN DENIED IT AND AT ONCE A ROOSTER CROWED

THEN THEY LED JESUS FROM THE HOUSE OF CAIAPHAS TO THE GOVERNOR'S HEADQUARTERS

IT WAS EARLY MORNING

THEY THEMSELVES DID NOT ENTER THE GOVERNOR'S HEADQUARTERS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE DEFILED BUT COULD EAT THE PASSOVER

SO PILATE WENT OUTSIDE TO THEM AND SAID WHAT ACCUSATION DO YOU BRING AGAINST THIS MAN

 THEY ANSWERED HIM IF THIS MAN WERE NOT DOING EVIL WE WOULD NOT HAVE DELIVERED HIM OVER TO YOU

 PILATE SAID TO THEM TAKE HIM YOURSELVES AND JUDGE HIM BY YOUR OWN LAW

 THE JEWS SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR US TO PUT ANYONE TO DEATH

 THIS WAS TO FULFILL THE WORD THAT JESUS HAD SPOKEN TO SHOW BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WAS GOING TO DIE

SO PILATE ENTERED HIS HEADQUARTERS AGAIN AND CALLED JESUS AND SAID TO HIM ARE YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 JESUS ANSWERED DO YOU SAY THIS OF YOUR OWN ACCORD OR DID OTHERS SAY IT TO YOU ABOUT ME

 PILATE ANSWERED AM I A JEW

YOUR OWN NATION AND THE CHIEF PRIESTS HAVE DELIVERED YOU OVER TO ME

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

 JESUS ANSWERED MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD

IF MY KINGDOM WERE OF THIS WORLD MY SERVANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THAT I MIGHT NOT BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE JEWS

BUT MY KINGDOM IS NOT FROM THE WORLD

 THEN PILATE SAID TO HIM SO YOU ARE A KING

 JESUS ANSWERED YOU SAY THAT I AM A KING

FOR THIS PURPOSE I WAS BORN AND FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE COME INTO THE WORLDTO BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH

EVERYONE WHO IS OF THE TRUTH LISTENS TO MY VOICE

 PILATE SAID TO HIM WHAT IS TRUTH

AFTER HE HAD SAID THIS HE WENT BACK OUTSIDE TO THE JEWS AND TOLD THEM I FIND NO GUILT IN HIM

BUT YOU HAVE A CUSTOM THAT I SHOULD RELEASE ONE MAN FOR YOU AT THE PASSOVER

SO DO YOU WANT ME TO RELEASE TO YOU THE KING OF THE JEWS

 THEY CRIED OUT AGAIN NOT THIS MAN BUT BARABBAS

 NOW BARABBAS WAS A ROBBER

THEN PILATE TOOK JESUS AND FLOGGED HIM

AND THE SOLDIERS TWISTED TOGETHER A CROWN OF THORNS AND PUT IT ON HIS HEAD AND ARRAYED HIM IN A PURPLE ROBE

THEY CAME UP TO HIM SAYING HAIL KING OF THE JEWS

 AND STRUCK HIM WITH THEIR HANDS

PILATE WENT OUT AGAIN AND SAID TO THEM SEE I AM BRINGING HIM OUT TO YOU THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I FIND NO GUILT IN HIM

 SO JESUS CAME OUT WEARING THE CROWN OF THORNS AND THE PURPLE ROBE

PILATE SAID TO THEM BEHOLD THE MAN

 WHEN THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE OFFICERS SAW HIM THEY CRIED OUT CRUCIFY HIM CRUCIFY HIM

 PILATE SAID TO THEM TAKE HIM YOURSELVES AND CRUCIFY HIM FOR I FIND NO GUILT IN HIM

 THE JEWS ANSWERED HIM WE HAVE A LAW AND ACCORDING TO THAT LAW HE OUGHT TO DIE BECAUSE HE HAS MADE HIMSELF THE SON OF GOD

 WHEN PILATE HEARD THIS STATEMENT HE WAS EVEN MORE AFRAID

HE ENTERED HIS HEADQUARTERS AGAIN AND SAID TO JESUS WHERE ARE YOU FROM

 BUT JESUS GAVE HIM NO ANSWER

SO PILATE SAID TO HIM YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE AUTHORITY TO RELEASE YOU AND AUTHORITY TO CRUCIFY YOU

 JESUS ANSWERED HIM YOU WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER ME AT ALL UNLESS IT HAD BEEN GIVEN YOU FROM ABOVE

THEREFORE HE WHO DELIVERED ME OVER TO YOU HAS THE GREATER SIN

 FROM THEN ON PILATE SOUGHT TO RELEASE HIM BUT THE JEWS CRIED OUT IF YOU RELEASE THIS MAN YOU ARE NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND

EVERYONE WHO MAKES HIMSELF A KING OPPOSES CAESAR

 SO WHEN PILATE HEARD THESE WORDS HE BROUGHT JESUS OUT AND SAT DOWN ON THE JUDGMENT SEAT AT A PLACE CALLED THE STONE PAVEMENT AND IN ARAMAIC GABBATHA

NOW IT WAS THE DAY OF PREPARATION OF THE PASSOVER

IT WAS ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR

HE SAID TO THE JEWS BEHOLD YOUR KING

 THEY CRIED OUT AWAY WITH HIM AWAY WITH HIM CRUCIFY HIM

 PILATE SAID TO THEM SHALL I CRUCIFY YOUR KING

 THE CHIEF PRIESTS ANSWERED

WE HAVE NO KING BUT CAESAR

 SO HE DELIVERED HIM OVER TO THEM TO BE CRUCIFIED

SO THEY TOOK JESUS AND HE WENT OUT BEARING HIS OWN CROSS TO THE PLACE CALLED THE PLACE OF A SKULL WHICH IN ARAMAIC IS CALLED GOLGOTHA

THERE THEY CRUCIFIED HIM AND WITH HIM TWO OTHERS ONE ON EITHER SIDE AND JESUS BETWEEN THEM

PILATE ALSO WROTE AN INSCRIPTION AND PUT IT ON THE CROSS

IT READ JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS

 MANY OF THE JEWS READ THIS INSCRIPTION FOR THE PLACE WHERE JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED WAS NEAR THE CITY AND IT WAS WRITTEN IN ARAMAIC IN LATIN AND IN GREEK

SO THE CHIEF PRIESTS OF THE JEWS SAID TO PILATE DO NOT WRITE 'THE KING OF THE JEWS' BUT RATHER 'THIS MAN SAID I AM KING OF THE JEWS

' PILATE ANSWERED WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN I HAVE WRITTEN

 WHEN THE SOLDIERS HAD CRUCIFIED JESUS THEY TOOK HIS GARMENTS AND DIVIDED THEM INTO FOUR PARTS ONE PART FOR EACH SOLDIER; ALSO HIS TUNIC

BUT THE TUNIC WAS SEAMLESS WOVEN IN ONE PIECE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET US NOT TEAR IT BUT CAST LOTS FOR IT TO SEE WHOSE IT SHALL BE

 THIS WAS TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE WHICH SAYS THEY DIVIDED MY GARMENTS AMONG THEM AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS

SO THE SOLDIERS DID THESE THINGS BUT STANDING BY THE CROSS OF JESUS WERE HIS MOTHER AND HIS MOTHER'S SISTER MARY THE WIFE OF CLOPAS AND MARY MAGDALENE

WHEN JESUS SAW HIS MOTHER AND THE DISCIPLE WHOM HE LOVED STANDING NEARBY HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER WOMAN BEHOLD YOUR SON

 THEN HE SAID TO THE DISCIPLE BEHOLD YOUR MOTHER

 AND FROM THAT HOUR THE DISCIPLE TOOK HER TO HIS OWN HOME

AFTER THIS JESUS KNOWING THAT ALL WAS NOW FINISHED SAID TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE I THIRST

 A JAR FULL OF SOUR WINE STOOD THERE SO THEY PUT A SPONGE FULL OF THE SOUR WINE ON A HYSSOP BRANCH AND HELD IT TO HIS MOUTH

WHEN JESUS HAD RECEIVED THE SOUR WINE HE SAID IT IS FINISHED AND HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND GAVE UP HIS SPIRIT

SINCE IT WAS THE DAY OF PREPARATION AND SO THAT THE BODIES WOULD NOT REMAIN ON THE CROSS ON THE SABBATH FOR THAT SABBATH WAS A HIGH DAY THE JEWS ASKED PILATE THAT THEIR LEGS MIGHT BE BROKEN AND THAT THEY MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY

SO THE SOLDIERS CAME AND BROKE THE LEGS OF THE FIRST AND OF THE OTHER WHO HAD BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH HIM

BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO JESUS AND SAW THAT HE WAS ALREADY DEAD THEY DID NOT BREAK HIS LEGS

BUT ONE OF THE SOLDIERS PIERCED HIS SIDE WITH A SPEAR AND AT ONCE THERE CAME OUT BLOOD AND WATER

HE WHO SAW IT HAS BORNE WITNESSHIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE AND HE KNOWS THAT HE IS TELLING THE TRUTHTHAT YOU ALSO MAY BELIEVE

FOR THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE THAT THE SCRIPTURE MIGHT BE FULFILLED NOT ONE OF HIS BONES WILL BE BROKEN

 AND AGAIN ANOTHER SCRIPTURE SAYS THEY WILL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY HAVE PIERCED

 AFTER THESE THINGS JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA WHO WAS A DISCIPLE OF JESUS BUT SECRETLY FOR FEAR OF THE JEWS ASKED PILATE THAT HE MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE BODY OF JESUS AND PILATE GAVE HIM PERMISSION

SO HE CAME AND TOOK AWAY HIS BODY

NICODEMUS ALSO WHO EARLIER HAD COME TO JESUS BY NIGHT CAME BRINGING A MIXTURE OF MYRRH AND ALOES ABOUT SEVENTYFIVE POUNDS IN WEIGHT

SO THEY TOOK THE BODY OF JESUS AND BOUND IT IN LINEN CLOTHS WITH THE SPICES AS IS THE BURIAL CUSTOM OF THE JEWS

NOW IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS CRUCIFIED THERE WAS A GARDEN AND IN THE GARDEN A NEW TOMB IN WHICH NO ONE HAD YET BEEN LAID

SO BECAUSE OF THE JEWISH DAY OF PREPARATION SINCE THE TOMB WAS CLOSE AT HAND THEY LAID JESUS THERE

NOW ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK MARY MAGDALENE CAME TO THE TOMB EARLY WHILE IT WAS STILL DARK AND SAW THAT THE STONE HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE TOMB

SO SHE RAN AND WENT TO SIMON PETER AND THE OTHER DISCIPLE THE ONE WHOM JESUS LOVED AND SAID TO THEM THEY HAVE TAKEN THE LORD OUT OF THE TOMB AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE LAID HIM

 SO PETER WENT OUT WITH THE OTHER DISCIPLE AND THEY WERE GOING TOWARD THE TOMB

BOTH OF THEM WERE RUNNING TOGETHER BUT THE OTHER DISCIPLE OUTRAN PETER AND REACHED THE TOMB FIRST

AND STOOPING TO LOOK IN HE SAW THE LINEN CLOTHS LYING THERE BUT HE DID NOT GO IN

THEN SIMON PETER CAME FOLLOWING HIM AND WENT INTO THE TOMB

HE SAW THE LINEN CLOTHS LYING THERE AND THE FACE CLOTH WHICH HAD BEEN ON JESUS' HEAD NOT LYING WITH THE LINEN CLOTHS BUT FOLDED UP IN A PLACE BY ITSELF

THEN THE OTHER DISCIPLE WHO HAD REACHED THE TOMB FIRST ALSO WENT IN AND HE SAW AND BELIEVED; FOR AS YET THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURE THAT HE MUST RISE FROM THE DEAD

THEN THE DISCIPLES WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES

BUT MARY STOOD WEEPING OUTSIDE THE TOMB AND AS SHE WEPT SHE STOOPED TO LOOK INTO THE TOMB

AND SHE SAW TWO ANGELS IN WHITE SITTING WHERE THE BODY OF JESUS HAD LAIN ONE AT THE HEAD AND ONE AT THE FEET

THEY SAID TO HER WOMAN WHY ARE YOU WEEPING

 SHE SAID TO THEM THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY LORD AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE LAID HIM

 HAVING SAID THIS SHE TURNED AROUND AND SAW JESUS STANDING BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS JESUS

JESUS SAID TO HER WOMAN WHY ARE YOU WEEPING

WHOM ARE YOU SEEKING

 SUPPOSING HIM TO BE THE GARDENER SHE SAID TO HIM SIR IF YOU HAVE CARRIED HIM AWAY TELL ME WHERE YOU HAVE LAID HIM AND I WILL TAKE HIM AWAY

 JESUS SAID TO HER MARY

 SHE TURNED AND SAID TO HIM IN ARAMAIC RABBONI

 WHICH MEANS TEACHER

JESUS SAID TO HER DO NOT CLING TO ME FOR I HAVE NOT YET ASCENDED TO THE FATHER; BUT GO TO MY BROTHERS AND SAY TO THEM 'I AM ASCENDING TO MY FATHER AND YOUR FATHER TO MY GOD AND YOUR GOD

' MARY MAGDALENE WENT AND ANNOUNCED TO THE DISCIPLES I HAVE SEEN THE LORDAND THAT HE HAD SAID THESE THINGS TO HER

ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK THE DOORS BEING LOCKED WHERE THE DISCIPLES WERE FOR FEAR OF THE JEWS JESUS CAME AND STOOD AMONG THEM AND SAID TO THEM PEACE BE WITH YOU

 WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE SHOWED THEM HIS HANDS AND HIS SIDE

THEN THE DISCIPLES WERE GLAD WHEN THEY SAW THE LORD

JESUS SAID TO THEM AGAIN PEACE BE WITH YOU

AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME EVEN SO I AM SENDING YOU

 AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE BREATHED ON THEM AND SAID TO THEM RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT

IF YOU FORGIVE THE SINS OF ANYONE THEY ARE FORGIVEN; IF YOU WITHHOLD FORGIVENESS FROM ANYONE IT IS WITHHELD

 NOW THOMAS ONE OF THE TWELVE CALLED THE TWIN WAS NOT WITH THEM WHEN JESUS CAME

SO THE OTHER DISCIPLES TOLD HIM WE HAVE SEEN THE LORD

 BUT HE SAID TO THEM UNLESS I SEE IN HIS HANDS THE MARK OF THE NAILS AND PLACE MY FINGER INTO THE MARK OF THE NAILS AND PLACE MY HAND INTO HIS SIDE I WILL NEVER BELIEVE

 EIGHT DAYS LATER HIS DISCIPLES WERE INSIDE AGAIN AND THOMAS WAS WITH THEM

ALTHOUGH THE DOORS WERE LOCKED JESUS CAME AND STOOD AMONG THEM AND SAID PEACE BE WITH YOU

 THEN HE SAID TO THOMAS PUT YOUR FINGER HERE AND SEE MY HANDS; AND PUT OUT YOUR HAND AND PLACE IT IN MY SIDE

DO NOT DISBELIEVE BUT BELIEVE

 THOMAS ANSWERED HIM MY LORD AND MY GOD

 JESUS SAID TO HIM HAVE YOU BELIEVED BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN ME

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN AND YET HAVE BELIEVED

 NOW JESUS DID MANY OTHER SIGNS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DISCIPLES WHICH ARE NOT WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK; BUT THESE ARE WRITTEN SO THAT YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST THE SON OF GOD AND THAT BY BELIEVING YOU MAY HAVE LIFE IN HIS NAME

AFTER THIS JESUS REVEALED HIMSELF AGAIN TO THE DISCIPLES BY THE SEA OF TIBERIAS AND HE REVEALED HIMSELF IN THIS WAY

SIMON PETER THOMAS CALLED THE TWIN NATHANAEL OF CANA IN GALILEE THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE AND TWO OTHERS OF HIS DISCIPLES WERE TOGETHER

SIMON PETER SAID TO THEM I AM GOING FISHING

 THEY SAID TO HIM WE WILL GO WITH YOU

 THEY WENT OUT AND GOT INTO THE BOAT BUT THAT NIGHT THEY CAUGHT NOTHING

JUST AS DAY WAS BREAKING JESUS STOOD ON THE SHORE; YET THE DISCIPLES DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS JESUS

JESUS SAID TO THEM CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE ANY FISH

 THEY ANSWERED HIM NO

 HE SAID TO THEM CAST THE NET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOAT AND YOU WILL FIND SOME

 SO THEY CAST IT AND NOW THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO HAUL IT IN BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF FISH

THAT DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED THEREFORE SAID TO PETER IT IS THE LORD

 WHEN SIMON PETER HEARD THAT IT WAS THE LORD HE PUT ON HIS OUTER GARMENT FOR HE WAS STRIPPED FOR WORK AND THREW HIMSELF INTO THE SEA

THE OTHER DISCIPLES CAME IN THE BOAT DRAGGING THE NET FULL OF FISH FOR THEY WERE NOT FAR FROM THE LAND BUT ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF

WHEN THEY GOT OUT ON LAND THEY SAW A CHARCOAL FIRE IN PLACE WITH FISH LAID OUT ON IT AND BREAD

JESUS SAID TO THEM BRING SOME OF THE FISH THAT YOU HAVE JUST CAUGHT

 SO SIMON PETER WENT ABOARD AND HAULED THE NET ASHORE FULL OF LARGE FISH  OF THEM

AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SO MANY THE NET WAS NOT TORN

JESUS SAID TO THEM COME AND HAVE BREAKFAST

 NOW NONE OF THE DISCIPLES DARED ASK HIM WHO ARE YOU

 THEY KNEW IT WAS THE LORD

JESUS CAME AND TOOK THE BREAD AND GAVE IT TO THEM AND SO WITH THE FISH

THIS WAS NOW THE THIRD TIME THAT JESUS WAS REVEALED TO THE DISCIPLES AFTER HE WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD

WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED BREAKFAST JESUS SAID TO SIMON PETER SIMON SON OF JOHN DO YOU LOVE ME MORE THAN THESE

 HE SAID TO HIM YES LORD; YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

 HE SAID TO HIM FEED MY LAMBS

 HE SAID TO HIM A SECOND TIME SIMON SON OF JOHN DO YOU LOVE ME

 HE SAID TO HIM YES LORD; YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

 HE SAID TO HIM TEND MY SHEEP

 HE SAID TO HIM THE THIRD TIME SIMON SON OF JOHN DO YOU LOVE ME

 PETER WAS GRIEVED BECAUSE HE SAID TO HIM THE THIRD TIME DO YOU LOVE ME

 AND HE SAID TO HIM LORD YOU KNOW EVERYTHING; YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

 JESUS SAID TO HIM FEED MY SHEEP

TRULY TRULY I SAY TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG YOU USED TO DRESS YOURSELF AND WALK WHEREVER YOU WANTED BUT WHEN YOU ARE OLD YOU WILL STRETCH OUT YOUR HANDS AND ANOTHER WILL DRESS YOU AND CARRY YOU WHERE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO

 THIS HE SAID TO SHOW BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WAS TO GLORIFY GOD

 AND AFTER SAYING THIS HE SAID TO HIM FOLLOW ME

 PETER TURNED AND SAW THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED FOLLOWING THEM THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN RECLINING AT TABLE CLOSE TO HIM AND HAD SAID LORD WHO IS IT THAT IS GOING TO BETRAY YOU

 WHEN PETER SAW HIM HE SAID TO JESUS LORD WHAT ABOUT THIS MAN

 JESUS SAID TO HIM IF IT IS MY WILL THAT HE REMAIN UNTIL I COME WHAT IS THAT TO YOU

YOU FOLLOW ME

 SO THE SAYING SPREAD ABROAD AMONG THE BROTHERS THAT THIS DISCIPLE WAS NOT TO DIE; YET JESUS DID NOT SAY TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT TO DIE BUT IF IT IS MY WILL THAT HE REMAIN UNTIL I COME WHAT IS THAT TO YOU

 THIS IS THE DISCIPLE WHO IS BEARING WITNESS ABOUT THESE THINGS AND WHO HAS WRITTEN THESE THINGS AND WE KNOW THAT HIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE

NOW THERE ARE ALSO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT JESUS DID

WERE EVERY ONE OF THEM TO BE WRITTEN I SUPPOSE THAT THE WORLD ITSELF COULD NOT CONTAIN THE BOOKS THAT WOULD BE WRITTEN

 JOHNTHAT WHICH WAS FROM THE BEGINNING WHICH WE HAVE HEARD WHICH WE HAVE SEEN WITH OUR EYES WHICH WE LOOKED UPON AND HAVE TOUCHED WITH OUR HANDS CONCERNING THE WORD OF LIFE THE LIFE WAS MADE MANIFEST AND WE HAVE SEEN IT AND TESTIFY TO IT AND PROCLAIM TO YOU THE ETERNAL LIFE WHICH WAS WITH THE FATHER AND WAS MADE MANIFEST TO US THAT WHICH WE HAVE SEEN AND HEARD WE PROCLAIM ALSO TO YOU SO THAT YOU TOO MAY HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH US; AND INDEED OUR FELLOWSHIP IS WITH THE FATHER AND WITH HIS SON JESUS CHRIST

AND WE ARE WRITING THESE THINGS SO THAT OUR JOY MAY BE COMPLETE

THIS IS THE MESSAGE WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIM AND PROCLAIM TO YOU THAT GOD IS LIGHT AND IN HIM IS NO DARKNESS AT ALL

IF WE SAY WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM WHILE WE WALK IN DARKNESS WE LIE AND DO NOT PRACTICE THE TRUTH

BUT IF WE WALK IN THE LIGHT AS HE IS IN THE LIGHT WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THE BLOOD OF JESUS HIS SON CLEANSES US FROM ALL SIN

IF WE SAY WE HAVE NO SIN WE DECEIVE OURSELVES AND THE TRUTH IS NOT IN US

IF WE CONFESS OUR SINS HE IS FAITHFUL AND JUST TO FORGIVE US OUR SINS AND TO CLEANSE US FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS

IF WE SAY WE HAVE NOT SINNED WE MAKE HIM A LIAR AND HIS WORD IS NOT IN US

MY LITTLE CHILDREN I AM WRITING THESE THINGS TO YOU SO THAT YOU MAY NOT SIN

BUT IF ANYONE DOES SIN WE HAVE AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER JESUS CHRIST THE RIGHTEOUS

HE IS THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS AND NOT FOR OURS ONLY BUT ALSO FOR THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD

AND BY THIS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE COME TO KNOW HIM IF WE KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS

WHOEVER SAYS I KNOW HIM BUT DOES NOT KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND THE TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM BUT WHOEVER KEEPS HIS WORD IN HIM TRULY THE LOVE OF GOD IS PERFECTED

BY THIS WE MAY BE SURE THAT WE ARE IN HIM WHOEVER SAYS HE ABIDES IN HIM OUGHT TO WALK IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH HE WALKED

BELOVED I AM WRITING YOU NO NEW COMMANDMENT BUT AN OLD COMMANDMENT THAT YOU HAD FROM THE BEGINNING

THE OLD COMMANDMENT IS THE WORD THAT YOU HAVE HEARD

AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A NEW COMMANDMENT THAT I AM WRITING TO YOU WHICH IS TRUE IN HIM AND IN YOU BECAUSE THE DARKNESS IS PASSING AWAY AND THE TRUE LIGHT IS ALREADY SHINING

WHOEVER SAYS HE IS IN THE LIGHT AND HATES HIS BROTHER IS STILL IN DARKNESS

WHOEVER LOVES HIS BROTHER ABIDES IN THE LIGHT AND IN HIM THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR STUMBLING

BUT WHOEVER HATES HIS BROTHER IS IN THE DARKNESS AND WALKS IN THE DARKNESS AND DOES NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS GOING BECAUSE THE DARKNESS HAS BLINDED HIS EYES

I AM WRITING TO YOU LITTLE CHILDREN BECAUSE YOUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE

I AM WRITING TO YOU FATHERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM WHO IS FROM THE BEGINNING

I AM WRITING TO YOU YOUNG MEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE OVERCOME THE EVIL ONE

I WRITE TO YOU CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE FATHER

I WRITE TO YOU FATHERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM WHO IS FROM THE BEGINNING

I WRITE TO YOU YOUNG MEN BECAUSE YOU ARE STRONG AND THE WORD OF GOD ABIDES IN YOU AND YOU HAVE OVERCOME THE EVIL ONE

DO NOT LOVE THE WORLD OR THE THINGS IN THE WORLD

IF ANYONE LOVES THE WORLD THE LOVE OF THE FATHER IS NOT IN HIM

FOR ALL THAT IS IN THE WORLDTHE DESIRES OF THE FLESH AND THE DESIRES OF THE EYES AND PRIDE IN POSSESSIONSIS NOT FROM THE FATHER BUT IS FROM THE WORLD

AND THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY ALONG WITH ITS DESIRES BUT WHOEVER DOES THE WILL OF GOD ABIDES FOREVER

CHILDREN IT IS THE LAST HOUR AND AS YOU HAVE HEARD THAT ANTICHRIST IS COMING SO NOW MANY ANTICHRISTS HAVE COME

THEREFORE WE KNOW THAT IT IS THE LAST HOUR

THEY WENT OUT FROM US BUT THEY WERE NOT OF US; FOR IF THEY HAD BEEN OF US THEY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED WITH US

BUT THEY WENT OUT THAT IT MIGHT BECOME PLAIN THAT THEY ALL ARE NOT OF US

BUT YOU HAVE BEEN ANOINTED BY THE HOLY ONE AND YOU ALL HAVE KNOWLEDGE

I WRITE TO YOU NOT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH BUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT AND BECAUSE NO LIE IS OF THE TRUTH

WHO IS THE LIAR BUT HE WHO DENIES THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST

THIS IS THE ANTICHRIST HE WHO DENIES THE FATHER AND THE SON

NO ONE WHO DENIES THE SON HAS THE FATHER

WHOEVER CONFESSES THE SON HAS THE FATHER ALSO

LET WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE BEGINNING ABIDE IN YOU

IF WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE BEGINNING ABIDES IN YOU THEN YOU TOO WILL ABIDE IN THE SON AND IN THE FATHER

AND THIS IS THE PROMISE THAT HE MADE TO USETERNAL LIFE

I WRITE THESE THINGS TO YOU ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DECEIVE YOU

BUT THE ANOINTING THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM HIM ABIDES IN YOU AND YOU HAVE NO NEED THAT ANYONE SHOULD TEACH YOU

BUT AS HIS ANOINTING TEACHES YOU ABOUT EVERYTHINGAND IS TRUE AND IS NO LIE JUST AS IT HAS TAUGHT YOUABIDE IN HIM

AND NOW LITTLE CHILDREN ABIDE IN HIM SO THAT WHEN HE APPEARS WE MAY HAVE CONFIDENCE AND NOT SHRINK FROM HIM IN SHAME AT HIS COMING

IF YOU KNOW THAT HE IS RIGHTEOUS YOU MAY BE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO PRACTICES RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS BEEN BORN OF HIM

SEE WHAT KIND OF LOVE THE FATHER HAS GIVEN TO US THAT WE SHOULD BE CALLED CHILDREN OF GOD; AND SO WE ARE

THE REASON WHY THE WORLD DOES NOT KNOW US IS THAT IT DID NOT KNOW HIM

BELOVED WE ARE GOD'S CHILDREN NOW AND WHAT WE WILL BE HAS NOT YET APPEARED; BUT WE KNOW THAT WHEN HE APPEARS WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM BECAUSE WE SHALL SEE HIM AS HE IS

AND EVERYONE WHO THUS HOPES IN HIM PURIFIES HIMSELF AS HE IS PURE

EVERYONE WHO MAKES A PRACTICE OF SINNING ALSO PRACTICES LAWLESSNESS; SIN IS LAWLESSNESS

YOU KNOW THAT HE APPEARED TO TAKE AWAY SINS AND IN HIM THERE IS NO SIN

NO ONE WHO ABIDES IN HIM KEEPS ON SINNING; NO ONE WHO KEEPS ON SINNING HAS EITHER SEEN HIM OR KNOWN HIM

LITTLE CHILDREN LET NO ONE DECEIVE YOU

WHOEVER PRACTICES RIGHTEOUSNESS IS RIGHTEOUS AS HE IS RIGHTEOUS

WHOEVER MAKES A PRACTICE OF SINNING IS OF THE DEVIL FOR THE DEVIL HAS BEEN SINNING FROM THE BEGINNING

THE REASON THE SON OF GOD APPEARED WAS TO DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL

NO ONE BORN OF GOD MAKES A PRACTICE OF SINNING FOR GOD'S SEED ABIDES IN HIM AND HE CANNOT KEEP ON SINNING BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN BORN OF GOD

BY THIS IT IS EVIDENT WHO ARE THE CHILDREN OF GOD AND WHO ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL WHOEVER DOES NOT PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT OF GOD NOR IS THE ONE WHO DOES NOT LOVE HIS BROTHER

FOR THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WE SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER

WE SHOULD NOT BE LIKE CAIN WHO WAS OF THE EVIL ONE AND MURDERED HIS BROTHER

AND WHY DID HE MURDER HIM

BECAUSE HIS OWN DEEDS WERE EVIL AND HIS BROTHER'S RIGHTEOUS

DO NOT BE SURPRISED BROTHERS THAT THE WORLD HATES YOU

WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED OUT OF DEATH INTO LIFE BECAUSE WE LOVE THE BROTHERS

WHOEVER DOES NOT LOVE ABIDES IN DEATH

EVERYONE WHO HATES HIS BROTHER IS A MURDERER AND YOU KNOW THAT NO MURDERER HAS ETERNAL LIFE ABIDING IN HIM

BY THIS WE KNOW LOVE THAT HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR US AND WE OUGHT TO LAY DOWN OUR LIVES FOR THE BROTHERS

BUT IF ANYONE HAS THE WORLD'S GOODS AND SEES HIS BROTHER IN NEED YET CLOSES HIS HEART AGAINST HIM HOW DOES GOD'S LOVE ABIDE IN HIM

LITTLE CHILDREN LET US NOT LOVE IN WORD OR TALK BUT IN DEED AND IN TRUTH

BY THIS WE SHALL KNOW THAT WE ARE OF THE TRUTH AND REASSURE OUR HEART BEFORE HIM; FOR WHENEVER OUR HEART CONDEMNS US GOD IS GREATER THAN OUR HEART AND HE KNOWS EVERYTHING

BELOVED IF OUR HEART DOES NOT CONDEMN US WE HAVE CONFIDENCE BEFORE GOD; AND WHATEVER WE ASK WE RECEIVE FROM HIM BECAUSE WE KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND DO WHAT PLEASES HIM

AND THIS IS HIS COMMANDMENT THAT WE BELIEVE IN THE NAME OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER JUST AS HE HAS COMMANDED US

WHOEVER KEEPS HIS COMMANDMENTS ABIDES IN HIM AND HE IN THEM

AND BY THIS WE KNOW THAT HE ABIDES IN US BY THE SPIRIT WHOM HE HAS GIVEN US

BELOVED DO NOT BELIEVE EVERY SPIRIT BUT TEST THE SPIRITS TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE FROM GOD FOR MANY FALSE PROPHETS HAVE GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD

BY THIS YOU KNOW THE SPIRIT OF GOD EVERY SPIRIT THAT CONFESSES THAT JESUS CHRIST HAS COME IN THE FLESH IS FROM GOD AND EVERY SPIRIT THAT DOES NOT CONFESS JESUS IS NOT FROM GOD

THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF THE ANTICHRIST WHICH YOU HEARD WAS COMING AND NOW IS IN THE WORLD ALREADY

LITTLE CHILDREN YOU ARE FROM GOD AND HAVE OVERCOME THEM FOR HE WHO IS IN YOU IS GREATER THAN HE WHO IS IN THE WORLD

THEY ARE FROM THE WORLD; THEREFORE THEY SPEAK FROM THE WORLD AND THE WORLD LISTENS TO THEM

WE ARE FROM GOD

WHOEVER KNOWS GOD LISTENS TO US; WHOEVER IS NOT FROM GOD DOES NOT LISTEN TO US

BY THIS WE KNOW THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH AND THE SPIRIT OF ERROR

BELOVED LET US LOVE ONE ANOTHER FOR LOVE IS FROM GOD AND WHOEVER LOVES HAS BEEN BORN OF GOD AND KNOWS GOD

ANYONE WHO DOES NOT LOVE DOES NOT KNOW GOD BECAUSE GOD IS LOVE

IN THIS THE LOVE OF GOD WAS MADE MANIFEST AMONG US THAT GOD SENT HIS ONLY SON INTO THE WORLD SO THAT WE MIGHT LIVE THROUGH HIM

IN THIS IS LOVE NOT THAT WE HAVE LOVED GOD BUT THAT HE LOVED US AND SENT HIS SON TO BE THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS

BELOVED IF GOD SO LOVED US WE ALSO OUGHT TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER

NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN GOD; IF WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER GOD ABIDES IN US AND HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US

BY THIS WE KNOW THAT WE ABIDE IN HIM AND HE IN US BECAUSE HE HAS GIVEN US OF HIS SPIRIT

AND WE HAVE SEEN AND TESTIFY THAT THE FATHER HAS SENT HIS SON TO BE THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD

WHOEVER CONFESSES THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD GOD ABIDES IN HIM AND HE IN GOD

SO WE HAVE COME TO KNOW AND TO BELIEVE THE LOVE THAT GOD HAS FOR US

GOD IS LOVE AND WHOEVER ABIDES IN LOVE ABIDES IN GOD AND GOD ABIDES IN HIM

BY THIS IS LOVE PERFECTED WITH US SO THAT WE MAY HAVE CONFIDENCE FOR THE DAY OF JUDGMENT BECAUSE AS HE IS SO ALSO ARE WE IN THIS WORLD

THERE IS NO FEAR IN LOVE BUT PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR

FOR FEAR HAS TO DO WITH PUNISHMENT AND WHOEVER FEARS HAS NOT BEEN PERFECTED IN LOVE

WE LOVE BECAUSE HE FIRST LOVED US

IF ANYONE SAYS I LOVE GOD AND HATES HIS BROTHER HE IS A LIAR; FOR HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAS SEEN CANNOT LOVE GOD WHOM HE HAS NOT SEEN

AND THIS COMMANDMENT WE HAVE FROM HIM WHOEVER LOVES GOD MUST ALSO LOVE HIS BROTHER

EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST HAS BEEN BORN OF GOD AND EVERYONE WHO LOVES THE FATHER LOVES WHOEVER HAS BEEN BORN OF HIM

BY THIS WE KNOW THAT WE LOVE THE CHILDREN OF GOD WHEN WE LOVE GOD AND OBEY HIS COMMANDMENTS

FOR THIS IS THE LOVE OF GOD THAT WE KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS

AND HIS COMMANDMENTS ARE NOT BURDENSOME

FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN BORN OF GOD OVERCOMES THE WORLD

AND THIS IS THE VICTORY THAT HAS OVERCOME THE WORLDOUR FAITH

WHO IS IT THAT OVERCOMES THE WORLD EXCEPT THE ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD

THIS IS HE WHO CAME BY WATER AND BLOODJESUS CHRIST; NOT BY THE WATER ONLY BUT BY THE WATER AND THE BLOOD

AND THE SPIRIT IS THE ONE WHO TESTIFIES BECAUSE THE SPIRIT IS THE TRUTH

FOR THERE ARE THREE THAT TESTIFY THE SPIRIT AND THE WATER AND THE BLOOD; AND THESE THREE AGREE

IF WE RECEIVE THE TESTIMONY OF MEN THE TESTIMONY OF GOD IS GREATER FOR THIS IS THE TESTIMONY OF GOD THAT HE HAS BORNE CONCERNING HIS SON

WHOEVER BELIEVES IN THE SON OF GOD HAS THE TESTIMONY IN HIMSELF

WHOEVER DOES NOT BELIEVE GOD HAS MADE HIM A LIAR BECAUSE HE HAS NOT BELIEVED IN THE TESTIMONY THAT GOD HAS BORNE CONCERNING HIS SON

AND THIS IS THE TESTIMONY THAT GOD GAVE US ETERNAL LIFE AND THIS LIFE IS IN HIS SON

WHOEVER HAS THE SON HAS LIFE; WHOEVER DOES NOT HAVE THE SON OF GOD DOES NOT HAVE LIFE

I WRITE THESE THINGS TO YOU WHO BELIEVE IN THE NAME OF THE SON OF GOD THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE

AND THIS IS THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE TOWARD HIM THAT IF WE ASK ANYTHING ACCORDING TO HIS WILL HE HEARS US

AND IF WE KNOW THAT HE HEARS US IN WHATEVER WE ASK WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE REQUESTS THAT WE HAVE ASKED OF HIM

IF ANYONE SEES HIS BROTHER COMMITTING A SIN NOT LEADING TO DEATH HE SHALL ASK AND GOD WILL GIVE HIM LIFETO THOSE WHO COMMIT SINS THAT DO NOT LEAD TO DEATH

THERE IS SIN THAT LEADS TO DEATH; I DO NOT SAY THAT ONE SHOULD PRAY FOR THAT

ALL WRONGDOING IS SIN BUT THERE IS SIN THAT DOES NOT LEAD TO DEATH

WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN BORN OF GOD DOES NOT KEEP ON SINNING BUT HE WHO WAS BORN OF GOD PROTECTS HIM AND THE EVIL ONE DOES NOT TOUCH HIM

WE KNOW THAT WE ARE FROM GOD AND THE WHOLE WORLD LIES IN THE POWER OF THE EVIL ONE

AND WE KNOW THAT THE SON OF GOD HAS COME AND HAS GIVEN US UNDERSTANDING SO THAT WE MAY KNOW HIM WHO IS TRUE; AND WE ARE IN HIM WHO IS TRUE IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST

HE IS THE TRUE GOD AND ETERNAL LIFE

LITTLE CHILDREN KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS

LAMENTATIONSHOW LONELY SITS THE CITY THAT WAS FULL OF PEOPLE

HOW LIKE A WIDOW HAS SHE BECOME SHE WHO WAS GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS

SHE WHO WAS A PRINCESS AMONG THE PROVINCES HAS BECOME A SLAVE

SHE WEEPS BITTERLY IN THE NIGHT WITH TEARS ON HER CHEEKS; AMONG ALL HER LOVERS SHE HAS NONE TO COMFORT HER; ALL HER FRIENDS HAVE DEALT TREACHEROUSLY WITH HER; THEY HAVE BECOME HER ENEMIES

JUDAH HAS GONE INTO EXILE BECAUSE OF AFFLICTION AND HARD SERVITUDE; SHE DWELLS NOW AMONG THE NATIONS BUT FINDS NO RESTING PLACE; HER PURSUERS HAVE ALL OVERTAKEN HER IN THE MIDST OF HER DISTRESS

THE ROADS TO ZION MOURN FOR NONE COME TO THE FESTIVAL; ALL HER GATES ARE DESOLATE; HER PRIESTS GROAN; HER VIRGINS HAVE BEEN AFFLICTED AND SHE HERSELF SUFFERS BITTERLY

HER FOES HAVE BECOME THE HEAD; HER ENEMIES PROSPER BECAUSE THE LORD HAS AFFLICTED HER FOR THE MULTITUDE OF HER TRANSGRESSIONS; HER CHILDREN HAVE GONE AWAY CAPTIVES BEFORE THE FOE

FROM THE DAUGHTER OF ZION ALL HER MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED

HER PRINCES HAVE BECOME LIKE DEER THAT FIND NO PASTURE; THEY FLED WITHOUT STRENGTH BEFORE THE PURSUER

JERUSALEM REMEMBERS IN THE DAYS OF HER AFFLICTION AND WANDERING ALL THE PRECIOUS THINGS THAT WERE HERS FROM DAYS OF OLD

WHEN HER PEOPLE FELL INTO THE HAND OF THE FOE AND THERE WAS NONE TO HELP HER HER FOES GLOATED OVER HER; THEY MOCKED AT HER DOWNFALL

JERUSALEM SINNED GRIEVOUSLY; THEREFORE SHE BECAME FILTHY; ALL WHO HONORED HER DESPISE HER FOR THEY HAVE SEEN HER NAKEDNESS; SHE HERSELF GROANS AND TURNS HER FACE AWAY

HER UNCLEANNESS WAS IN HER SKIRTS; SHE TOOK NO THOUGHT OF HER FUTURE; THEREFORE HER FALL IS TERRIBLE; SHE HAS NO COMFORTER

O LORD BEHOLD MY AFFLICTION FOR THE ENEMY HAS TRIUMPHED

 THE ENEMY HAS STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS OVER ALL HER PRECIOUS THINGS; FOR SHE HAS SEEN THE NATIONS ENTER HER SANCTUARY THOSE WHOM YOU FORBADE TO ENTER YOUR CONGREGATION

ALL HER PEOPLE GROAN AS THEY SEARCH FOR BREAD; THEY TRADE THEIR TREASURES FOR FOOD TO REVIVE THEIR STRENGTH

LOOK O LORD AND SEE FOR I AM DESPISED

 IS IT NOTHING TO YOU ALL YOU WHO PASS BY

LOOK AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY SORROW LIKE MY SORROW WHICH WAS BROUGHT UPON ME WHICH THE LORD INFLICTED ON THE DAY OF HIS FIERCE ANGER

FROM ON HIGH HE SENT FIRE; INTO MY BONES HE MADE IT DESCEND; HE SPREAD A NET FOR MY FEET; HE TURNED ME BACK; HE HAS LEFT ME STUNNED FAINT ALL THE DAY LONG

MY TRANSGRESSIONS WERE BOUND INTO A YOKE; BY HIS HAND THEY WERE FASTENED TOGETHER; THEY WERE SET UPON MY NECK; HE CAUSED MY STRENGTH TO FAIL; THE LORD GAVE ME INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOM I CANNOT WITHSTAND

THE LORD REJECTED ALL MY MIGHTY MEN IN MY MIDST; HE SUMMONED AN ASSEMBLY AGAINST ME TO CRUSH MY YOUNG MEN; THE LORD HAS TRODDEN AS IN A WINEPRESS THE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF JUDAH

FOR THESE THINGS I WEEP; MY EYES FLOW WITH TEARS; FOR A COMFORTER IS FAR FROM ME ONE TO REVIVE MY SPIRIT; MY CHILDREN ARE DESOLATE FOR THE ENEMY HAS PREVAILED

 ZION STRETCHES OUT HER HANDS BUT THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT HER; THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AGAINST JACOB THAT HIS NEIGHBORS SHOULD BE HIS FOES; JERUSALEM HAS BECOME A FILTHY THING AMONG THEM

THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT FOR I HAVE REBELLED AGAINST HIS WORD; BUT HEAR ALL YOU PEOPLES AND SEE MY SUFFERING; MY YOUNG WOMEN AND MY YOUNG MEN HAVE GONE INTO CAPTIVITY

I CALLED TO MY LOVERS BUT THEY DECEIVED ME; MY PRIESTS AND ELDERS PERISHED IN THE CITY WHILE THEY SOUGHT FOOD TO REVIVE THEIR STRENGTH

LOOK O LORD FOR I AM IN DISTRESS; MY STOMACH CHURNS; MY HEART IS WRUNG WITHIN ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY REBELLIOUS

IN THE STREET THE SWORD BEREAVES; IN THE HOUSE IT IS LIKE DEATH

THEY HEARD MY GROANING YET THERE IS NO ONE TO COMFORT ME

ALL MY ENEMIES HAVE HEARD OF MY TROUBLE; THEY ARE GLAD THAT YOU HAVE DONE IT

YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE DAY YOU ANNOUNCED; NOW LET THEM BE AS I AM

LET ALL THEIR EVILDOING COME BEFORE YOU AND DEAL WITH THEM AS YOU HAVE DEALT WITH ME BECAUSE OF ALL MY TRANSGRESSIONS; FOR MY GROANS ARE MANY AND MY HEART IS FAINT

HOW THE LORD IN HIS ANGER HAS SET THE DAUGHTER OF ZION UNDER A CLOUD

HE HAS CAST DOWN FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH THE SPLENDOR OF ISRAEL; HE HAS NOT REMEMBERED HIS FOOTSTOOL IN THE DAY OF HIS ANGER

THE LORD HAS SWALLOWED UP WITHOUT MERCY ALL THE HABITATIONS OF JACOB; IN HIS WRATH HE HAS BROKEN DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS OF THE DAUGHTER OF JUDAH; HE HAS BROUGHT DOWN TO THE GROUND IN DISHONOR THE KINGDOM AND ITS RULERS

HE HAS CUT DOWN IN FIERCE ANGER ALL THE MIGHT OF ISRAEL; HE HAS WITHDRAWN FROM THEM HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY; HE HAS BURNED LIKE A FLAMING FIRE IN JACOB CONSUMING ALL AROUND

HE HAS BENT HIS BOW LIKE AN ENEMY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND SET LIKE A FOE; AND HE HAS KILLED ALL WHO WERE DELIGHTFUL IN OUR EYES IN THE TENT OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION; HE HAS POURED OUT HIS FURY LIKE FIRE

THE LORD HAS BECOME LIKE AN ENEMY; HE HAS SWALLOWED UP ISRAEL; HE HAS SWALLOWED UP ALL ITS PALACES; HE HAS LAID IN RUINS ITS STRONGHOLDS AND HE HAS MULTIPLIED IN THE DAUGHTER OF JUDAH MOURNING AND LAMENTATION

HE HAS LAID WASTE HIS BOOTH LIKE A GARDEN LAID IN RUINS HIS MEETING PLACE; THE LORD HAS MADE ZION FORGET FESTIVAL AND SABBATH AND IN HIS FIERCE INDIGNATION HAS SPURNED KING AND PRIEST

THE LORD HAS SCORNED HIS ALTAR DISOWNED HIS SANCTUARY; HE HAS DELIVERED INTO THE HAND OF THE ENEMY THE WALLS OF HER PALACES; THEY RAISED A CLAMOR IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AS ON THE DAY OF FESTIVAL

THE LORD DETERMINED TO LAY IN RUINS THE WALL OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION; HE STRETCHED OUT THE MEASURING LINE; HE DID NOT RESTRAIN HIS HAND FROM DESTROYING; HE CAUSED RAMPART AND WALL TO LAMENT; THEY LANGUISHED TOGETHER

HER GATES HAVE SUNK INTO THE GROUND; HE HAS RUINED AND BROKEN HER BARS; HER KING AND PRINCES ARE AMONG THE NATIONS; THE LAW IS NO MORE AND HER PROPHETS FIND NO VISION FROM THE LORD

THE ELDERS OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION SIT ON THE GROUND IN SILENCE; THEY HAVE THROWN DUST ON THEIR HEADS AND PUT ON SACKCLOTH; THE YOUNG WOMEN OF JERUSALEM HAVE BOWED THEIR HEADS TO THE GROUND

MY EYES ARE SPENT WITH WEEPING; MY STOMACH CHURNS; MY BILE IS POURED OUT TO THE GROUND BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE BECAUSE INFANTS AND BABIES FAINT IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY

THEY CRY TO THEIR MOTHERS WHERE IS BREAD AND WINE

 AS THEY FAINT LIKE A WOUNDED MAN IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY AS THEIR LIFE IS POURED OUT ON THEIR MOTHERS' BOSOM

WHAT CAN I SAY FOR YOU TO WHAT COMPARE YOU O DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

WHAT CAN I LIKEN TO YOU THAT I MAY COMFORT YOU O VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF ZION

FOR YOUR RUIN IS VAST AS THE SEA; WHO CAN HEAL YOU

YOUR PROPHETS HAVE SEEN FOR YOU FALSE AND DECEPTIVE VISIONS; THEY HAVE NOT EXPOSED YOUR INIQUITY TO RESTORE YOUR FORTUNES BUT HAVE SEEN FOR YOU ORACLES THAT ARE FALSE AND MISLEADING

ALL WHO PASS ALONG THE WAY CLAP THEIR HANDS AT YOU; THEY HISS AND WAG THEIR HEADS AT THE DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM; IS THIS THE CITY THAT WAS CALLED THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY THE JOY OF ALL THE EARTH

 ALL YOUR ENEMIES RAIL AGAINST YOU; THEY HISS THEY GNASH THEIR TEETH THEY CRY WE HAVE SWALLOWED HER

AH THIS IS THE DAY WE LONGED FOR; NOW WE HAVE IT; WE SEE IT

 THE LORD HAS DONE WHAT HE PURPOSED; HE HAS CARRIED OUT HIS WORD WHICH HE COMMANDED LONG AGO; HE HAS THROWN DOWN WITHOUT PITY; HE HAS MADE THE ENEMY REJOICE OVER YOU AND EXALTED THE MIGHT OF YOUR FOES

THEIR HEART CRIED TO THE LORD

O WALL OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION LET TEARS STREAM DOWN LIKE A TORRENT DAY AND NIGHT

GIVE YOURSELF NO REST YOUR EYES NO RESPITE

ARISE CRY OUT IN THE NIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT WATCHES

POUR OUT YOUR HEART LIKE WATER BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD

LIFT YOUR HANDS TO HIM FOR THE LIVES OF YOUR CHILDREN WHO FAINT FOR HUNGER AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET

 LOOK O LORD AND SEE

WITH WHOM HAVE YOU DEALT THUS

SHOULD WOMEN EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WOMB THE CHILDREN OF THEIR TENDER CARE

SHOULD PRIEST AND PROPHET BE KILLED IN THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD

IN THE DUST OF THE STREETS LIE THE YOUNG AND THE OLD; MY YOUNG WOMEN AND MY YOUNG MEN HAVE FALLEN BY THE SWORD; YOU HAVE KILLED THEM IN THE DAY OF YOUR ANGER SLAUGHTERING WITHOUT PITY

YOU SUMMONED AS IF TO A FESTIVAL DAY MY TERRORS ON EVERY SIDE AND ON THE DAY OF THE ANGER OF THE LORD NO ONE ESCAPED OR SURVIVED; THOSE WHOM I HELD AND RAISED MY ENEMY DESTROYED

I AM THE MAN WHO HAS SEEN AFFLICTION UNDER THE ROD OF HIS WRATH; HE HAS DRIVEN AND BROUGHT ME INTO DARKNESS WITHOUT ANY LIGHT; SURELY AGAINST ME HE TURNS HIS HAND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE WHOLE DAY LONG

HE HAS MADE MY FLESH AND MY SKIN WASTE AWAY; HE HAS BROKEN MY BONES; HE HAS BESIEGED AND ENVELOPED ME WITH BITTERNESS AND TRIBULATION; HE HAS MADE ME DWELL IN DARKNESS LIKE THE DEAD OF LONG AGO

HE HAS WALLED ME ABOUT SO THAT I CANNOT ESCAPE; HE HAS MADE MY CHAINS HEAVY; THOUGH I CALL AND CRY FOR HELP HE SHUTS OUT MY PRAYER; HE HAS BLOCKED MY WAYS WITH BLOCKS OF STONES; HE HAS MADE MY PATHS CROOKED

HE IS A BEAR LYING IN WAIT FOR ME A LION IN HIDING; HE TURNED ASIDE MY STEPS AND TORE ME TO PIECES; HE HAS MADE ME DESOLATE; HE BENT HIS BOW AND SET ME AS A TARGET FOR HIS ARROW

HE DROVE INTO MY KIDNEYS THE ARROWS OF HIS QUIVER; I HAVE BECOME THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF ALL PEOPLES THE OBJECT OF THEIR TAUNTS ALL DAY LONG

HE HAS FILLED ME WITH BITTERNESS; HE HAS SATED ME WITH WORMWOOD

HE HAS MADE MY TEETH GRIND ON GRAVEL AND MADE ME COWER IN ASHES; MY SOUL IS BEREFT OF PEACE; I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT HAPPINESS IS; SO I SAY MY ENDURANCE HAS PERISHED; SO HAS MY HOPE FROM THE LORD

 REMEMBER MY AFFLICTION AND MY WANDERINGS THE WORMWOOD AND THE GALL

MY SOUL CONTINUALLY REMEMBERS IT AND IS BOWED DOWN WITHIN ME

BUT THIS I CALL TO MIND AND THEREFORE I HAVE HOPE THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD NEVER CEASES; HIS MERCIES NEVER COME TO AN END; THEY ARE NEW EVERY MORNING; GREAT IS YOUR FAITHFULNESS

THE LORD IS MY PORTION SAYS MY SOUL THEREFORE I WILL HOPE IN HIM

 THE LORD IS GOOD TO THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIM TO THE SOUL WHO SEEKS HIM

IT IS GOOD THAT ONE SHOULD WAIT QUIETLY FOR THE SALVATION OF THE LORD

IT IS GOOD FOR A MAN THAT HE BEAR THE YOKE IN HIS YOUTH

LET HIM SIT ALONE IN SILENCE WHEN IT IS LAID ON HIM; LET HIM PUT HIS MOUTH IN THE DUSTTHERE MAY YET BE HOPE; LET HIM GIVE HIS CHEEK TO THE ONE WHO STRIKES AND LET HIM BE FILLED WITH INSULTS

FOR THE LORD WILL NOT CAST OFF FOREVER BUT THOUGH HE CAUSE GRIEF HE WILL HAVE COMPASSION ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS STEADFAST LOVE; FOR HE DOES NOT WILLINGLY AFFLICT OR GRIEVE THE CHILDREN OF MEN

TO CRUSH UNDERFOOT ALL THE PRISONERS OF THE EARTH TO DENY A MAN JUSTICE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST HIGH TO SUBVERT A MAN IN HIS LAWSUIT THE LORD DOES NOT APPROVE

WHO HAS SPOKEN AND IT CAME TO PASS UNLESS THE LORD HAS COMMANDED IT

IS IT NOT FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH THAT GOOD AND BAD COME

WHY SHOULD A LIVING MAN COMPLAIN A MAN ABOUT THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS SINS

LET US TEST AND EXAMINE OUR WAYS AND RETURN TO THE LORD

LET US LIFT UP OUR HEARTS AND HANDS TO GOD IN HEAVEN WE HAVE TRANSGRESSED AND REBELLED AND YOU HAVE NOT FORGIVEN

YOU HAVE WRAPPED YOURSELF WITH ANGER AND PURSUED US KILLING WITHOUT PITY; YOU HAVE WRAPPED YOURSELF WITH A CLOUD SO THAT NO PRAYER CAN PASS THROUGH

YOU HAVE MADE US SCUM AND GARBAGE AMONG THE PEOPLES

ALL OUR ENEMIES OPEN THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST US; PANIC AND PITFALL HAVE COME UPON US DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION; MY EYES FLOW WITH RIVERS OF TEARS BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE

MY EYES WILL FLOW WITHOUT CEASING WITHOUT RESPITE UNTIL THE LORD FROM HEAVEN LOOKS DOWN AND SEES; MY EYES CAUSE ME GRIEF AT THE FATE OF ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF MY CITY

I HAVE BEEN HUNTED LIKE A BIRD BY THOSE WHO WERE MY ENEMIES WITHOUT CAUSE; THEY FLUNG ME ALIVE INTO THE PIT AND CAST STONES ON ME; WATER CLOSED OVER MY HEAD; I SAID 'I AM LOST

' I CALLED ON YOUR NAME O LORD FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE PIT; YOU HEARD MY PLEA 'DO NOT CLOSE YOUR EAR TO MY CRY FOR HELP

' YOU CAME NEAR WHEN I CALLED ON YOU; YOU SAID 'DO NOT FEAR

' YOU HAVE TAKEN UP MY CAUSE O LORD; YOU HAVE REDEEMED MY LIFE

YOU HAVE SEEN THE WRONG DONE TO ME O LORD; JUDGE MY CAUSE

YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THEIR VENGEANCE ALL THEIR PLOTS AGAINST ME

YOU HAVE HEARD THEIR TAUNTS O LORD ALL THEIR PLOTS AGAINST ME

THE LIPS AND THOUGHTS OF MY ASSAILANTS ARE AGAINST ME ALL THE DAY LONG

BEHOLD THEIR SITTING AND THEIR RISING; I AM THE OBJECT OF THEIR TAUNTS

YOU WILL REPAY THEM O LORD ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS

YOU WILL GIVE THEM DULLNESS OF HEART; YOUR CURSE WILL BE ON THEM

YOU WILL PURSUE THEM IN ANGER AND DESTROY THEM FROM UNDER YOUR HEAVENS O LORD

HOW THE GOLD HAS GROWN DIM HOW THE PURE GOLD IS CHANGED

THE HOLY STONES LIE SCATTERED AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET

THE PRECIOUS SONS OF ZION WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN FINE GOLD HOW THEY ARE REGARDED AS EARTHEN POTS THE WORK OF A POTTER'S HANDS

EVEN JACKALS OFFER THE BREAST; THEY NURSE THEIR YOUNG BUT THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE HAS BECOME CRUEL LIKE THE OSTRICHES IN THE WILDERNESS

THE TONGUE OF THE NURSING INFANT STICKS TO THE ROOF OF ITS MOUTH FOR THIRST; THE CHILDREN BEG FOR FOOD BUT NO ONE GIVES TO THEM

THOSE WHO ONCE FEASTED ON DELICACIES PERISH IN THE STREETS; THOSE WHO WERE BROUGHT UP IN PURPLE EMBRACE ASH HEAPS

FOR THE CHASTISEMENT OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE HAS BEEN GREATER THAN THE PUNISHMENT OF SODOM WHICH WAS OVERTHROWN IN A MOMENT AND NO HANDS WERE WRUNG FOR HER

HER PRINCES WERE PURER THAN SNOW WHITER THAN MILK; THEIR BODIES WERE MORE RUDDY THAN CORAL THE BEAUTY OF THEIR FORM WAS LIKE SAPPHIRE

NOW THEIR FACE IS BLACKER THAN SOOT; THEY ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE STREETS; THEIR SKIN HAS SHRIVELED ON THEIR BONES; IT HAS BECOME AS DRY AS WOOD

HAPPIER WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE SWORD THAN THE VICTIMS OF HUNGER WHO WASTED AWAY PIERCED BY LACK OF THE FRUITS OF THE FIELD

THE HANDS OF COMPASSIONATE WOMEN HAVE BOILED THEIR OWN CHILDREN; THEY BECAME THEIR FOOD DURING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE

THE LORD GAVE FULL VENT TO HIS WRATH; HE POURED OUT HIS HOT ANGER AND HE KINDLED A FIRE IN ZION THAT CONSUMED ITS FOUNDATIONS

THE KINGS OF THE EARTH DID NOT BELIEVE NOR ANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD THAT FOE OR ENEMY COULD ENTER THE GATES OF JERUSALEM

THIS WAS FOR THE SINS OF HER PROPHETS AND THE INIQUITIES OF HER PRIESTS WHO SHED IN THE MIDST OF HER THE BLOOD OF THE RIGHTEOUS

THEY WANDERED BLIND THROUGH THE STREETS; THEY WERE SO DEFILED WITH BLOOD THAT NO ONE WAS ABLE TO TOUCH THEIR GARMENTS

AWAY

UNCLEAN

 PEOPLE CRIED AT THEM

AWAY

AWAY

DO NOT TOUCH

 SO THEY BECAME FUGITIVES AND WANDERERS; PEOPLE SAID AMONG THE NATIONS THEY SHALL STAY WITH US NO LONGER

 THE LORD HIMSELF HAS SCATTERED THEM; HE WILL REGARD THEM NO MORE; NO HONOR WAS SHOWN TO THE PRIESTS NO FAVOR TO THE ELDERS

OUR EYES FAILED EVER WATCHING VAINLY FOR HELP; IN OUR WATCHING WE WATCHED FOR A NATION WHICH COULD NOT SAVE

THEY DOGGED OUR STEPS SO THAT WE COULD NOT WALK IN OUR STREETS; OUR END DREW NEAR; OUR DAYS WERE NUMBERED FOR OUR END HAD COME

OUR PURSUERS WERE SWIFTER THAN THE EAGLES IN THE HEAVENS; THEY CHASED US ON THE MOUNTAINS; THEY LAY IN WAIT FOR US IN THE WILDERNESS

THE BREATH OF OUR NOSTRILS THE LORD'S ANOINTED WAS CAPTURED IN THEIR PITS OF WHOM WE SAID UNDER HIS SHADOW WE SHALL LIVE AMONG THE NATIONS

 REJOICE AND BE GLAD O DAUGHTER OF EDOM YOU WHO DWELL IN THE LAND OF UZ; BUT TO YOU ALSO THE CUP SHALL PASS; YOU SHALL BECOME DRUNK AND STRIP YOURSELF BARE

THE PUNISHMENT OF YOUR INIQUITY O DAUGHTER OF ZION IS ACCOMPLISHED; HE WILL KEEP YOU IN EXILE NO LONGER; BUT YOUR INIQUITY O DAUGHTER OF EDOM HE WILL PUNISH; HE WILL UNCOVER YOUR SINS

REMEMBER O LORD WHAT HAS BEFALLEN US; LOOK AND SEE OUR DISGRACE

OUR INHERITANCE HAS BEEN TURNED OVER TO STRANGERS OUR HOMES TO FOREIGNERS

WE HAVE BECOME ORPHANS FATHERLESS; OUR MOTHERS ARE LIKE WIDOWS

WE MUST PAY FOR THE WATER WE DRINK; THE WOOD WE GET MUST BE BOUGHT

OUR PURSUERS ARE AT OUR NECKS; WE ARE WEARY; WE ARE GIVEN NO REST

WE HAVE GIVEN THE HAND TO EGYPT AND TO ASSYRIA TO GET BREAD ENOUGH

OUR FATHERS SINNED AND ARE NO MORE; AND WE BEAR THEIR INIQUITIES

SLAVES RULE OVER US; THERE IS NONE TO DELIVER US FROM THEIR HAND

WE GET OUR BREAD AT THE PERIL OF OUR LIVES BECAUSE OF THE SWORD IN THE WILDERNESS

OUR SKIN IS HOT AS AN OVEN WITH THE BURNING HEAT OF FAMINE

WOMEN ARE RAPED IN ZION YOUNG WOMEN IN THE TOWNS OF JUDAH

PRINCES ARE HUNG UP BY THEIR HANDS; NO RESPECT IS SHOWN TO THE ELDERS

YOUNG MEN ARE COMPELLED TO GRIND AT THE MILL AND BOYS STAGGER UNDER LOADS OF WOOD

THE OLD MEN HAVE LEFT THE CITY GATE THE YOUNG MEN THEIR MUSIC

THE JOY OF OUR HEARTS HAS CEASED; OUR DANCING HAS BEEN TURNED TO MOURNING

THE CROWN HAS FALLEN FROM OUR HEAD; WOE TO US FOR WE HAVE SINNED

FOR THIS OUR HEART HAS BECOME SICK FOR THESE THINGS OUR EYES HAVE GROWN DIM FOR MOUNT ZION WHICH LIES DESOLATE; JACKALS PROWL OVER IT

BUT YOU O LORD REIGN FOREVER; YOUR THRONE ENDURES TO ALL GENERATIONS

WHY DO YOU FORGET US FOREVER WHY DO YOU FORSAKE US FOR SO MANY DAYS

RESTORE US TO YOURSELF O LORD THAT WE MAY BE RESTORED

RENEW OUR DAYS AS OF OLD UNLESS YOU HAVE UTTERLY REJECTED US AND YOU REMAIN EXCEEDINGLY ANGRY WITH US

AMOSTHE WORDS OF AMOS WHO WAS AMONG THE SHEPHERDS OF TEKOA WHICH HE SAW CONCERNING ISRAEL IN THE DAYS OF UZZIAH KING OF JUDAH AND IN THE DAYS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF JOASH KING OF ISRAEL TWO YEARS BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE

AND HE SAID THE LORD ROARS FROM ZION AND UTTERS HIS VOICE FROM JERUSALEM; THE PASTURES OF THE SHEPHERDS MOURN AND THE TOP OF CARMEL WITHERS

 THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF DAMASCUS AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THRESHED GILEAD WITH THRESHING SLEDGES OF IRON

SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON THE HOUSE OF HAZAEL AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE STRONGHOLDS OF BENHADAD

SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON THE WALL OF TYRE AND IT SHALL DEVOUR HER STRONGHOLDS

 THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD AND CAST OFF ALL PITY AND HIS ANGER TORE PERPETUALLY AND HE KEPT HIS WRATH FOREVER

SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON TEMAN AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE STRONGHOLDS OF BOZRAH

 THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE AMMONITES AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE RIPPED OPEN PREGNANT WOMEN IN GILEAD THAT THEY MIGHT ENLARGE THEIR BORDER

SO I WILL KINDLE A FIRE IN THE WALL OF RABBAH AND IT SHALL DEVOUR HER STRONGHOLDS WITH SHOUTING ON THE DAY OF BATTLE WITH A TEMPEST IN THE DAY OF THE WHIRLWIND; AND THEIR KING SHALL GO INTO EXILE HE AND HIS PRINCES TOGETHER SAYS THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF MOAB AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE BURNED TO LIME THE BONES OF THE KING OF EDOM

SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON MOAB AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE STRONGHOLDS OF KERIOTH AND MOAB SHALL DIE AMID UPROAR AMID SHOUTING AND THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET; I WILL CUT OFF THE RULER FROM ITS MIDST AND WILL KILL ALL ITS PRINCES WITH HIM SAYS THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF JUDAH AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE REJECTED THE LAW OF THE LORD AND HAVE NOT KEPT HIS STATUTES BUT THEIR LIES HAVE LED THEM ASTRAY THOSE AFTER WHICH THEIR FATHERS WALKED

SO I WILL SEND A FIRE UPON JUDAH AND IT SHALL DEVOUR THE STRONGHOLDS OF JERUSALEM

 THUS SAYS THE LORD FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF ISRAEL AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT REVOKE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY SELL THE RIGHTEOUS FOR SILVER AND THE NEEDY FOR A PAIR OF SANDALS THOSE WHO TRAMPLE THE HEAD OF THE POOR INTO THE DUST OF THE EARTH AND TURN ASIDE THE WAY OF THE AFFLICTED; A MAN AND HIS FATHER GO IN TO THE SAME GIRL SO THAT MY HOLY NAME IS PROFANED; THEY LAY THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE EVERY ALTAR ON GARMENTS TAKEN IN PLEDGE AND IN THE HOUSE OF THEIR GOD THEY DRINK THE WINE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FINED

YET IT WAS I WHO DESTROYED THE AMORITE BEFORE THEM WHOSE HEIGHT WAS LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE CEDARS AND WHO WAS AS STRONG AS THE OAKS; I DESTROYED HIS FRUIT ABOVE AND HIS ROOTS BENEATH

ALSO IT WAS I WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND LED YOU FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS TO POSSESS THE LAND OF THE AMORITE

AND I RAISED UP SOME OF YOUR SONS FOR PROPHETS AND SOME OF YOUR YOUNG MEN FOR NAZIRITES

IS IT NOT INDEED SO O PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 DECLARES THE LORD

BUT YOU MADE THE NAZIRITES DRINK WINE AND COMMANDED THE PROPHETS SAYING 'YOU SHALL NOT PROPHESY

' BEHOLD I WILL PRESS YOU DOWN IN YOUR PLACE AS A CART FULL OF SHEAVES PRESSES DOWN

FLIGHT SHALL PERISH FROM THE SWIFT AND THE STRONG SHALL NOT RETAIN HIS STRENGTH NOR SHALL THE MIGHTY SAVE HIS LIFE; HE WHO HANDLES THE BOW SHALL NOT STAND AND HE WHO IS SWIFT OF FOOT SHALL NOT SAVE HIMSELF NOR SHALL HE WHO RIDES THE HORSE SAVE HIS LIFE; AND HE WHO IS STOUT OF HEART AMONG THE MIGHTY SHALL FLEE AWAY NAKED IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD

HEAR THIS WORD THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN AGAINST YOU O PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AGAINST THE WHOLE FAMILY THAT I BROUGHT UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT YOU ONLY HAVE I KNOWN OF ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH; THEREFORE I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR ALL YOUR INIQUITIES

DO TWO WALK TOGETHER UNLESS THEY HAVE AGREED TO MEET

DOES A LION ROAR IN THE FOREST WHEN HE HAS NO PREY

DOES A YOUNG LION CRY OUT FROM HIS DEN IF HE HAS TAKEN NOTHING

DOES A BIRD FALL IN A SNARE ON THE EARTH WHEN THERE IS NO TRAP FOR IT

DOES A SNARE SPRING UP FROM THE GROUND WHEN IT HAS TAKEN NOTHING

IS A TRUMPET BLOWN IN A CITY AND THE PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRAID

DOES DISASTER COME TO A CITY UNLESS THE LORD HAS DONE IT

FOR THE LORD GOD DOES NOTHING WITHOUT REVEALING HIS SECRET TO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

THE LION HAS ROARED; WHO WILL NOT FEAR

THE LORD GOD HAS SPOKEN; WHO CAN BUT PROPHESY

 PROCLAIM TO THE STRONGHOLDS IN ASHDOD AND TO THE STRONGHOLDS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND SAY ASSEMBLE YOURSELVES ON THE MOUNTAINS OF SAMARIA AND SEE THE GREAT TUMULTS WITHIN HER AND THE OPPRESSED IN HER MIDST

 THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO RIGHT DECLARES THE LORD THOSE WHO STORE UP VIOLENCE AND ROBBERY IN THEIR STRONGHOLDS

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD AN ADVERSARY SHALL SURROUND THE LAND AND BRING DOWN YOUR DEFENSES FROM YOU AND YOUR STRONGHOLDS SHALL BE PLUNDERED

 THUS SAYS THE LORD AS THE SHEPHERD RESCUES FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LION TWO LEGS OR A PIECE OF AN EAR SO SHALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO DWELL IN SAMARIA BE RESCUED WITH THE CORNER OF A COUCH AND PART OF A BED

HEAR AND TESTIFY AGAINST THE HOUSE OF JACOB DECLARES THE LORD GOD THE GOD OF HOSTS THAT ON THE DAY I PUNISH ISRAEL FOR HIS TRANSGRESSIONS I WILL PUNISH THE ALTARS OF BETHEL AND THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR SHALL BE CUT OFF AND FALL TO THE GROUND

 SEEK THE LORD AND LIVE LEST HE BREAK OUT LIKE FIRE IN THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH AND IT DEVOUR WITH NONE TO QUENCH IT FOR BETHEL O YOU WHO TURN JUSTICE TO WORMWOOD AND CAST DOWN RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE EARTH

HE WHO MADE THE PLEIADES AND ORION AND TURNS DEEP DARKNESS INTO THE MORNING AND DARKENS THE DAY INTO NIGHT WHO CALLS FOR THE WATERS OF THE SEA AND POURS THEM OUT ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE LORD IS HIS NAME; WHO MAKES DESTRUCTION FLASH FORTH AGAINST THE STRONG SO THAT DESTRUCTION COMES UPON THE FORTRESS

THEY HATE HIM WHO REPROVES IN THE GATE AND THEY ABHOR HIM WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH

THEREFORE BECAUSE YOU TRAMPLE ON THE POOR AND YOU EXACT TAXES OF GRAIN FROM HIM YOU HAVE BUILT HOUSES OF HEWN STONE BUT YOU SHALL NOT DWELL IN THEM; YOU HAVE PLANTED PLEASANT VINEYARDS BUT YOU SHALL NOT DRINK THEIR WINE

FOR I KNOW HOW MANY ARE YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND HOW GREAT ARE YOUR SINSYOU WHO AFFLICT THE RIGHTEOUS WHO TAKE A BRIBE AND TURN ASIDE THE NEEDY IN THE GATE

THEREFORE HE WHO IS PRUDENT WILL KEEP SILENT IN SUCH A TIME FOR IT IS AN EVIL TIME

HATE EVIL AND LOVE GOOD AND ESTABLISH JUSTICE IN THE GATE; IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS WILL BE GRACIOUS TO THE REMNANT OF JOSEPH

WOE TO YOU WHO DESIRE THE DAY OF THE LORD

WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THE DAY OF THE LORD

IT IS DARKNESS AND NOT LIGHT AS IF A MAN FLED FROM A LION AND A BEAR MET HIM OR WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND LEANED HIS HAND AGAINST THE WALL AND A SERPENT BIT HIM

IS NOT THE DAY OF THE LORD DARKNESS AND NOT LIGHT AND GLOOM WITH NO BRIGHTNESS IN IT

I HATE I DESPISE YOUR FEASTS AND I TAKE NO DELIGHT IN YOUR SOLEMN ASSEMBLIES

EVEN THOUGH YOU OFFER ME YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND GRAIN OFFERINGS I WILL NOT ACCEPT THEM; AND THE PEACE OFFERINGS OF YOUR FATTENED ANIMALS I WILL NOT LOOK UPON THEM

TAKE AWAY FROM ME THE NOISE OF YOUR SONGS; TO THE MELODY OF YOUR HARPS I WILL NOT LISTEN

BUT LET JUSTICE ROLL DOWN LIKE WATERS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE AN EVERFLOWING STREAM

DID YOU BRING TO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS DURING THE FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

YOU SHALL TAKE UP SIKKUTH YOUR KING AND KIYYUN YOUR STARGODYOUR IMAGES THAT YOU MADE FOR YOURSELVES AND I WILL SEND YOU INTO EXILE BEYOND DAMASCUS SAYS THE LORD WHOSE NAME IS THE GOD OF HOSTS

WOE TO THOSE WHO ARE AT EASE IN ZION AND TO THOSE WHO FEEL SECURE ON THE MOUNTAIN OF SAMARIA THE NOTABLE MEN OF THE FIRST OF THE NATIONS TO WHOM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL COMES

PASS OVER TO CALNEH AND SEE AND FROM THERE GO TO HAMATH THE GREAT; THEN GO DOWN TO GATH OF THE PHILISTINES

ARE YOU BETTER THAN THESE KINGDOMS

OR IS THEIR TERRITORY GREATER THAN YOUR TERRITORY O YOU WHO PUT FAR AWAY THE DAY OF DISASTER AND BRING NEAR THE SEAT OF VIOLENCE

WOE TO THOSE WHO LIE ON BEDS OF IVORY AND STRETCH THEMSELVES OUT ON THEIR COUCHES AND EAT LAMBS FROM THE FLOCK AND CALVES FROM THE MIDST OF THE STALL WHO SING IDLE SONGS TO THE SOUND OF THE HARP AND LIKE DAVID INVENT FOR THEMSELVES INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC WHO DRINK WINE IN BOWLS AND ANOINT THEMSELVES WITH THE FINEST OILS BUT ARE NOT GRIEVED OVER THE RUIN OF JOSEPH

THEREFORE THEY SHALL NOW BE THE FIRST OF THOSE WHO GO INTO EXILE AND THE REVELRY OF THOSE WHO STRETCH THEMSELVES OUT SHALL PASS AWAY

 THE LORD GOD HAS SWORN BY HIMSELF DECLARES THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS I ABHOR THE PRIDE OF JACOB AND HATE HIS STRONGHOLDS AND I WILL DELIVER UP THE CITY AND ALL THAT IS IN IT

 AND IF TEN MEN REMAIN IN ONE HOUSE THEY SHALL DIE

AND WHEN ONE'S RELATIVE THE ONE WHO ANOINTS HIM FOR BURIAL SHALL TAKE HIM UP TO BRING THE BONES OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHALL SAY TO HIM WHO IS IN THE INNERMOST PARTS OF THE HOUSE IS THERE STILL ANYONE WITH YOU

 HE SHALL SAY NO; AND HE SHALL SAY SILENCE

WE MUST NOT MENTION THE NAME OF THE LORD

 FOR BEHOLD THE LORD COMMANDS AND THE GREAT HOUSE SHALL BE STRUCK DOWN INTO FRAGMENTS AND THE LITTLE HOUSE INTO BITS

DO HORSES RUN ON ROCKS

DOES ONE PLOW THERE WITH OXEN

BUT YOU HAVE TURNED JUSTICE INTO POISON AND THE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS INTO WORMWOOD YOU WHO REJOICE IN LODEBAR WHO SAY HAVE WE NOT BY OUR OWN STRENGTH CAPTURED KARNAIM FOR OURSELVES

 FOR BEHOLD I WILL RAISE UP AGAINST YOU A NATION O HOUSE OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD THE GOD OF HOSTS; AND THEY SHALL OPPRESS YOU FROM LEBOHAMATH TO THE BROOK OF THE ARABAH

THIS IS WHAT THE LORD GOD SHOWED ME BEHOLD HE WAS FORMING LOCUSTS WHEN THE LATTER GROWTH WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SPROUT AND BEHOLD IT WAS THE LATTER GROWTH AFTER THE KING'S MOWINGS

WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING THE GRASS OF THE LAND I SAID O LORD GOD PLEASE FORGIVE

HOW CAN JACOB STAND

HE IS SO SMALL

 THE LORD RELENTED CONCERNING THIS; IT SHALL NOT BE SAID THE LORD

THIS IS WHAT THE LORD GOD SHOWED ME BEHOLD THE LORD GOD WAS CALLING FOR A JUDGMENT BY FIRE AND IT DEVOURED THE GREAT DEEP AND WAS EATING UP THE LAND

THEN I SAID O LORD GOD PLEASE CEASE

HOW CAN JACOB STAND

HE IS SO SMALL

 THE LORD RELENTED CONCERNING THIS; THIS ALSO SHALL NOT BE SAID THE LORD GOD

THIS IS WHAT HE SHOWED ME BEHOLD THE LORD WAS STANDING BESIDE A WALL BUILT WITH A PLUMB LINE WITH A PLUMB LINE IN HIS HAND

AND THE LORD SAID TO ME AMOS WHAT DO YOU SEE

 AND I SAID A PLUMB LINE

 THEN THE LORD SAID BEHOLD I AM SETTING A PLUMB LINE IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL; I WILL NEVER AGAIN PASS BY THEM; THE HIGH PLACES OF ISAAC SHALL BE MADE DESOLATE AND THE SANCTUARIES OF ISRAEL SHALL BE LAID WASTE AND I WILL RISE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM WITH THE SWORD

 THEN AMAZIAH THE PRIEST OF BETHEL SENT TO JEROBOAM KING OF ISRAEL SAYING AMOS HAS CONSPIRED AGAINST YOU IN THE MIDST OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THE LAND IS NOT ABLE TO BEAR ALL HIS WORDS

FOR THUS AMOS HAS SAID 'JEROBOAM SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD AND ISRAEL MUST GO INTO EXILE AWAY FROM HIS LAND

' AND AMAZIAH SAID TO AMOS O SEER GO FLEE AWAY TO THE LAND OF JUDAH AND EAT BREAD THERE AND PROPHESY THERE BUT NEVER AGAIN PROPHESY AT BETHEL FOR IT IS THE KING'S SANCTUARY AND IT IS A TEMPLE OF THE KINGDOM

 THEN AMOS ANSWERED AND SAID TO AMAZIAH I WAS NO PROPHET NOR A PROPHET'S SON BUT I WAS A HERDSMAN AND A DRESSER OF SYCAMORE FIGS

BUT THE LORD TOOK ME FROM FOLLOWING THE FLOCK AND THE LORD SAID TO ME 'GO PROPHESY TO MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' NOW THEREFORE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

YOU SAY 'DO NOT PROPHESY AGAINST ISRAEL AND DO NOT PREACH AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISAAC

' THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD 'YOUR WIFE SHALL BE A PROSTITUTE IN THE CITY AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD AND YOUR LAND SHALL BE DIVIDED UP WITH A MEASURING LINE; YOU YOURSELF SHALL DIE IN AN UNCLEAN LAND AND ISRAEL SHALL SURELY GO INTO EXILE AWAY FROM ITS LAND

'THIS IS WHAT THE LORD GOD SHOWED ME BEHOLD A BASKET OF SUMMER FRUIT

AND HE SAID AMOS WHAT DO YOU SEE

 AND I SAID A BASKET OF SUMMER FRUIT

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO ME THE END HAS COME UPON MY PEOPLE ISRAEL; I WILL NEVER AGAIN PASS BY THEM

THE SONGS OF THE TEMPLE SHALL BECOME WAILINGS IN THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD GOD

SO MANY DEAD BODIES

THEY ARE THROWN EVERYWHERE

SILENCE

 HEAR THIS YOU WHO TRAMPLE ON THE NEEDY AND BRING THE POOR OF THE LAND TO AN END SAYING WHEN WILL THE NEW MOON BE OVER THAT WE MAY SELL GRAIN

AND THE SABBATH THAT WE MAY OFFER WHEAT FOR SALE THAT WE MAY MAKE THE EPHAH SMALL AND THE SHEKEL GREAT AND DEAL DECEITFULLY WITH FALSE BALANCES THAT WE MAY BUY THE POOR FOR SILVER AND THE NEEDY FOR A PAIR OF SANDALS AND SELL THE CHAFF OF THE WHEAT

 THE LORD HAS SWORN BY THE PRIDE OF JACOB SURELY I WILL NEVER FORGET ANY OF THEIR DEEDS

SHALL NOT THE LAND TREMBLE ON THIS ACCOUNT AND EVERYONE MOURN WHO DWELLS IN IT AND ALL OF IT RISE LIKE THE NILE AND BE TOSSED ABOUT AND SINK AGAIN LIKE THE NILE OF EGYPT

 AND ON THAT DAY DECLARES THE LORD GOD I WILL MAKE THE SUN GO DOWN AT NOON AND DARKEN THE EARTH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

I WILL TURN YOUR FEASTS INTO MOURNING AND ALL YOUR SONGS INTO LAMENTATION; I WILL BRING SACKCLOTH ON EVERY WAIST AND BALDNESS ON EVERY HEAD; I WILL MAKE IT LIKE THE MOURNING FOR AN ONLY SON AND THE END OF IT LIKE A BITTER DAY

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD GOD WHEN I WILL SEND A FAMINE ON THE LANDNOT A FAMINE OF BREAD NOR A THIRST FOR WATER BUT OF HEARING THE WORDS OF THE LORD

THEY SHALL WANDER FROM SEA TO SEA AND FROM NORTH TO EAST; THEY SHALL RUN TO AND FRO TO SEEK THE WORD OF THE LORD BUT THEY SHALL NOT FIND IT

IN THAT DAY THE LOVELY VIRGINS AND THE YOUNG MEN SHALL FAINT FOR THIRST

THOSE WHO SWEAR BY THE GUILT OF SAMARIA AND SAY 'AS YOUR GOD LIVES O DAN' AND 'AS THE WAY OF BEERSHEBA LIVES' THEY SHALL FALL AND NEVER RISE AGAIN

I SAW THE LORD STANDING BESIDE THE ALTAR AND HE SAID STRIKE THE CAPITALS UNTIL THE THRESHOLDS SHAKE AND SHATTER THEM ON THE HEADS OF ALL THE PEOPLE; AND THOSE WHO ARE LEFT OF THEM I WILL KILL WITH THE SWORD; NOT ONE OF THEM SHALL FLEE AWAY; NOT ONE OF THEM SHALL ESCAPE

IF THEY DIG INTO SHEOL FROM THERE SHALL MY HAND TAKE THEM; IF THEY CLIMB UP TO HEAVEN FROM THERE I WILL BRING THEM DOWN

IF THEY HIDE THEMSELVES ON THE TOP OF CARMEL FROM THERE I WILL SEARCH THEM OUT AND TAKE THEM; AND IF THEY HIDE FROM MY SIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THERE I WILL COMMAND THE SERPENT AND IT SHALL BITE THEM

AND IF THEY GO INTO CAPTIVITY BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES THERE I WILL COMMAND THE SWORD AND IT SHALL KILL THEM; AND I WILL FIX MY EYES UPON THEM FOR EVIL AND NOT FOR GOOD

 THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS HE WHO TOUCHES THE EARTH AND IT MELTS AND ALL WHO DWELL IN IT MOURN AND ALL OF IT RISES LIKE THE NILE AND SINKS AGAIN LIKE THE NILE OF EGYPT; WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS AND FOUNDS HIS VAULT UPON THE EARTH; WHO CALLS FOR THE WATERS OF THE SEA AND POURS THEM OUT UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTHTHE LORD IS HIS NAME

ARE YOU NOT LIKE THE CUSHITES TO ME O PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 DECLARES THE LORD

DID I NOT BRING UP ISRAEL FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE PHILISTINES FROM CAPHTOR AND THE SYRIANS FROM KIR

BEHOLD THE EYES OF THE LORD GOD ARE UPON THE SINFUL KINGDOM AND I WILL DESTROY IT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND EXCEPT THAT I WILL NOT UTTERLY DESTROY THE HOUSE OF JACOB DECLARES THE LORD

FOR BEHOLD I WILL COMMAND AND SHAKE THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AMONG ALL THE NATIONS AS ONE SHAKES WITH A SIEVE BUT NO PEBBLE SHALL FALL TO THE EARTH

ALL THE SINNERS OF MY PEOPLE SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD WHO SAY 'DISASTER SHALL NOT OVERTAKE OR MEET US

' IN THAT DAY I WILL RAISE UP THE BOOTH OF DAVID THAT IS FALLEN AND REPAIR ITS BREACHES AND RAISE UP ITS RUINS AND REBUILD IT AS IN THE DAYS OF OLD THAT THEY MAY POSSESS THE REMNANT OF EDOM AND ALL THE NATIONS WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME DECLARES THE LORD WHO DOES THIS

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN THE PLOWMAN SHALL OVERTAKE THE REAPER AND THE TREADER OF GRAPES HIM WHO SOWS THE SEED; THE MOUNTAINS SHALL DRIP SWEET WINE AND ALL THE HILLS SHALL FLOW WITH IT

I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND THEY SHALL REBUILD THE RUINED CITIES AND INHABIT THEM; THEY SHALL PLANT VINEYARDS AND DRINK THEIR WINE AND THEY SHALL MAKE GARDENS AND EAT THEIR FRUIT

I WILL PLANT THEM ON THEIR LAND AND THEY SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE UPROOTED OUT OF THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM SAYS THE LORD YOUR GOD

 SAMUELTHERE WAS A CERTAIN MAN OF RAMATHAIMZOPHIM OF THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM WHOSE NAME WAS ELKANAH THE SON OF JEROHAM SON OF ELIHU SON OF TOHU SON OF ZUPH AN EPHRATHITE

HE HAD TWO WIVES

THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS HANNAH AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER PENINNAH

AND PENINNAH HAD CHILDREN BUT HANNAH HAD NO CHILDREN

NOW THIS MAN USED TO GO UP YEAR BY YEAR FROM HIS CITY TO WORSHIP AND TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OF HOSTS AT SHILOH WHERE THE TWO SONS OF ELI HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS WERE PRIESTS OF THE LORD

ON THE DAY WHEN ELKANAH SACRIFICED HE WOULD GIVE PORTIONS TO PENINNAH HIS WIFE AND TO ALL HER SONS AND DAUGHTERS

BUT TO HANNAH HE GAVE A DOUBLE PORTION BECAUSE HE LOVED HER THOUGH THE LORD HAD CLOSED HER WOMB

AND HER RIVAL USED TO PROVOKE HER GRIEVOUSLY TO IRRITATE HER BECAUSE THE LORD HAD CLOSED HER WOMB

SO IT WENT ON YEAR BY YEAR

AS OFTEN AS SHE WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHE USED TO PROVOKE HER

THEREFORE HANNAH WEPT AND WOULD NOT EAT

AND ELKANAH HER HUSBAND SAID TO HER HANNAH WHY DO YOU WEEP

AND WHY DO YOU NOT EAT

AND WHY IS YOUR HEART SAD

AM I NOT MORE TO YOU THAN TEN SONS

 AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNK IN SHILOH HANNAH ROSE

NOW ELI THE PRIEST WAS SITTING ON THE SEAT BESIDE THE DOORPOST OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD

SHE WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED AND PRAYED TO THE LORD AND WEPT BITTERLY

AND SHE VOWED A VOW AND SAID O LORD OF HOSTS IF YOU WILL INDEED LOOK ON THE AFFLICTION OF YOUR SERVANT AND REMEMBER ME AND NOT FORGET YOUR SERVANT BUT WILL GIVE TO YOUR SERVANT A SON THEN I WILL GIVE HIM TO THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE AND NO RAZOR SHALL TOUCH HIS HEAD

 AS SHE CONTINUED PRAYING BEFORE THE LORD ELI OBSERVED HER MOUTH

HANNAH WAS SPEAKING IN HER HEART; ONLY HER LIPS MOVED AND HER VOICE WAS NOT HEARD

THEREFORE ELI TOOK HER TO BE A DRUNKEN WOMAN

AND ELI SAID TO HER HOW LONG WILL YOU GO ON BEING DRUNK

PUT AWAY YOUR WINE FROM YOU

 BUT HANNAH ANSWERED NO MY LORD I AM A WOMAN TROUBLED IN SPIRIT

I HAVE DRUNK NEITHER WINE NOR STRONG DRINK BUT I HAVE BEEN POURING OUT MY SOUL BEFORE THE LORD

DO NOT REGARD YOUR SERVANT AS A WORTHLESS WOMAN FOR ALL ALONG I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT OF MY GREAT ANXIETY AND VEXATION

 THEN ELI ANSWERED GO IN PEACE AND THE GOD OF ISRAEL GRANT YOUR PETITION THAT YOU HAVE MADE TO HIM

 AND SHE SAID LET YOUR SERVANT FIND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES

 THEN THE WOMAN WENT HER WAY AND ATE AND HER FACE WAS NO LONGER SAD

THEY ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WORSHIPED BEFORE THE LORD; THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR HOUSE AT RAMAH

AND ELKANAH KNEW HANNAH HIS WIFE AND THE LORD REMEMBERED HER

AND IN DUE TIME HANNAH CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME SAMUEL FOR SHE SAID I HAVE ASKED FOR HIM FROM THE LORD

 THE MAN ELKANAH AND ALL HIS HOUSE WENT UP TO OFFER TO THE LORD THE YEARLY SACRIFICE AND TO PAY HIS VOW

BUT HANNAH DID NOT GO UP FOR SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CHILD IS WEANED I WILL BRING HIM SO THAT HE MAY APPEAR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD AND DWELL THERE FOREVER

 ELKANAH HER HUSBAND SAID TO HER DO WHAT SEEMS BEST TO YOU; WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE WEANED HIM; ONLY MAY THE LORD ESTABLISH HIS WORD

 SO THE WOMAN REMAINED AND NURSED HER SON UNTIL SHE WEANED HIM

AND WHEN SHE HAD WEANED HIM SHE TOOK HIM UP WITH HER ALONG WITH A THREEYEAROLD BULL AN EPHAH OF FLOUR AND A SKIN OF WINE AND SHE BROUGHT HIM TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AT SHILOH

AND THE CHILD WAS YOUNG

THEN THEY SLAUGHTERED THE BULL AND THEY BROUGHT THE CHILD TO ELI

AND SHE SAID OH MY LORD

AS YOU LIVE MY LORD I AM THE WOMAN WHO WAS STANDING HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE PRAYING TO THE LORD

FOR THIS CHILD I PRAYED AND THE LORD HAS GRANTED ME MY PETITION THAT I MADE TO HIM

THEREFORE I HAVE LENT HIM TO THE LORD

AS LONG AS HE LIVES HE IS LENT TO THE LORD

AND HE WORSHIPED THE LORD THERE

AND HANNAH PRAYED AND SAID MY HEART EXULTS IN THE LORD; MY STRENGTH IS EXALTED IN THE LORD

MY MOUTH DERIDES MY ENEMIES BECAUSE I REJOICE IN YOUR SALVATION

THERE IS NONE HOLY LIKE THE LORD; THERE IS NONE BESIDES YOU; THERE IS NO ROCK LIKE OUR GOD

TALK NO MORE SO VERY PROUDLY LET NOT ARROGANCE COME FROM YOUR MOUTH; FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF KNOWLEDGE AND BY HIM ACTIONS ARE WEIGHED

THE BOWS OF THE MIGHTY ARE BROKEN BUT THE FEEBLE BIND ON STRENGTH

THOSE WHO WERE FULL HAVE HIRED THEMSELVES OUT FOR BREAD BUT THOSE WHO WERE HUNGRY HAVE CEASED TO HUNGER

THE BARREN HAS BORNE SEVEN BUT SHE WHO HAS MANY CHILDREN IS FORLORN

THE LORD KILLS AND BRINGS TO LIFE; HE BRINGS DOWN TO SHEOL AND RAISES UP

THE LORD MAKES POOR AND MAKES RICH; HE BRINGS LOW AND HE EXALTS

HE RAISES UP THE POOR FROM THE DUST; HE LIFTS THE NEEDY FROM THE ASH HEAP TO MAKE THEM SIT WITH PRINCES AND INHERIT A SEAT OF HONOR

FOR THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH ARE THE LORD'S AND ON THEM HE HAS SET THE WORLD

HE WILL GUARD THE FEET OF HIS FAITHFUL ONES BUT THE WICKED SHALL BE CUT OFF IN DARKNESS FOR NOT BY MIGHT SHALL A MAN PREVAIL

THE ADVERSARIES OF THE LORD SHALL BE BROKEN TO PIECES; AGAINST THEM HE WILL THUNDER IN HEAVEN

THE LORD WILL JUDGE THE ENDS OF THE EARTH; HE WILL GIVE STRENGTH TO HIS KING AND EXALT THE POWER OF HIS ANOINTED

 THEN ELKANAH WENT HOME TO RAMAH

AND THE BOY MINISTERED TO THE LORD IN THE PRESENCE OF ELI THE PRIEST

NOW THE SONS OF ELI WERE WORTHLESS MEN

THEY DID NOT KNOW THE LORD

THE CUSTOM OF THE PRIESTS WITH THE PEOPLE WAS THAT WHEN ANY MAN OFFERED SACRIFICE THE PRIEST'S SERVANT WOULD COME WHILE THE MEAT WAS BOILING WITH A THREEPRONGED FORK IN HIS HAND AND HE WOULD THRUST IT INTO THE PAN OR KETTLE OR CAULDRON OR POT

ALL THAT THE FORK BROUGHT UP THE PRIEST WOULD TAKE FOR HIMSELF

THIS IS WHAT THEY DID AT SHILOH TO ALL THE ISRAELITES WHO CAME THERE

MOREOVER BEFORE THE FAT WAS BURNED THE PRIEST'S SERVANT WOULD COME AND SAY TO THE MAN WHO WAS SACRIFICING GIVE MEAT FOR THE PRIEST TO ROAST FOR HE WILL NOT ACCEPT BOILED MEAT FROM YOU BUT ONLY RAW

 AND IF THE MAN SAID TO HIM LET THEM BURN THE FAT FIRST AND THEN TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU WISH HE WOULD SAY NO YOU MUST GIVE IT NOW AND IF NOT I WILL TAKE IT BY FORCE

 THUS THE SIN OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS VERY GREAT IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD FOR THE MEN TREATED THE OFFERING OF THE LORD WITH CONTEMPT

SAMUEL WAS MINISTERING BEFORE THE LORD A BOY CLOTHED WITH A LINEN EPHOD

AND HIS MOTHER USED TO MAKE FOR HIM A LITTLE ROBE AND TAKE IT TO HIM EACH YEAR WHEN SHE WENT UP WITH HER HUSBAND TO OFFER THE YEARLY SACRIFICE

THEN ELI WOULD BLESS ELKANAH AND HIS WIFE AND SAY MAY THE LORD GIVE YOU CHILDREN BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE PETITION SHE ASKED OF THE LORD

 SO THEN THEY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR HOME

INDEED THE LORD VISITED HANNAH AND SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE THREE SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS

AND THE YOUNG MAN SAMUEL GREW IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD

NOW ELI WAS VERY OLD AND HE KEPT HEARING ALL THAT HIS SONS WERE DOING TO ALL ISRAEL AND HOW THEY LAY WITH THE WOMEN WHO WERE SERVING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT OF MEETING

AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY DO YOU DO SUCH THINGS

FOR I HEAR OF YOUR EVIL DEALINGS FROM ALL THE PEOPLE

NO MY SONS; IT IS NO GOOD REPORT THAT I HEAR THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD SPREADING ABROAD

IF SOMEONE SINS AGAINST A MAN GOD WILL MEDIATE FOR HIM BUT IF SOMEONE SINS AGAINST THE LORD WHO CAN INTERCEDE FOR HIM

 BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THEIR FATHER FOR IT WAS THE WILL OF THE LORD TO PUT THEM TO DEATH

NOW THE YOUNG MAN SAMUEL CONTINUED TO GROW BOTH IN STATURE AND IN FAVOR WITH THE LORD AND ALSO WITH MAN

AND THERE CAME A MAN OF GOD TO ELI AND SAID TO HIM THUS THE LORD HAS SAID 'DID I INDEED REVEAL MYSELF TO THE HOUSE OF YOUR FATHER WHEN THEY WERE IN EGYPT SUBJECT TO THE HOUSE OF PHARAOH

DID I CHOOSE HIM OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST TO GO UP TO MY ALTAR TO BURN INCENSE TO WEAR AN EPHOD BEFORE ME

I GAVE TO THE HOUSE OF YOUR FATHER ALL MY OFFERINGS BY FIRE FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

WHY THEN DO YOU SCORN MY SACRIFICES AND MY OFFERINGS THAT I COMMANDED AND HONOR YOUR SONS ABOVE ME BY FATTENING YOURSELVES ON THE CHOICEST PARTS OF EVERY OFFERING OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

' THEREFORE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL DECLARES 'I PROMISED THAT YOUR HOUSE AND THE HOUSE OF YOUR FATHER SHOULD GO IN AND OUT BEFORE ME FOREVER' BUT NOW THE LORD DECLARES 'FAR BE IT FROM ME FOR THOSE WHO HONOR ME I WILL HONOR AND THOSE WHO DESPISE ME SHALL BE LIGHTLY ESTEEMED

BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN I WILL CUT OFF YOUR STRENGTH AND THE STRENGTH OF YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE SO THAT THERE WILL NOT BE AN OLD MAN IN YOUR HOUSE

THEN IN DISTRESS YOU WILL LOOK WITH ENVIOUS EYE ON ALL THE PROSPERITY THAT SHALL BE BESTOWED ON ISRAEL AND THERE SHALL NOT BE AN OLD MAN IN YOUR HOUSE FOREVER

THE ONLY ONE OF YOU WHOM I SHALL NOT CUT OFF FROM MY ALTAR SHALL BE SPARED TO WEEP HIS EYES OUT TO GRIEVE HIS HEART AND ALL THE DESCENDANTS OF YOUR HOUSE SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD OF MEN

AND THIS THAT SHALL COME UPON YOUR TWO SONS HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO YOU BOTH OF THEM SHALL DIE ON THE SAME DAY

AND I WILL RAISE UP FOR MYSELF A FAITHFUL PRIEST WHO SHALL DO ACCORDING TO WHAT IS IN MY HEART AND IN MY MIND

AND I WILL BUILD HIM A SURE HOUSE AND HE SHALL GO IN AND OUT BEFORE MY ANOINTED FOREVER

AND EVERYONE WHO IS LEFT IN YOUR HOUSE SHALL COME TO IMPLORE HIM FOR A PIECE OF SILVER OR A LOAF OF BREAD AND SHALL SAY PLEASE PUT ME IN ONE OF THE PRIESTS' PLACES THAT I MAY EAT A MORSEL OF BREAD

'NOW THE YOUNG MAN SAMUEL WAS MINISTERING TO THE LORD UNDER ELI

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD WAS RARE IN THOSE DAYS; THERE WAS NO FREQUENT VISION

AT THAT TIME ELI WHOSE EYESIGHT HAD BEGUN TO GROW DIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WAS LYING DOWN IN HIS OWN PLACE

THE LAMP OF GOD HAD NOT YET GONE OUT AND SAMUEL WAS LYING DOWN IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD WHERE THE ARK OF GOD WAS

THEN THE LORD CALLED SAMUEL AND HE SAID HERE I AM

 AND RAN TO ELI AND SAID HERE I AM FOR YOU CALLED ME

 BUT HE SAID I DID NOT CALL; LIE DOWN AGAIN

 SO HE WENT AND LAY DOWN

AND THE LORD CALLED AGAIN SAMUEL

 AND SAMUEL AROSE AND WENT TO ELI AND SAID HERE I AM FOR YOU CALLED ME

 BUT HE SAID I DID NOT CALL MY SON; LIE DOWN AGAIN

 NOW SAMUEL DID NOT YET KNOW THE LORD AND THE WORD OF THE LORD HAD NOT YET BEEN REVEALED TO HIM

AND THE LORD CALLED SAMUEL AGAIN THE THIRD TIME

AND HE AROSE AND WENT TO ELI AND SAID HERE I AM FOR YOU CALLED ME

 THEN ELI PERCEIVED THAT THE LORD WAS CALLING THE YOUNG MAN

THEREFORE ELI SAID TO SAMUEL GO LIE DOWN AND IF HE CALLS YOU YOU SHALL SAY 'SPEAK LORD FOR YOUR SERVANT HEARS

' SO SAMUEL WENT AND LAY DOWN IN HIS PLACE

AND THE LORD CAME AND STOOD CALLING AS AT OTHER TIMES SAMUEL

SAMUEL

 AND SAMUEL SAID SPEAK FOR YOUR SERVANT HEARS

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO SAMUEL BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO DO A THING IN ISRAEL AT WHICH THE TWO EARS OF EVERYONE WHO HEARS IT WILL TINGLE

ON THAT DAY I WILL FULFILL AGAINST ELI ALL THAT I HAVE SPOKEN CONCERNING HIS HOUSE FROM BEGINNING TO END

AND I DECLARE TO HIM THAT I AM ABOUT TO PUNISH HIS HOUSE FOREVER FOR THE INIQUITY THAT HE KNEW BECAUSE HIS SONS WERE BLASPHEMING GOD AND HE DID NOT RESTRAIN THEM

THEREFORE I SWEAR TO THE HOUSE OF ELI THAT THE INIQUITY OF ELI'S HOUSE SHALL NOT BE ATONED FOR BY SACRIFICE OR OFFERING FOREVER

 SAMUEL LAY UNTIL MORNING; THEN HE OPENED THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND SAMUEL WAS AFRAID TO TELL THE VISION TO ELI

BUT ELI CALLED SAMUEL AND SAID SAMUEL MY SON

 AND HE SAID HERE I AM

 AND ELI SAID WHAT WAS IT THAT HE TOLD YOU

DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME

MAY GOD DO SO TO YOU AND MORE ALSO IF YOU HIDE ANYTHING FROM ME OF ALL THAT HE TOLD YOU

 SO SAMUEL TOLD HIM EVERYTHING AND HID NOTHING FROM HIM

AND HE SAID IT IS THE LORD

LET HIM DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO HIM

 AND SAMUEL GREW AND THE LORD WAS WITH HIM AND LET NONE OF HIS WORDS FALL TO THE GROUND

AND ALL ISRAEL FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA KNEW THAT SAMUEL WAS ESTABLISHED AS A PROPHET OF THE LORD

AND THE LORD APPEARED AGAIN AT SHILOH FOR THE LORD REVEALED HIMSELF TO SAMUEL AT SHILOH BY THE WORD OF THE LORD

AND THE WORD OF SAMUEL CAME TO ALL ISRAEL

NOW ISRAEL WENT OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

THEY ENCAMPED AT EBENEZER AND THE PHILISTINES ENCAMPED AT APHEK

THE PHILISTINES DREW UP IN LINE AGAINST ISRAEL AND WHEN THE BATTLE SPREAD ISRAEL WAS DEFEATED BY THE PHILISTINES WHO KILLED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE

AND WHEN THE TROOPS CAME TO THE CAMP THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL SAID WHY HAS THE LORD DEFEATED US TODAY BEFORE THE PHILISTINES

LET US BRING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD HERE FROM SHILOH THAT IT MAY COME AMONG US AND SAVE US FROM THE POWER OF OUR ENEMIES

 SO THE PEOPLE SENT TO SHILOH AND BROUGHT FROM THERE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WHO IS ENTHRONED ON THE CHERUBIM

AND THE TWO SONS OF ELI HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS WERE THERE WITH THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF GOD

AS SOON AS THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD CAME INTO THE CAMP ALL ISRAEL GAVE A MIGHTY SHOUT SO THAT THE EARTH RESOUNDED

AND WHEN THE PHILISTINES HEARD THE NOISE OF THE SHOUTING THEY SAID WHAT DOES THIS GREAT SHOUTING IN THE CAMP OF THE HEBREWS MEAN

 AND WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT THE ARK OF THE LORD HAD COME TO THE CAMP THE PHILISTINES WERE AFRAID FOR THEY SAID A GOD HAS COME INTO THE CAMP

 AND THEY SAID WOE TO US

FOR NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE

WOE TO US

WHO CAN DELIVER US FROM THE POWER OF THESE MIGHTY GODS

THESE ARE THE GODS WHO STRUCK THE EGYPTIANS WITH EVERY SORT OF PLAGUE IN THE WILDERNESS

TAKE COURAGE AND BE MEN O PHILISTINES LEST YOU BECOME SLAVES TO THE HEBREWS AS THEY HAVE BEEN TO YOU; BE MEN AND FIGHT

 SO THE PHILISTINES FOUGHT AND ISRAEL WAS DEFEATED AND THEY FLED EVERY MAN TO HIS HOME

AND THERE WAS A VERY GREAT SLAUGHTER FOR THERE FELL OF ISRAEL THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT SOLDIERS

AND THE ARK OF GOD WAS CAPTURED AND THE TWO SONS OF ELI HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS DIED

A MAN OF BENJAMIN RAN FROM THE BATTLE LINE AND CAME TO SHILOH THE SAME DAY WITH HIS CLOTHES TORN AND WITH DIRT ON HIS HEAD

WHEN HE ARRIVED ELI WAS SITTING ON HIS SEAT BY THE ROAD WATCHING FOR HIS HEART TREMBLED FOR THE ARK OF GOD

AND WHEN THE MAN CAME INTO THE CITY AND TOLD THE NEWS ALL THE CITY CRIED OUT

WHEN ELI HEARD THE SOUND OF THE OUTCRY HE SAID WHAT IS THIS UPROAR

 THEN THE MAN HURRIED AND CAME AND TOLD ELI

NOW ELI WAS NINETYEIGHT YEARS OLD AND HIS EYES WERE SET SO THAT HE COULD NOT SEE

AND THE MAN SAID TO ELI I AM HE WHO HAS COME FROM THE BATTLE; I FLED FROM THE BATTLE TODAY

 AND HE SAID HOW DID IT GO MY SON

 HE WHO BROUGHT THE NEWS ANSWERED AND SAID ISRAEL HAS FLED BEFORE THE PHILISTINES AND THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GREAT DEFEAT AMONG THE PEOPLE

YOUR TWO SONS ALSO HOPHNI AND PHINEHAS ARE DEAD AND THE ARK OF GOD HAS BEEN CAPTURED

 AS SOON AS HE MENTIONED THE ARK OF GOD ELI FELL OVER BACKWARD FROM HIS SEAT BY THE SIDE OF THE GATE AND HIS NECK WAS BROKEN AND HE DIED FOR THE MAN WAS OLD AND HEAVY

HE HAD JUDGED ISRAEL FORTY YEARS

NOW HIS DAUGHTERINLAW THE WIFE OF PHINEHAS WAS PREGNANT ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH

AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE NEWS THAT THE ARK OF GOD WAS CAPTURED AND THAT HER FATHERINLAW AND HER HUSBAND WERE DEAD SHE BOWED AND GAVE BIRTH FOR HER PAINS CAME UPON HER

AND ABOUT THE TIME OF HER DEATH THE WOMEN ATTENDING HER SAID TO HER DO NOT BE AFRAID FOR YOU HAVE BORNE A SON

 BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER OR PAY ATTENTION

AND SHE NAMED THE CHILD ICHABOD SAYING THE GLORY HAS DEPARTED FROM ISRAEL

 BECAUSE THE ARK OF GOD HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND BECAUSE OF HER FATHERINLAW AND HER HUSBAND

AND SHE SAID THE GLORY HAS DEPARTED FROM ISRAEL FOR THE ARK OF GOD HAS BEEN CAPTURED

WHEN THE PHILISTINES CAPTURED THE ARK OF GOD THEY BROUGHT IT FROM EBENEZER TO ASHDOD

THEN THE PHILISTINES TOOK THE ARK OF GOD AND BROUGHT IT INTO THE HOUSE OF DAGON AND SET IT UP BESIDE DAGON

AND WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ASHDOD ROSE EARLY THE NEXT DAY BEHOLD DAGON HAD FALLEN FACE DOWNWARD ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD

SO THEY TOOK DAGON AND PUT HIM BACK IN HIS PLACE

BUT WHEN THEY ROSE EARLY ON THE NEXT MORNING BEHOLD DAGON HAD FALLEN FACE DOWNWARD ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD AND THE HEAD OF DAGON AND BOTH HIS HANDS WERE LYING CUT OFF ON THE THRESHOLD

ONLY THE TRUNK OF DAGON WAS LEFT TO HIM

THIS IS WHY THE PRIESTS OF DAGON AND ALL WHO ENTER THE HOUSE OF DAGON DO NOT TREAD ON THE THRESHOLD OF DAGON IN ASHDOD TO THIS DAY

THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS HEAVY AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ASHDOD AND HE TERRIFIED AND AFFLICTED THEM WITH TUMORS BOTH ASHDOD AND ITS TERRITORY

AND WHEN THE MEN OF ASHDOD SAW HOW THINGS WERE THEY SAID THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL MUST NOT REMAIN WITH US FOR HIS HAND IS HARD AGAINST US AND AGAINST DAGON OUR GOD

 SO THEY SENT AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES AND SAID WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL

 THEY ANSWERED LET THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL BE BROUGHT AROUND TO GATH

 SO THEY BROUGHT THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL THERE

BUT AFTER THEY HAD BROUGHT IT AROUND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS AGAINST THE CITY CAUSING A VERY GREAT PANIC AND HE AFFLICTED THE MEN OF THE CITY BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SO THAT TUMORS BROKE OUT ON THEM

SO THEY SENT THE ARK OF GOD TO EKRON

BUT AS SOON AS THE ARK OF GOD CAME TO EKRON THE PEOPLE OF EKRON CRIED OUT THEY HAVE BROUGHT AROUND TO US THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO KILL US AND OUR PEOPLE

 THEY SENT THEREFORE AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES AND SAID SEND AWAY THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL AND LET IT RETURN TO ITS OWN PLACE THAT IT MAY NOT KILL US AND OUR PEOPLE

 FOR THERE WAS A DEATHLY PANIC THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY

THE HAND OF GOD WAS VERY HEAVY THERE

THE MEN WHO DID NOT DIE WERE STRUCK WITH TUMORS AND THE CRY OF THE CITY WENT UP TO HEAVEN

THE ARK OF THE LORD WAS IN THE COUNTRY OF THE PHILISTINES SEVEN MONTHS

AND THE PHILISTINES CALLED FOR THE PRIESTS AND THE DIVINERS AND SAID WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE ARK OF THE LORD

TELL US WITH WHAT WE SHALL SEND IT TO ITS PLACE

 THEY SAID IF YOU SEND AWAY THE ARK OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL DO NOT SEND IT EMPTY BUT BY ALL MEANS RETURN HIM A GUILT OFFERING

THEN YOU WILL BE HEALED AND IT WILL BE KNOWN TO YOU WHY HIS HAND DOES NOT TURN AWAY FROM YOU

 AND THEY SAID WHAT IS THE GUILT OFFERING THAT WE SHALL RETURN TO HIM

 THEY ANSWERED FIVE GOLDEN TUMORS AND FIVE GOLDEN MICE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES FOR THE SAME PLAGUE WAS ON ALL OF YOU AND ON YOUR LORDS

SO YOU MUST MAKE IMAGES OF YOUR TUMORS AND IMAGES OF YOUR MICE THAT RAVAGE THE LAND AND GIVE GLORY TO THE GOD OF ISRAEL

PERHAPS HE WILL LIGHTEN HIS HAND FROM OFF YOU AND YOUR GODS AND YOUR LAND

WHY SHOULD YOU HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS THE EGYPTIANS AND PHARAOH HARDENED THEIR HEARTS

AFTER HE HAD DEALT SEVERELY WITH THEM DID THEY NOT SEND THE PEOPLE AWAY AND THEY DEPARTED

NOW THEN TAKE AND PREPARE A NEW CART AND TWO MILK COWS ON WHICH THERE HAS NEVER COME A YOKE AND YOKE THE COWS TO THE CART BUT TAKE THEIR CALVES HOME AWAY FROM THEM

AND TAKE THE ARK OF THE LORD AND PLACE IT ON THE CART AND PUT IN A BOX AT ITS SIDE THE FIGURES OF GOLD WHICH YOU ARE RETURNING TO HIM AS A GUILT OFFERING

THEN SEND IT OFF AND LET IT GO ITS WAY AND WATCH

IF IT GOES UP ON THE WAY TO ITS OWN LAND TO BETHSHEMESH THEN IT IS HE WHO HAS DONE US THIS GREAT HARM BUT IF NOT THEN WE SHALL KNOW THAT IT IS NOT HIS HAND THAT STRUCK US; IT HAPPENED TO US BY COINCIDENCE

 THE MEN DID SO AND TOOK TWO MILK COWS AND YOKED THEM TO THE CART AND SHUT UP THEIR CALVES AT HOME

AND THEY PUT THE ARK OF THE LORD ON THE CART AND THE BOX WITH THE GOLDEN MICE AND THE IMAGES OF THEIR TUMORS

AND THE COWS WENT STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF BETHSHEMESH ALONG ONE HIGHWAY LOWING AS THEY WENT

THEY TURNED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT AND THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES WENT AFTER THEM AS FAR AS THE BORDER OF BETHSHEMESH

NOW THE PEOPLE OF BETHSHEMESH WERE REAPING THEIR WHEAT HARVEST IN THE VALLEY

AND WHEN THEY LIFTED UP THEIR EYES AND SAW THE ARK THEY REJOICED TO SEE IT

THE CART CAME INTO THE FIELD OF JOSHUA OF BETHSHEMESH AND STOPPED THERE

A GREAT STONE WAS THERE

AND THEY SPLIT UP THE WOOD OF THE CART AND OFFERED THE COWS AS A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD

AND THE LEVITES TOOK DOWN THE ARK OF THE LORD AND THE BOX THAT WAS BESIDE IT IN WHICH WERE THE GOLDEN FIGURES AND SET THEM UPON THE GREAT STONE

AND THE MEN OF BETHSHEMESH OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICED SACRIFICES ON THAT DAY TO THE LORD

AND WHEN THE FIVE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES SAW IT THEY RETURNED THAT DAY TO EKRON

THESE ARE THE GOLDEN TUMORS THAT THE PHILISTINES RETURNED AS A GUILT OFFERING TO THE LORD ONE FOR ASHDOD ONE FOR GAZA ONE FOR ASHKELON ONE FOR GATH ONE FOR EKRON AND THE GOLDEN MICE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF ALL THE CITIES OF THE PHILISTINES BELONGING TO THE FIVE LORDS BOTH FORTIFIED CITIES AND UNWALLED VILLAGES

THE GREAT STONE BESIDE WHICH THEY SET DOWN THE ARK OF THE LORD IS A WITNESS TO THIS DAY IN THE FIELD OF JOSHUA OF BETHSHEMESH

AND HE STRUCK SOME OF THE MEN OF BETHSHEMESH BECAUSE THEY LOOKED UPON THE ARK OF THE LORD

HE STRUCK SEVENTY MEN OF THEM AND THE PEOPLE MOURNED BECAUSE THE LORD HAD STRUCK THE PEOPLE WITH A GREAT BLOW

THEN THE MEN OF BETHSHEMESH SAID WHO IS ABLE TO STAND BEFORE THE LORD THIS HOLY GOD

AND TO WHOM SHALL HE GO UP AWAY FROM US

 SO THEY SENT MESSENGERS TO THE INHABITANTS OF KIRIATHJEARIM SAYING THE PHILISTINES HAVE RETURNED THE ARK OF THE LORD

COME DOWN AND TAKE IT UP TO YOU

AND THE MEN OF KIRIATHJEARIM CAME AND TOOK UP THE ARK OF THE LORD AND BROUGHT IT TO THE HOUSE OF ABINADAB ON THE HILL

AND THEY CONSECRATED HIS SON ELEAZAR TO HAVE CHARGE OF THE ARK OF THE LORD

FROM THE DAY THAT THE ARK WAS LODGED AT KIRIATHJEARIM A LONG TIME PASSED SOME TWENTY YEARS AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL LAMENTED AFTER THE LORD

AND SAMUEL SAID TO ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL IF YOU ARE RETURNING TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART THEN PUT AWAY THE FOREIGN GODS AND THE ASHTAROTH FROM AMONG YOU AND DIRECT YOUR HEART TO THE LORD AND SERVE HIM ONLY AND HE WILL DELIVER YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

 SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL PUT AWAY THE BAALS AND THE ASHTAROTH AND THEY SERVED THE LORD ONLY

THEN SAMUEL SAID GATHER ALL ISRAEL AT MIZPAH AND I WILL PRAY TO THE LORD FOR YOU

 SO THEY GATHERED AT MIZPAH AND DREW WATER AND POURED IT OUT BEFORE THE LORD AND FASTED ON THAT DAY AND SAID THERE WE HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD

 AND SAMUEL JUDGED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT MIZPAH

NOW WHEN THE PHILISTINES HEARD THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD GATHERED AT MIZPAH THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES WENT UP AGAINST ISRAEL

AND WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HEARD OF IT THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE PHILISTINES

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TO SAMUEL DO NOT CEASE TO CRY OUT TO THE LORD OUR GOD FOR US THAT HE MAY SAVE US FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

 SO SAMUEL TOOK A NURSING LAMB AND OFFERED IT AS A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD

AND SAMUEL CRIED OUT TO THE LORD FOR ISRAEL AND THE LORD ANSWERED HIM

AS SAMUEL WAS OFFERING UP THE BURNT OFFERING THE PHILISTINES DREW NEAR TO ATTACK ISRAEL

BUT THE LORD THUNDERED WITH A MIGHTY SOUND THAT DAY AGAINST THE PHILISTINES AND THREW THEM INTO CONFUSION AND THEY WERE ROUTED BEFORE ISRAEL

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WENT OUT FROM MIZPAH AND PURSUED THE PHILISTINES AND STRUCK THEM AS FAR AS BELOW BETHCAR

THEN SAMUEL TOOK A STONE AND SET IT UP BETWEEN MIZPAH AND SHEN AND CALLED ITS NAME EBENEZER; FOR HE SAID TILL NOW THE LORD HAS HELPED US

 SO THE PHILISTINES WERE SUBDUED AND DID NOT AGAIN ENTER THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL

AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS AGAINST THE PHILISTINES ALL THE DAYS OF SAMUEL

THE CITIES THAT THE PHILISTINES HAD TAKEN FROM ISRAEL WERE RESTORED TO ISRAEL FROM EKRON TO GATH AND ISRAEL DELIVERED THEIR TERRITORY FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

THERE WAS PEACE ALSO BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE AMORITES

SAMUEL JUDGED ISRAEL ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE

AND HE WENT ON A CIRCUIT YEAR BY YEAR TO BETHEL GILGAL AND MIZPAH

AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL IN ALL THESE PLACES

THEN HE WOULD RETURN TO RAMAH FOR HIS HOME WAS THERE AND THERE ALSO HE JUDGED ISRAEL

AND HE BUILT THERE AN ALTAR TO THE LORD

WHEN SAMUEL BECAME OLD HE MADE HIS SONS JUDGES OVER ISRAEL

THE NAME OF HIS FIRSTBORN SON WAS JOEL AND THE NAME OF HIS SECOND ABIJAH; THEY WERE JUDGES IN BEERSHEBA

YET HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS BUT TURNED ASIDE AFTER GAIN

THEY TOOK BRIBES AND PERVERTED JUSTICE

THEN ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL GATHERED TOGETHER AND CAME TO SAMUEL AT RAMAH AND SAID TO HIM BEHOLD YOU ARE OLD AND YOUR SONS DO NOT WALK IN YOUR WAYS

NOW APPOINT FOR US A KING TO JUDGE US LIKE ALL THE NATIONS

 BUT THE THING DISPLEASED SAMUEL WHEN THEY SAID GIVE US A KING TO JUDGE US

 AND SAMUEL PRAYED TO THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID TO SAMUEL OBEY THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN ALL THAT THEY SAY TO YOU FOR THEY HAVE NOT REJECTED YOU BUT THEY HAVE REJECTED ME FROM BEING KING OVER THEM

ACCORDING TO ALL THE DEEDS THAT THEY HAVE DONE FROM THE DAY I BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF EGYPT EVEN TO THIS DAY FORSAKING ME AND SERVING OTHER GODS SO THEY ARE ALSO DOING TO YOU

NOW THEN OBEY THEIR VOICE; ONLY YOU SHALL SOLEMNLY WARN THEM AND SHOW THEM THE WAYS OF THE KING WHO SHALL REIGN OVER THEM

 SO SAMUEL TOLD ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ASKING FOR A KING FROM HIM

HE SAID THESE WILL BE THE WAYS OF THE KING WHO WILL REIGN OVER YOU HE WILL TAKE YOUR SONS AND APPOINT THEM TO HIS CHARIOTS AND TO BE HIS HORSEMEN AND TO RUN BEFORE HIS CHARIOTS

AND HE WILL APPOINT FOR HIMSELF COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND COMMANDERS OF FIFTIES AND SOME TO PLOW HIS GROUND AND TO REAP HIS HARVEST AND TO MAKE HIS IMPLEMENTS OF WAR AND THE EQUIPMENT OF HIS CHARIOTS

HE WILL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO BE PERFUMERS AND COOKS AND BAKERS

HE WILL TAKE THE BEST OF YOUR FIELDS AND VINEYARDS AND OLIVE ORCHARDS AND GIVE THEM TO HIS SERVANTS

HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR GRAIN AND OF YOUR VINEYARDS AND GIVE IT TO HIS OFFICERS AND TO HIS SERVANTS

HE WILL TAKE YOUR MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS AND THE BEST OF YOUR YOUNG MEN AND YOUR DONKEYS AND PUT THEM TO HIS WORK

HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR FLOCKS AND YOU SHALL BE HIS SLAVES

AND IN THAT DAY YOU WILL CRY OUT BECAUSE OF YOUR KING WHOM YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOURSELVES BUT THE LORD WILL NOT ANSWER YOU IN THAT DAY

 BUT THE PEOPLE REFUSED TO OBEY THE VOICE OF SAMUEL

AND THEY SAID NO

BUT THERE SHALL BE A KING OVER US THAT WE ALSO MAY BE LIKE ALL THE NATIONS AND THAT OUR KING MAY JUDGE US AND GO OUT BEFORE US AND FIGHT OUR BATTLES

 AND WHEN SAMUEL HAD HEARD ALL THE WORDS OF THE PEOPLE HE REPEATED THEM IN THE EARS OF THE LORD

AND THE LORD SAID TO SAMUEL OBEY THEIR VOICE AND MAKE THEM A KING

 SAMUEL THEN SAID TO THE MEN OF ISRAEL GO EVERY MAN TO HIS CITY

THERE WAS A MAN OF BENJAMIN WHOSE NAME WAS KISH THE SON OF ABIEL SON OF ZEROR SON OF BECORATH SON OF APHIAH A BENJAMINITE A MAN OF WEALTH

AND HE HAD A SON WHOSE NAME WAS SAUL A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN

THERE WAS NOT A MAN AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MORE HANDSOME THAN HE

FROM HIS SHOULDERS UPWARD HE WAS TALLER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE

NOW THE DONKEYS OF KISH SAUL'S FATHER WERE LOST

SO KISH SAID TO SAUL HIS SON TAKE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WITH YOU AND ARISE GO AND LOOK FOR THE DONKEYS

 AND HE PASSED THROUGH THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM AND PASSED THROUGH THE LAND OF SHALISHAH BUT THEY DID NOT FIND THEM

AND THEY PASSED THROUGH THE LAND OF SHAALIM BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE

THEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THE LAND OF BENJAMIN BUT DID NOT FIND THEM

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE LAND OF ZUPH SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANT WHO WAS WITH HIM COME LET US GO BACK LEST MY FATHER CEASE TO CARE ABOUT THE DONKEYS AND BECOME ANXIOUS ABOUT US

 BUT HE SAID TO HIM BEHOLD THERE IS A MAN OF GOD IN THIS CITY AND HE IS A MAN WHO IS HELD IN HONOR; ALL THAT HE SAYS COMES TRUE

SO NOW LET US GO THERE

PERHAPS HE CAN TELL US THE WAY WE SHOULD GO

 THEN SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANT BUT IF WE GO WHAT CAN WE BRING THE MAN

FOR THE BREAD IN OUR SACKS IS GONE AND THERE IS NO PRESENT TO BRING TO THE MAN OF GOD

WHAT DO WE HAVE

 THE SERVANT ANSWERED SAUL AGAIN HERE I HAVE WITH ME A QUARTER OF A SHEKEL OF SILVER AND I WILL GIVE IT TO THE MAN OF GOD TO TELL US OUR WAY

 FORMERLY IN ISRAEL WHEN A MAN WENT TO INQUIRE OF GOD HE SAID COME LET US GO TO THE SEER FOR TODAY'S PROPHET WAS FORMERLY CALLED A SEER

 AND SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANT WELL SAID; COME LET US GO

 SO THEY WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE MAN OF GOD WAS

AS THEY WENT UP THE HILL TO THE CITY THEY MET YOUNG WOMEN COMING OUT TO DRAW WATER AND SAID TO THEM IS THE SEER HERE

 THEY ANSWERED HE IS; BEHOLD HE IS JUST AHEAD OF YOU

HURRY

HE HAS COME JUST NOW TO THE CITY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE A SACRIFICE TODAY ON THE HIGH PLACE

AS SOON AS YOU ENTER THE CITY YOU WILL FIND HIM BEFORE HE GOES UP TO THE HIGH PLACE TO EAT

FOR THE PEOPLE WILL NOT EAT TILL HE COMES SINCE HE MUST BLESS THE SACRIFICE; AFTERWARD THOSE WHO ARE INVITED WILL EAT

NOW GO UP FOR YOU WILL MEET HIM IMMEDIATELY

 SO THEY WENT UP TO THE CITY

AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE CITY THEY SAW SAMUEL COMING OUT TOWARD THEM ON HIS WAY UP TO THE HIGH PLACE

NOW THE DAY BEFORE SAUL CAME THE LORD HAD REVEALED TO SAMUEL TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME I WILL SEND TO YOU A MAN FROM THE LAND OF BENJAMIN AND YOU SHALL ANOINT HIM TO BE PRINCE OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

HE SHALL SAVE MY PEOPLE FROM THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

FOR I HAVE SEEN MY PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR CRY HAS COME TO ME

 WHEN SAMUEL SAW SAUL THE LORD TOLD HIM HERE IS THE MAN OF WHOM I SPOKE TO YOU

HE IT IS WHO SHALL RESTRAIN MY PEOPLE

 THEN SAUL APPROACHED SAMUEL IN THE GATE AND SAID TELL ME WHERE IS THE HOUSE OF THE SEER

 SAMUEL ANSWERED SAUL I AM THE SEER

GO UP BEFORE ME TO THE HIGH PLACE FOR TODAY YOU SHALL EAT WITH ME AND IN THE MORNING I WILL LET YOU GO AND WILL TELL YOU ALL THAT IS ON YOUR MIND

AS FOR YOUR DONKEYS THAT WERE LOST THREE DAYS AGO DO NOT SET YOUR MIND ON THEM FOR THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND

AND FOR WHOM IS ALL THAT IS DESIRABLE IN ISRAEL

IS IT NOT FOR YOU AND FOR ALL YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE

 SAUL ANSWERED AM I NOT A BENJAMINITE FROM THE LEAST OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

AND IS NOT MY CLAN THE HUMBLEST OF ALL THE CLANS OF THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN

WHY THEN HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO ME IN THIS WAY

 THEN SAMUEL TOOK SAUL AND HIS YOUNG MAN AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE HALL AND GAVE THEM A PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INVITED WHO WERE ABOUT THIRTY PERSONS

AND SAMUEL SAID TO THE COOK BRING THE PORTION I GAVE YOU OF WHICH I SAID TO YOU 'PUT IT ASIDE

' SO THE COOK TOOK UP THE LEG AND WHAT WAS ON IT AND SET THEM BEFORE SAUL

AND SAMUEL SAID SEE WHAT WAS KEPT IS SET BEFORE YOU

EAT BECAUSE IT WAS KEPT FOR YOU UNTIL THE HOUR APPOINTED THAT YOU MIGHT EAT WITH THE GUESTS

 SO SAUL ATE WITH SAMUEL THAT DAY

AND WHEN THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE HIGH PLACE INTO THE CITY A BED WAS SPREAD FOR SAUL ON THE ROOF AND HE LAY DOWN TO SLEEP

THEN AT THE BREAK OF DAWN SAMUEL CALLED TO SAUL ON THE ROOF UP THAT I MAY SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY

 SO SAUL AROSE AND BOTH HE AND SAMUEL WENT OUT INTO THE STREET

AS THEY WERE GOING DOWN TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL TELL THE SERVANT TO PASS ON BEFORE US AND WHEN HE HAS PASSED ON STOP HERE YOURSELF FOR A WHILE THAT I MAY MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THE WORD OF GOD

THEN SAMUEL TOOK A FLASK OF OIL AND POURED IT ON HIS HEAD AND KISSED HIM AND SAID HAS NOT THE LORD ANOINTED YOU TO BE PRINCE OVER HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND YOU SHALL REIGN OVER THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD AND YOU WILL SAVE THEM FROM THE HAND OF THEIR SURROUNDING ENEMIES

AND THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO YOU THAT THE LORD HAS ANOINTED YOU TO BE PRINCE OVER HIS HERITAGE

WHEN YOU DEPART FROM ME TODAY YOU WILL MEET TWO MEN BY RACHEL'S TOMB IN THE TERRITORY OF BENJAMIN AT ZELZAH AND THEY WILL SAY TO YOU 'THE DONKEYS THAT YOU WENT TO SEEK ARE FOUND AND NOW YOUR FATHER HAS CEASED TO CARE ABOUT THE DONKEYS AND IS ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU SAYING WHAT SHALL I DO ABOUT MY SON

' THEN YOU SHALL GO ON FROM THERE FURTHER AND COME TO THE OAK OF TABOR

THREE MEN GOING UP TO GOD AT BETHEL WILL MEET YOU THERE ONE CARRYING THREE YOUNG GOATS ANOTHER CARRYING THREE LOAVES OF BREAD AND ANOTHER CARRYING A SKIN OF WINE

AND THEY WILL GREET YOU AND GIVE YOU TWO LOAVES OF BREAD WHICH YOU SHALL ACCEPT FROM THEIR HAND

AFTER THAT YOU SHALL COME TO GIBEATHELOHIM WHERE THERE IS A GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES

AND THERE AS SOON AS YOU COME TO THE CITY YOU WILL MEET A GROUP OF PROPHETS COMING DOWN FROM THE HIGH PLACE WITH HARP TAMBOURINE FLUTE AND LYRE BEFORE THEM PROPHESYING

THEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WILL RUSH UPON YOU AND YOU WILL PROPHESY WITH THEM AND BE TURNED INTO ANOTHER MAN

NOW WHEN THESE SIGNS MEET YOU DO WHAT YOUR HAND FINDS TO DO FOR GOD IS WITH YOU

THEN GO DOWN BEFORE ME TO GILGAL

AND BEHOLD I AM COMING TO YOU TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS AND TO SACRIFICE PEACE OFFERINGS

SEVEN DAYS YOU SHALL WAIT UNTIL I COME TO YOU AND SHOW YOU WHAT YOU SHALL DO

 WHEN HE TURNED HIS BACK TO LEAVE SAMUEL GOD GAVE HIM ANOTHER HEART

AND ALL THESE SIGNS CAME TO PASS THAT DAY

WHEN THEY CAME TO GIBEAH BEHOLD A GROUP OF PROPHETS MET HIM AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD RUSHED UPON HIM AND HE PROPHESIED AMONG THEM

AND WHEN ALL WHO KNEW HIM PREVIOUSLY SAW HOW HE PROPHESIED WITH THE PROPHETS THE PEOPLE SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT HAS COME OVER THE SON OF KISH

IS SAUL ALSO AMONG THE PROPHETS

 AND A MAN OF THE PLACE ANSWERED AND WHO IS THEIR FATHER

 THEREFORE IT BECAME A PROVERB IS SAUL ALSO AMONG THE PROPHETS

 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED PROPHESYING HE CAME TO THE HIGH PLACE

SAUL'S UNCLE SAID TO HIM AND TO HIS SERVANT WHERE DID YOU GO

 AND HE SAID TO SEEK THE DONKEYS

AND WHEN WE SAW THEY WERE NOT TO BE FOUND WE WENT TO SAMUEL

 AND SAUL'S UNCLE SAID PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SAMUEL SAID TO YOU

 AND SAUL SAID TO HIS UNCLE HE TOLD US PLAINLY THAT THE DONKEYS HAD BEEN FOUND

 BUT ABOUT THE MATTER OF THE KINGDOM OF WHICH SAMUEL HAD SPOKEN HE DID NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING

NOW SAMUEL CALLED THE PEOPLE TOGETHER TO THE LORD AT MIZPAH

AND HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'I BROUGHT UP ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT AND I DELIVERED YOU FROM THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND FROM THE HAND OF ALL THE KINGDOMS THAT WERE OPPRESSING YOU

' BUT TODAY YOU HAVE REJECTED YOUR GOD WHO SAVES YOU FROM ALL YOUR CALAMITIES AND YOUR DISTRESSES AND YOU HAVE SAID TO HIM 'SET A KING OVER US

' NOW THEREFORE PRESENT YOURSELVES BEFORE THE LORD BY YOUR TRIBES AND BY YOUR THOUSANDS

 THEN SAMUEL BROUGHT ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL NEAR AND THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN WAS TAKEN BY LOT

HE BROUGHT THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN NEAR BY ITS CLANS AND THE CLAN OF THE MATRITES WAS TAKEN BY LOT; AND SAUL THE SON OF KISH WAS TAKEN BY LOT

BUT WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM HE COULD NOT BE FOUND

SO THEY INQUIRED AGAIN OF THE LORD IS THERE A MAN STILL TO COME

 AND THE LORD SAID BEHOLD HE HAS HIDDEN HIMSELF AMONG THE BAGGAGE

 THEN THEY RAN AND TOOK HIM FROM THERE

AND WHEN HE STOOD AMONG THE PEOPLE HE WAS TALLER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE FROM HIS SHOULDERS UPWARD

AND SAMUEL SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE DO YOU SEE HIM WHOM THE LORD HAS CHOSEN

THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE

 AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHOUTED LONG LIVE THE KING

 THEN SAMUEL TOLD THE PEOPLE THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE KINGSHIP AND HE WROTE THEM IN A BOOK AND LAID IT UP BEFORE THE LORD

THEN SAMUEL SENT ALL THE PEOPLE AWAY EACH ONE TO HIS HOME

SAUL ALSO WENT TO HIS HOME AT GIBEAH AND WITH HIM WENT MEN OF VALOR WHOSE HEARTS GOD HAD TOUCHED

BUT SOME WORTHLESS FELLOWS SAID HOW CAN THIS MAN SAVE US

 AND THEY DESPISED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM NO PRESENT

BUT HE HELD HIS PEACE

THEN NAHASH THE AMMONITE WENT UP AND BESIEGED JABESHGILEAD AND ALL THE MEN OF JABESH SAID TO NAHASH MAKE A TREATY WITH US AND WE WILL SERVE YOU

 BUT NAHASH THE AMMONITE SAID TO THEM ON THIS CONDITION I WILL MAKE A TREATY WITH YOU THAT I GOUGE OUT ALL YOUR RIGHT EYES AND THUS BRING DISGRACE ON ALL ISRAEL

 THE ELDERS OF JABESH SAID TO HIM GIVE US SEVEN DAYS RESPITE THAT WE MAY SEND MESSENGERS THROUGH ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL

THEN IF THERE IS NO ONE TO SAVE US WE WILL GIVE OURSELVES UP TO YOU

 WHEN THE MESSENGERS CAME TO GIBEAH OF SAUL THEY REPORTED THE MATTER IN THE EARS OF THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE PEOPLE WEPT ALOUD

NOW BEHOLD SAUL WAS COMING FROM THE FIELD BEHIND THE OXEN

AND SAUL SAID WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE WEEPING

 SO THEY TOLD HIM THE NEWS OF THE MEN OF JABESH

AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD RUSHED UPON SAUL WHEN HE HEARD THESE WORDS AND HIS ANGER WAS GREATLY KINDLED

HE TOOK A YOKE OF OXEN AND CUT THEM IN PIECES AND SENT THEM THROUGHOUT ALL THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL BY THE HAND OF MESSENGERS SAYING WHOEVER DOES NOT COME OUT AFTER SAUL AND SAMUEL SO SHALL IT BE DONE TO HIS OXEN

 THEN THE DREAD OF THE LORD FELL UPON THE PEOPLE AND THEY CAME OUT AS ONE MAN

WHEN HE MUSTERED THEM AT BEZEK THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE MEN OF JUDAH THIRTY THOUSAND

AND THEY SAID TO THE MESSENGERS WHO HAD COME THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THE MEN OF JABESHGILEAD 'TOMORROW BY THE TIME THE SUN IS HOT YOU SHALL HAVE DELIVERANCE

' WHEN THE MESSENGERS CAME AND TOLD THE MEN OF JABESH THEY WERE GLAD

THEREFORE THE MEN OF JABESH SAID TOMORROW WE WILL GIVE OURSELVES UP TO YOU AND YOU MAY DO TO US WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

 AND THE NEXT DAY SAUL PUT THE PEOPLE IN THREE COMPANIES

AND THEY CAME INTO THE MIDST OF THE CAMP IN THE MORNING WATCH AND STRUCK DOWN THE AMMONITES UNTIL THE HEAT OF THE DAY

AND THOSE WHO SURVIVED WERE SCATTERED SO THAT NO TWO OF THEM WERE LEFT TOGETHER

THEN THE PEOPLE SAID TO SAMUEL WHO IS IT THAT SAID 'SHALL SAUL REIGN OVER US

' BRING THE MEN THAT WE MAY PUT THEM TO DEATH

 BUT SAUL SAID NOT A MAN SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH THIS DAY FOR TODAY THE LORD HAS WORKED SALVATION IN ISRAEL

 THEN SAMUEL SAID TO THE PEOPLE COME LET US GO TO GILGAL AND THERE RENEW THE KINGDOM

 SO ALL THE PEOPLE WENT TO GILGAL AND THERE THEY MADE SAUL KING BEFORE THE LORD IN GILGAL

THERE THEY SACRIFICED PEACE OFFERINGS BEFORE THE LORD AND THERE SAUL AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL REJOICED GREATLY

AND SAMUEL SAID TO ALL ISRAEL BEHOLD I HAVE OBEYED YOUR VOICE IN ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID TO ME AND HAVE MADE A KING OVER YOU

AND NOW BEHOLD THE KING WALKS BEFORE YOU AND I AM OLD AND GRAY; AND BEHOLD MY SONS ARE WITH YOU

I HAVE WALKED BEFORE YOU FROM MY YOUTH UNTIL THIS DAY

HERE I AM; TESTIFY AGAINST ME BEFORE THE LORD AND BEFORE HIS ANOINTED

WHOSE OX HAVE I TAKEN

OR WHOSE DONKEY HAVE I TAKEN

OR WHOM HAVE I DEFRAUDED

WHOM HAVE I OPPRESSED

OR FROM WHOSE HAND HAVE I TAKEN A BRIBE TO BLIND MY EYES WITH IT

TESTIFY AGAINST ME AND I WILL RESTORE IT TO YOU

 THEY SAID YOU HAVE NOT DEFRAUDED US OR OPPRESSED US OR TAKEN ANYTHING FROM ANY MAN'S HAND

 AND HE SAID TO THEM THE LORD IS WITNESS AGAINST YOU AND HIS ANOINTED IS WITNESS THIS DAY THAT YOU HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING IN MY HAND

 AND THEY SAID HE IS WITNESS

 AND SAMUEL SAID TO THE PEOPLE THE LORD IS WITNESS WHO APPOINTED MOSES AND AARON AND BROUGHT YOUR FATHERS UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

NOW THEREFORE STAND STILL THAT I MAY PLEAD WITH YOU BEFORE THE LORD CONCERNING ALL THE RIGHTEOUS DEEDS OF THE LORD THAT HE PERFORMED FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR FATHERS

WHEN JACOB WENT INTO EGYPT AND THE EGYPTIANS OPPRESSED THEM THEN YOUR FATHERS CRIED OUT TO THE LORD AND THE LORD SENT MOSES AND AARON WHO BROUGHT YOUR FATHERS OUT OF EGYPT AND MADE THEM DWELL IN THIS PLACE

BUT THEY FORGOT THE LORD THEIR GOD

AND HE SOLD THEM INTO THE HAND OF SISERA COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF HAZOR AND INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF MOAB

AND THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THEM

AND THEY CRIED OUT TO THE LORD AND SAID 'WE HAVE SINNED BECAUSE WE HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD AND HAVE SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASHTAROTH

BUT NOW DELIVER US OUT OF THE HAND OF OUR ENEMIES THAT WE MAY SERVE YOU

' AND THE LORD SENT JERUBBAAL AND BARAK AND JEPHTHAH AND SAMUEL AND DELIVERED YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF YOUR ENEMIES ON EVERY SIDE AND YOU LIVED IN SAFETY

AND WHEN YOU SAW THAT NAHASH THE KING OF THE AMMONITES CAME AGAINST YOU YOU SAID TO ME 'NO BUT A KING SHALL REIGN OVER US' WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD WAS YOUR KING

AND NOW BEHOLD THE KING WHOM YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR WHOM YOU HAVE ASKED; BEHOLD THE LORD HAS SET A KING OVER YOU

IF YOU WILL FEAR THE LORD AND SERVE HIM AND OBEY HIS VOICE AND NOT REBEL AGAINST THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD AND IF BOTH YOU AND THE KING WHO REIGNS OVER YOU WILL FOLLOW THE LORD YOUR GOD IT WILL BE WELL

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD BUT REBEL AGAINST THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD THEN THE HAND OF THE LORD WILL BE AGAINST YOU AND YOUR KING

NOW THEREFORE STAND STILL AND SEE THIS GREAT THING THAT THE LORD WILL DO BEFORE YOUR EYES

IS IT NOT WHEAT HARVEST TODAY

I WILL CALL UPON THE LORD THAT HE MAY SEND THUNDER AND RAIN

AND YOU SHALL KNOW AND SEE THAT YOUR WICKEDNESS IS GREAT WHICH YOU HAVE DONE IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD IN ASKING FOR YOURSELVES A KING

 SO SAMUEL CALLED UPON THE LORD AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND RAIN THAT DAY AND ALL THE PEOPLE GREATLY FEARED THE LORD AND SAMUEL

AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID TO SAMUEL PRAY FOR YOUR SERVANTS TO THE LORD YOUR GOD THAT WE MAY NOT DIE FOR WE HAVE ADDED TO ALL OUR SINS THIS EVIL TO ASK FOR OURSELVES A KING

 AND SAMUEL SAID TO THE PEOPLE DO NOT BE AFRAID; YOU HAVE DONE ALL THIS EVIL

YET DO NOT TURN ASIDE FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD BUT SERVE THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART

AND DO NOT TURN ASIDE AFTER EMPTY THINGS THAT CANNOT PROFIT OR DELIVER FOR THEY ARE EMPTY

FOR THE LORD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS PEOPLE FOR HIS GREAT NAME'S SAKE BECAUSE IT HAS PLEASED THE LORD TO MAKE YOU A PEOPLE FOR HIMSELF

MOREOVER AS FOR ME FAR BE IT FROM ME THAT I SHOULD SIN AGAINST THE LORD BY CEASING TO PRAY FOR YOU AND I WILL INSTRUCT YOU IN THE GOOD AND THE RIGHT WAY

ONLY FEAR THE LORD AND SERVE HIM FAITHFULLY WITH ALL YOUR HEART

FOR CONSIDER WHAT GREAT THINGS HE HAS DONE FOR YOU

BUT IF YOU STILL DO WICKEDLY YOU SHALL BE SWEPT AWAY BOTH YOU AND YOUR KING

SAUL WAS





YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED





AND TWO YEARS OVER ISRAEL

SAUL CHOSE THREE THOUSAND MEN OF ISRAEL

TWO THOUSAND WERE WITH SAUL IN MICHMASH AND THE HILL COUNTRY OF BETHEL AND A THOUSAND WERE WITH JONATHAN IN GIBEAH OF BENJAMIN

THE REST OF THE PEOPLE HE SENT HOME EVERY MAN TO HIS TENT

JONATHAN DEFEATED THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES THAT WAS AT GEBA AND THE PHILISTINES HEARD OF IT

AND SAUL BLEW THE TRUMPET THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND SAYING LET THE HEBREWS HEAR

 AND ALL ISRAEL HEARD IT SAID THAT SAUL HAD DEFEATED THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES AND ALSO THAT ISRAEL HAD BECOME A STENCH TO THE PHILISTINES

AND THE PEOPLE WERE CALLED OUT TO JOIN SAUL AT GILGAL

AND THE PHILISTINES MUSTERED TO FIGHT WITH ISRAEL THIRTY THOUSAND CHARIOTS AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND TROOPS LIKE THE SAND ON THE SEASHORE IN MULTITUDE

THEY CAME UP AND ENCAMPED IN MICHMASH TO THE EAST OF BETHAVEN

WHEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAW THAT THEY WERE IN TROUBLE FOR THE PEOPLE WERE HARD PRESSED THE PEOPLE HID THEMSELVES IN CAVES AND IN HOLES AND IN ROCKS AND IN TOMBS AND IN CISTERNS AND SOME HEBREWS CROSSED THE FORDS OF THE JORDAN TO THE LAND OF GAD AND GILEAD

SAUL WAS STILL AT GILGAL AND ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM TREMBLING

HE WAITED SEVEN DAYS THE TIME APPOINTED BY SAMUEL

BUT SAMUEL DID NOT COME TO GILGAL AND THE PEOPLE WERE SCATTERING FROM HIM

SO SAUL SAID BRING THE BURNT OFFERING HERE TO ME AND THE PEACE OFFERINGS

 AND HE OFFERED THE BURNT OFFERING

AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED OFFERING THE BURNT OFFERING BEHOLD SAMUEL CAME

AND SAUL WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND GREET HIM

SAMUEL SAID WHAT HAVE YOU DONE

 AND SAUL SAID WHEN I SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE SCATTERING FROM ME AND THAT YOU DID NOT COME WITHIN THE DAYS APPOINTED AND THAT THE PHILISTINES HAD MUSTERED AT MICHMASH I SAID 'NOW THE PHILISTINES WILL COME DOWN AGAINST ME AT GILGAL AND I HAVE NOT SOUGHT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD

' SO I FORCED MYSELF AND OFFERED THE BURNT OFFERING

 AND SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL YOU HAVE DONE FOOLISHLY

YOU HAVE NOT KEPT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH WHICH HE COMMANDED YOU

FOR THEN THE LORD WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED YOUR KINGDOM OVER ISRAEL FOREVER

BUT NOW YOUR KINGDOM SHALL NOT CONTINUE

THE LORD HAS SOUGHT OUT A MAN AFTER HIS OWN HEART AND THE LORD HAS COMMANDED HIM TO BE PRINCE OVER HIS PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT KEPT WHAT THE LORD COMMANDED YOU

 AND SAMUEL AROSE AND WENT UP FROM GILGAL

THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WENT UP AFTER SAUL TO MEET THE ARMY; THEY WENT UP FROM GILGAL TO GIBEAH OF BENJAMIN

AND SAUL NUMBERED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PRESENT WITH HIM ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MEN

AND SAUL AND JONATHAN HIS SON AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PRESENT WITH THEM STAYED IN GEBA OF BENJAMIN BUT THE PHILISTINES ENCAMPED IN MICHMASH

AND RAIDERS CAME OUT OF THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES IN THREE COMPANIES

ONE COMPANY TURNED TOWARD OPHRAH TO THE LAND OF SHUAL; ANOTHER COMPANY TURNED TOWARD BETHHORON; AND ANOTHER COMPANY TURNED TOWARD THE BORDER THAT LOOKS DOWN ON THE VALLEY OF ZEBOIM TOWARD THE WILDERNESS

NOW THERE WAS NO BLACKSMITH TO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF ISRAEL FOR THE PHILISTINES SAID LEST THE HEBREWS MAKE THEMSELVES SWORDS OR SPEARS

 BUT EVERY ONE OF THE ISRAELITES WENT DOWN TO THE PHILISTINES TO SHARPEN HIS PLOWSHARE HIS MATTOCK HIS AXE OR HIS SICKLE AND THE CHARGE WAS TWOTHIRDS OF A SHEKEL FOR THE PLOWSHARES AND FOR THE MATTOCKS AND A THIRD OF A SHEKEL FOR SHARPENING THE AXES AND FOR SETTING THE GOADS

SO ON THE DAY OF THE BATTLE THERE WAS NEITHER SWORD NOR SPEAR FOUND IN THE HAND OF ANY OF THE PEOPLE WITH SAUL AND JONATHAN BUT SAUL AND JONATHAN HIS SON HAD THEM

AND THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES WENT OUT TO THE PASS OF MICHMASH

ONE DAY JONATHAN THE SON OF SAUL SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO CARRIED HIS ARMOR COME LET US GO OVER TO THE PHILISTINE GARRISON ON THE OTHER SIDE

 BUT HE DID NOT TELL HIS FATHER

SAUL WAS STAYING IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF GIBEAH IN THE POMEGRANATE CAVE AT MIGRON

THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM WERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MEN INCLUDING AHIJAH THE SON OF AHITUB ICHABOD'S BROTHER SON OF PHINEHAS SON OF ELI THE PRIEST OF THE LORD IN SHILOH WEARING AN EPHOD

AND THE PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THAT JONATHAN HAD GONE

WITHIN THE PASSES BY WHICH JONATHAN SOUGHT TO GO OVER TO THE PHILISTINE GARRISON THERE WAS A ROCKY CRAG ON THE ONE SIDE AND A ROCKY CRAG ON THE OTHER SIDE

THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS BOZEZ AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER SENEH

THE ONE CRAG ROSE ON THE NORTH IN FRONT OF MICHMASH AND THE OTHER ON THE SOUTH IN FRONT OF GEBA

JONATHAN SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO CARRIED HIS ARMOR COME LET US GO OVER TO THE GARRISON OF THESE UNCIRCUMCISED

IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD WILL WORK FOR US FOR NOTHING CAN HINDER THE LORD FROM SAVING BY MANY OR BY FEW

 AND HIS ARMORBEARER SAID TO HIM DO ALL THAT IS IN YOUR HEART

DO AS YOU WISH

BEHOLD I AM WITH YOU HEART AND SOUL

 THEN JONATHAN SAID BEHOLD WE WILL CROSS OVER TO THE MEN AND WE WILL SHOW OURSELVES TO THEM

IF THEY SAY TO US 'WAIT UNTIL WE COME TO YOU' THEN WE WILL STAND STILL IN OUR PLACE AND WE WILL NOT GO UP TO THEM

BUT IF THEY SAY 'COME UP TO US' THEN WE WILL GO UP FOR THE LORD HAS GIVEN THEM INTO OUR HAND

AND THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO US

 SO BOTH OF THEM SHOWED THEMSELVES TO THE GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES

AND THE PHILISTINES SAID LOOK HEBREWS ARE COMING OUT OF THE HOLES WHERE THEY HAVE HIDDEN THEMSELVES

 AND THE MEN OF THE GARRISON HAILED JONATHAN AND HIS ARMORBEARER AND SAID COME UP TO US AND WE WILL SHOW YOU A THING

 AND JONATHAN SAID TO HIS ARMORBEARER COME UP AFTER ME FOR THE LORD HAS GIVEN THEM INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL

 THEN JONATHAN CLIMBED UP ON HIS HANDS AND FEET AND HIS ARMORBEARER AFTER HIM

AND THEY FELL BEFORE JONATHAN AND HIS ARMORBEARER KILLED THEM AFTER HIM

AND THAT FIRST STRIKE WHICH JONATHAN AND HIS ARMORBEARER MADE KILLED ABOUT TWENTY MEN WITHIN AS IT WERE HALF A FURROW'S LENGTH IN AN ACRE OF LAND

AND THERE WAS A PANIC IN THE CAMP IN THE FIELD AND AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE

THE GARRISON AND EVEN THE RAIDERS TREMBLED THE EARTH QUAKED AND IT BECAME A VERY GREAT PANIC

AND THE WATCHMEN OF SAUL IN GIBEAH OF BENJAMIN LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE MULTITUDE WAS DISPERSING HERE AND THERE

THEN SAUL SAID TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM COUNT AND SEE WHO HAS GONE FROM US

 AND WHEN THEY HAD COUNTED BEHOLD JONATHAN AND HIS ARMORBEARER WERE NOT THERE

SO SAUL SAID TO AHIJAH BRING THE ARK OF GOD HERE

 FOR THE ARK OF GOD WENT AT THAT TIME WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

NOW WHILE SAUL WAS TALKING TO THE PRIEST THE TUMULT IN THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES INCREASED MORE AND MORE

SO SAUL SAID TO THE PRIEST WITHDRAW YOUR HAND

 THEN SAUL AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM RALLIED AND WENT INTO THE BATTLE

AND BEHOLD EVERY PHILISTINE'S SWORD WAS AGAINST HIS FELLOW AND THERE WAS VERY GREAT CONFUSION

NOW THE HEBREWS WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE PHILISTINES BEFORE THAT TIME AND WHO HAD GONE UP WITH THEM INTO THE CAMP EVEN THEY ALSO TURNED TO BE WITH THE ISRAELITES WHO WERE WITH SAUL AND JONATHAN

LIKEWISE WHEN ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL WHO HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM HEARD THAT THE PHILISTINES WERE FLEEING THEY TOO FOLLOWED HARD AFTER THEM IN THE BATTLE

SO THE LORD SAVED ISRAEL THAT DAY

AND THE BATTLE PASSED BEYOND BETHAVEN

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN HARD PRESSED THAT DAY SO SAUL HAD LAID AN OATH ON THE PEOPLE SAYING CURSED BE THE MAN WHO EATS FOOD UNTIL IT IS EVENING AND I AM AVENGED ON MY ENEMIES

 SO NONE OF THE PEOPLE HAD TASTED FOOD

NOW WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE CAME TO THE FOREST BEHOLD THERE WAS HONEY ON THE GROUND

AND WHEN THE PEOPLE ENTERED THE FOREST BEHOLD THE HONEY WAS DROPPING BUT NO ONE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH FOR THE PEOPLE FEARED THE OATH

BUT JONATHAN HAD NOT HEARD HIS FATHER CHARGE THE PEOPLE WITH THE OATH SO HE PUT OUT THE TIP OF THE STAFF THAT WAS IN HIS HAND AND DIPPED IT IN THE HONEYCOMB AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES BECAME BRIGHT

THEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID YOUR FATHER STRICTLY CHARGED THE PEOPLE WITH AN OATH SAYING 'CURSED BE THE MAN WHO EATS FOOD THIS DAY

' AND THE PEOPLE WERE FAINT

THEN JONATHAN SAID MY FATHER HAS TROUBLED THE LAND

SEE HOW MY EYES HAVE BECOME BRIGHT BECAUSE I TASTED A LITTLE OF THIS HONEY

HOW MUCH BETTER IF THE PEOPLE HAD EATEN FREELY TODAY OF THE SPOIL OF THEIR ENEMIES THAT THEY FOUND

FOR NOW THE DEFEAT AMONG THE PHILISTINES HAS NOT BEEN GREAT

 THEY STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINES THAT DAY FROM MICHMASH TO AIJALON

AND THE PEOPLE WERE VERY FAINT

THE PEOPLE POUNCED ON THE SPOIL AND TOOK SHEEP AND OXEN AND CALVES AND SLAUGHTERED THEM ON THE GROUND

AND THE PEOPLE ATE THEM WITH THE BLOOD

THEN THEY TOLD SAUL BEHOLD THE PEOPLE ARE SINNING AGAINST THE LORD BY EATING WITH THE BLOOD

 AND HE SAID YOU HAVE DEALT TREACHEROUSLY; ROLL A GREAT STONE TO ME HERE

 AND SAUL SAID DISPERSE YOURSELVES AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SAY TO THEM 'LET EVERY MAN BRING HIS OX OR HIS SHEEP AND SLAUGHTER THEM HERE AND EAT AND DO NOT SIN AGAINST THE LORD BY EATING WITH THE BLOOD

' SO EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE BROUGHT HIS OX WITH HIM THAT NIGHT AND THEY SLAUGHTERED THEM THERE

AND SAUL BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD; IT WAS THE FIRST ALTAR THAT HE BUILT TO THE LORD

THEN SAUL SAID LET US GO DOWN AFTER THE PHILISTINES BY NIGHT AND PLUNDER THEM UNTIL THE MORNING LIGHT; LET US NOT LEAVE A MAN OF THEM

 AND THEY SAID DO WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

 BUT THE PRIEST SAID LET US DRAW NEAR TO GOD HERE

 AND SAUL INQUIRED OF GOD SHALL I GO DOWN AFTER THE PHILISTINES

WILL YOU GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL

 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER HIM THAT DAY

AND SAUL SAID COME HERE ALL YOU LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE AND KNOW AND SEE HOW THIS SIN HAS ARISEN TODAY

FOR AS THE LORD LIVES WHO SAVES ISRAEL THOUGH IT BE IN JONATHAN MY SON HE SHALL SURELY DIE

 BUT THERE WAS NOT A MAN AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ANSWERED HIM

THEN HE SAID TO ALL ISRAEL YOU SHALL BE ON ONE SIDE AND I AND JONATHAN MY SON WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE

 AND THE PEOPLE SAID TO SAUL DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD TO YOU

 THEREFORE SAUL SAID O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL WHY HAVE YOU NOT ANSWERED YOUR SERVANT THIS DAY

IF THIS GUILT IS IN ME OR IN JONATHAN MY SON O LORD GOD OF ISRAEL GIVE URIM

BUT IF THIS GUILT IS IN YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL GIVE THUMMIM

 AND JONATHAN AND SAUL WERE TAKEN BUT THE PEOPLE ESCAPED

THEN SAUL SAID CAST THE LOT BETWEEN ME AND MY SON JONATHAN

 AND JONATHAN WAS TAKEN

THEN SAUL SAID TO JONATHAN TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE

 AND JONATHAN TOLD HIM I TASTED A LITTLE HONEY WITH THE TIP OF THE STAFF THAT WAS IN MY HAND

HERE I AM; I WILL DIE

 AND SAUL SAID GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO; YOU SHALL SURELY DIE JONATHAN

 THEN THE PEOPLE SAID TO SAUL SHALL JONATHAN DIE WHO HAS WORKED THIS GREAT SALVATION IN ISRAEL

FAR FROM IT

AS THE LORD LIVES THERE SHALL NOT ONE HAIR OF HIS HEAD FALL TO THE GROUND FOR HE HAS WORKED WITH GOD THIS DAY

 SO THE PEOPLE RANSOMED JONATHAN SO THAT HE DID NOT DIE

THEN SAUL WENT UP FROM PURSUING THE PHILISTINES AND THE PHILISTINES WENT TO THEIR OWN PLACE

WHEN SAUL HAD TAKEN THE KINGSHIP OVER ISRAEL HE FOUGHT AGAINST ALL HIS ENEMIES ON EVERY SIDE AGAINST MOAB AGAINST THE AMMONITES AGAINST EDOM AGAINST THE KINGS OF ZOBAH AND AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

WHEREVER HE TURNED HE ROUTED THEM

AND HE DID VALIANTLY AND STRUCK THE AMALEKITES AND DELIVERED ISRAEL OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO PLUNDERED THEM

NOW THE SONS OF SAUL WERE JONATHAN ISHVI AND MALCHISHUA

AND THE NAMES OF HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WERE THESE THE NAME OF THE FIRSTBORN WAS MERAB AND THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER MICHAL

AND THE NAME OF SAUL'S WIFE WAS AHINOAM THE DAUGHTER OF AHIMAAZ

AND THE NAME OF THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY WAS ABNER THE SON OF NER SAUL'S UNCLE

KISH WAS THE FATHER OF SAUL AND NER THE FATHER OF ABNER WAS THE SON OF ABIEL

THERE WAS HARD FIGHTING AGAINST THE PHILISTINES ALL THE DAYS OF SAUL

AND WHEN SAUL SAW ANY STRONG MAN OR ANY VALIANT MAN HE ATTACHED HIM TO HIMSELF

AND SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL THE LORD SENT ME TO ANOINT YOU KING OVER HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL; NOW THEREFORE LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS 'I HAVE NOTED WHAT AMALEK DID TO ISRAEL IN OPPOSING THEM ON THE WAY WHEN THEY CAME UP OUT OF EGYPT

NOW GO AND STRIKE AMALEK AND DEVOTE TO DESTRUCTION ALL THAT THEY HAVE

DO NOT SPARE THEM BUT KILL BOTH MAN AND WOMAN CHILD AND INFANT OX AND SHEEP CAMEL AND DONKEY

' SO SAUL SUMMONED THE PEOPLE AND NUMBERED THEM IN TELAIM TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT AND TEN THOUSAND MEN OF JUDAH

AND SAUL CAME TO THE CITY OF AMALEK AND LAY IN WAIT IN THE VALLEY

THEN SAUL SAID TO THE KENITES GO DEPART; GO DOWN FROM AMONG THE AMALEKITES LEST I DESTROY YOU WITH THEM

FOR YOU SHOWED KINDNESS TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY CAME UP OUT OF EGYPT

 SO THE KENITES DEPARTED FROM AMONG THE AMALEKITES

AND SAUL DEFEATED THE AMALEKITES FROM HAVILAH AS FAR AS SHUR WHICH IS EAST OF EGYPT

AND HE TOOK AGAG THE KING OF THE AMALEKITES ALIVE AND DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION ALL THE PEOPLE WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

BUT SAUL AND THE PEOPLE SPARED AGAG AND THE BEST OF THE SHEEP AND OF THE OXEN AND OF THE FATTENED CALVES AND THE LAMBS AND ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND WOULD NOT UTTERLY DESTROY THEM

ALL THAT WAS DESPISED AND WORTHLESS THEY DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO SAMUEL I REGRET THAT I HAVE MADE SAUL KING FOR HE HAS TURNED BACK FROM FOLLOWING ME AND HAS NOT PERFORMED MY COMMANDMENTS

 AND SAMUEL WAS ANGRY AND HE CRIED TO THE LORD ALL NIGHT

AND SAMUEL ROSE EARLY TO MEET SAUL IN THE MORNING

AND IT WAS TOLD SAMUEL SAUL CAME TO CARMEL AND BEHOLD HE SET UP A MONUMENT FOR HIMSELF AND TURNED AND PASSED ON AND WENT DOWN TO GILGAL

 AND SAMUEL CAME TO SAUL AND SAUL SAID TO HIM BLESSED BE YOU TO THE LORD

I HAVE PERFORMED THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD

 AND SAMUEL SAID WHAT THEN IS THIS BLEATING OF THE SHEEP IN MY EARS AND THE LOWING OF THE OXEN THAT I HEAR

 SAUL SAID THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEM FROM THE AMALEKITES FOR THE PEOPLE SPARED THE BEST OF THE SHEEP AND OF THE OXEN TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD YOUR GOD AND THE REST WE HAVE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION

 THEN SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL STOP

I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE LORD SAID TO ME THIS NIGHT

 AND HE SAID TO HIM SPEAK

 AND SAMUEL SAID THOUGH YOU ARE LITTLE IN YOUR OWN EYES ARE YOU NOT THE HEAD OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

THE LORD ANOINTED YOU KING OVER ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SENT YOU ON A MISSION AND SAID 'GO DEVOTE TO DESTRUCTION THE SINNERS THE AMALEKITES AND FIGHT AGAINST THEM UNTIL THEY ARE CONSUMED

' WHY THEN DID YOU NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD

WHY DID YOU POUNCE ON THE SPOIL AND DO WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

 AND SAUL SAID TO SAMUEL I HAVE OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD

I HAVE GONE ON THE MISSION ON WHICH THE LORD SENT ME

I HAVE BROUGHT AGAG THE KING OF AMALEK AND I HAVE DEVOTED THE AMALEKITES TO DESTRUCTION

BUT THE PEOPLE TOOK OF THE SPOIL SHEEP AND OXEN THE BEST OF THE THINGS DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD YOUR GOD IN GILGAL

 AND SAMUEL SAID HAS THE LORD AS GREAT DELIGHT IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES AS IN OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE LORD

BEHOLD TO OBEY IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE AND TO LISTEN THAN THE FAT OF RAMS

FOR REBELLION IS AS THE SIN OF DIVINATION AND PRESUMPTION IS AS INIQUITY AND IDOLATRY

BECAUSE YOU HAVE REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD HE HAS ALSO REJECTED YOU FROM BEING KING

 SAUL SAID TO SAMUEL I HAVE SINNED FOR I HAVE TRANSGRESSED THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD AND YOUR WORDS BECAUSE I FEARED THE PEOPLE AND OBEYED THEIR VOICE

NOW THEREFORE PLEASE PARDON MY SIN AND RETURN WITH ME THAT I MAY WORSHIP THE LORD

 AND SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL I WILL NOT RETURN WITH YOU

FOR YOU HAVE REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD AND THE LORD HAS REJECTED YOU FROM BEING KING OVER ISRAEL

 AS SAMUEL TURNED TO GO AWAY SAUL SEIZED THE SKIRT OF HIS ROBE AND IT TORE

AND SAMUEL SAID TO HIM THE LORD HAS TORN THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL FROM YOU THIS DAY AND HAS GIVEN IT TO A NEIGHBOR OF YOURS WHO IS BETTER THAN YOU

AND ALSO THE GLORY OF ISRAEL WILL NOT LIE OR HAVE REGRET FOR HE IS NOT A MAN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REGRET

 THEN HE SAID I HAVE SINNED; YET HONOR ME NOW BEFORE THE ELDERS OF MY PEOPLE AND BEFORE ISRAEL AND RETURN WITH ME THAT I MAY BOW BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD

 SO SAMUEL TURNED BACK AFTER SAUL AND SAUL BOWED BEFORE THE LORD

THEN SAMUEL SAID BRING HERE TO ME AGAG THE KING OF THE AMALEKITES

 AND AGAG CAME TO HIM CHEERFULLY

AGAG SAID SURELY THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH IS PAST

 AND SAMUEL SAID AS YOUR SWORD HAS MADE WOMEN CHILDLESS SO SHALL YOUR MOTHER BE CHILDLESS AMONG WOMEN

 AND SAMUEL HACKED AGAG TO PIECES BEFORE THE LORD IN GILGAL

THEN SAMUEL WENT TO RAMAH AND SAUL WENT UP TO HIS HOUSE IN GIBEAH OF SAUL

AND SAMUEL DID NOT SEE SAUL AGAIN UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH BUT SAMUEL GRIEVED OVER SAUL

AND THE LORD REGRETTED THAT HE HAD MADE SAUL KING OVER ISRAEL

THE LORD SAID TO SAMUEL HOW LONG WILL YOU GRIEVE OVER SAUL SINCE I HAVE REJECTED HIM FROM BEING KING OVER ISRAEL

FILL YOUR HORN WITH OIL AND GO

I WILL SEND YOU TO JESSE THE BETHLEHEMITE FOR I HAVE PROVIDED FOR MYSELF A KING AMONG HIS SONS

 AND SAMUEL SAID HOW CAN I GO

IF SAUL HEARS IT HE WILL KILL ME

 AND THE LORD SAID TAKE A HEIFER WITH YOU AND SAY 'I HAVE COME TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD

' AND INVITE JESSE TO THE SACRIFICE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU SHALL DO

AND YOU SHALL ANOINT FOR ME HIM WHOM I DECLARE TO YOU

 SAMUEL DID WHAT THE LORD COMMANDED AND CAME TO BETHLEHEM

THE ELDERS OF THE CITY CAME TO MEET HIM TREMBLING AND SAID DO YOU COME PEACEABLY

 AND HE SAID PEACEABLY; I HAVE COME TO SACRIFICE TO THE LORD

CONSECRATE YOURSELVES AND COME WITH ME TO THE SACRIFICE

 AND HE CONSECRATED JESSE AND HIS SONS AND INVITED THEM TO THE SACRIFICE

WHEN THEY CAME HE LOOKED ON ELIAB AND THOUGHT SURELY THE LORD'S ANOINTED IS BEFORE HIM

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO SAMUEL DO NOT LOOK ON HIS APPEARANCE OR ON THE HEIGHT OF HIS STATURE BECAUSE I HAVE REJECTED HIM

FOR THE LORD SEES NOT AS MAN SEES MAN LOOKS ON THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE BUT THE LORD LOOKS ON THE HEART

 THEN JESSE CALLED ABINADAB AND MADE HIM PASS BEFORE SAMUEL

AND HE SAID NEITHER HAS THE LORD CHOSEN THIS ONE

 THEN JESSE MADE SHAMMAH PASS BY

AND HE SAID NEITHER HAS THE LORD CHOSEN THIS ONE

 AND JESSE MADE SEVEN OF HIS SONS PASS BEFORE SAMUEL

AND SAMUEL SAID TO JESSE THE LORD HAS NOT CHOSEN THESE

 THEN SAMUEL SAID TO JESSE ARE ALL YOUR SONS HERE

 AND HE SAID THERE REMAINS YET THE YOUNGEST BUT BEHOLD HE IS KEEPING THE SHEEP

 AND SAMUEL SAID TO JESSE SEND AND GET HIM FOR WE WILL NOT SIT DOWN TILL HE COMES HERE

 AND HE SENT AND BROUGHT HIM IN

NOW HE WAS RUDDY AND HAD BEAUTIFUL EYES AND WAS HANDSOME

AND THE LORD SAID ARISE ANOINT HIM FOR THIS IS HE

 THEN SAMUEL TOOK THE HORN OF OIL AND ANOINTED HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS BROTHERS

AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RUSHED UPON DAVID FROM THAT DAY FORWARD

AND SAMUEL ROSE UP AND WENT TO RAMAH

NOW THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD DEPARTED FROM SAUL AND AN EVIL SPIRIT FROM THE LORD TORMENTED HIM

AND SAUL'S SERVANTS SAID TO HIM BEHOLD NOW AN EVIL SPIRIT FROM GOD IS TORMENTING YOU

LET OUR LORD NOW COMMAND YOUR SERVANTS WHO ARE BEFORE YOU TO SEEK OUT A MAN WHO IS SKILLFUL IN PLAYING THE LYRE AND WHEN THE EVIL SPIRIT FROM GOD IS UPON YOU HE WILL PLAY IT AND YOU WILL BE WELL

 SO SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANTS PROVIDE FOR ME A MAN WHO CAN PLAY WELL AND BRING HIM TO ME

 ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN ANSWERED BEHOLD I HAVE SEEN A SON OF JESSE THE BETHLEHEMITE WHO IS SKILLFUL IN PLAYING A MAN OF VALOR A MAN OF WAR PRUDENT IN SPEECH AND A MAN OF GOOD PRESENCE AND THE LORD IS WITH HIM

 THEREFORE SAUL SENT MESSENGERS TO JESSE AND SAID SEND ME DAVID YOUR SON WHO IS WITH THE SHEEP

 AND JESSE TOOK A DONKEY LADEN WITH BREAD AND A SKIN OF WINE AND A YOUNG GOAT AND SENT THEM BY DAVID HIS SON TO SAUL

AND DAVID CAME TO SAUL AND ENTERED HIS SERVICE

AND SAUL LOVED HIM GREATLY AND HE BECAME HIS ARMORBEARER

AND SAUL SENT TO JESSE SAYING LET DAVID REMAIN IN MY SERVICE FOR HE HAS FOUND FAVOR IN MY SIGHT

 AND WHENEVER THE EVIL SPIRIT FROM GOD WAS UPON SAUL DAVID TOOK THE LYRE AND PLAYED IT WITH HIS HAND

SO SAUL WAS REFRESHED AND WAS WELL AND THE EVIL SPIRIT DEPARTED FROM HIM

NOW THE PHILISTINES GATHERED THEIR ARMIES FOR BATTLE

AND THEY WERE GATHERED AT SOCOH WHICH BELONGS TO JUDAH AND ENCAMPED BETWEEN SOCOH AND AZEKAH IN EPHESDAMMIM

AND SAUL AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE GATHERED AND ENCAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH AND DREW UP IN LINE OF BATTLE AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

AND THE PHILISTINES STOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN ON THE ONE SIDE AND ISRAEL STOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A VALLEY BETWEEN THEM

AND THERE CAME OUT FROM THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES A CHAMPION NAMED GOLIATH OF GATH WHOSE HEIGHT WAS SIX CUBITS AND A SPAN

HE HAD A HELMET OF BRONZE ON HIS HEAD AND HE WAS ARMED WITH A COAT OF MAIL AND THE WEIGHT OF THE COAT WAS FIVE THOUSAND SHEKELS OF BRONZE

AND HE HAD BRONZE ARMOR ON HIS LEGS AND A JAVELIN OF BRONZE SLUNG BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS

THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR WAS LIKE A WEAVER'S BEAM AND HIS SPEAR'S HEAD WEIGHED SIX HUNDRED SHEKELS OF IRON

AND HIS SHIELDBEARER WENT BEFORE HIM

HE STOOD AND SHOUTED TO THE RANKS OF ISRAEL WHY HAVE YOU COME OUT TO DRAW UP FOR BATTLE

AM I NOT A PHILISTINE AND ARE YOU NOT SERVANTS OF SAUL

CHOOSE A MAN FOR YOURSELVES AND LET HIM COME DOWN TO ME

IF HE IS ABLE TO FIGHT WITH ME AND KILL ME THEN WE WILL BE YOUR SERVANTS

BUT IF I PREVAIL AGAINST HIM AND KILL HIM THEN YOU SHALL BE OUR SERVANTS AND SERVE US

 AND THE PHILISTINE SAID I DEFY THE RANKS OF ISRAEL THIS DAY

GIVE ME A MAN THAT WE MAY FIGHT TOGETHER

 WHEN SAUL AND ALL ISRAEL HEARD THESE WORDS OF THE PHILISTINE THEY WERE DISMAYED AND GREATLY AFRAID

NOW DAVID WAS THE SON OF AN EPHRATHITE OF BETHLEHEM IN JUDAH NAMED JESSE WHO HAD EIGHT SONS

IN THE DAYS OF SAUL THE MAN WAS ALREADY OLD AND ADVANCED IN YEARS

THE THREE OLDEST SONS OF JESSE HAD FOLLOWED SAUL TO THE BATTLE

AND THE NAMES OF HIS THREE SONS WHO WENT TO THE BATTLE WERE ELIAB THE FIRSTBORN AND NEXT TO HIM ABINADAB AND THE THIRD SHAMMAH

DAVID WAS THE YOUNGEST

THE THREE ELDEST FOLLOWED SAUL BUT DAVID WENT BACK AND FORTH FROM SAUL TO FEED HIS FATHER'S SHEEP AT BETHLEHEM

FOR FORTY DAYS THE PHILISTINE CAME FORWARD AND TOOK HIS STAND MORNING AND EVENING

AND JESSE SAID TO DAVID HIS SON TAKE FOR YOUR BROTHERS AN EPHAH OF THIS PARCHED GRAIN AND THESE TEN LOAVES AND CARRY THEM QUICKLY TO THE CAMP TO YOUR BROTHERS

ALSO TAKE THESE TEN CHEESES TO THE COMMANDER OF THEIR THOUSAND

SEE IF YOUR BROTHERS ARE WELL AND BRING SOME TOKEN FROM THEM

 NOW SAUL AND THEY AND ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL WERE IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH FIGHTING WITH THE PHILISTINES

AND DAVID ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND LEFT THE SHEEP WITH A KEEPER AND TOOK THE PROVISIONS AND WENT AS JESSE HAD COMMANDED HIM

AND HE CAME TO THE ENCAMPMENT AS THE HOST WAS GOING OUT TO THE BATTLE LINE SHOUTING THE WAR CRY

AND ISRAEL AND THE PHILISTINES DREW UP FOR BATTLE ARMY AGAINST ARMY

AND DAVID LEFT THE THINGS IN CHARGE OF THE KEEPER OF THE BAGGAGE AND RAN TO THE RANKS AND WENT AND GREETED HIS BROTHERS

AS HE TALKED WITH THEM BEHOLD THE CHAMPION THE PHILISTINE OF GATH GOLIATH BY NAME CAME UP OUT OF THE RANKS OF THE PHILISTINES AND SPOKE THE SAME WORDS AS BEFORE

AND DAVID HEARD HIM

ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY SAW THE MAN FLED FROM HIM AND WERE MUCH AFRAID

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAID HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN WHO HAS COME UP

SURELY HE HAS COME UP TO DEFY ISRAEL

AND THE KING WILL ENRICH THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM WITH GREAT RICHES AND WILL GIVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER AND MAKE HIS FATHER'S HOUSE FREE IN ISRAEL

 AND DAVID SAID TO THE MEN WHO STOOD BY HIM WHAT SHALL BE DONE FOR THE MAN WHO KILLS THIS PHILISTINE AND TAKES AWAY THE REPROACH FROM ISRAEL

FOR WHO IS THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE THAT HE SHOULD DEFY THE ARMIES OF THE LIVING GOD

 AND THE PEOPLE ANSWERED HIM IN THE SAME WAY SO SHALL IT BE DONE TO THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM

 NOW ELIAB HIS ELDEST BROTHER HEARD WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE MEN

AND ELIAB'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST DAVID AND HE SAID WHY HAVE YOU COME DOWN

AND WITH WHOM HAVE YOU LEFT THOSE FEW SHEEP IN THE WILDERNESS

I KNOW YOUR PRESUMPTION AND THE EVIL OF YOUR HEART FOR YOU HAVE COME DOWN TO SEE THE BATTLE

 AND DAVID SAID WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW

WAS IT NOT BUT A WORD

 AND HE TURNED AWAY FROM HIM TOWARD ANOTHER AND SPOKE IN THE SAME WAY AND THE PEOPLE ANSWERED HIM AGAIN AS BEFORE

WHEN THE WORDS THAT DAVID SPOKE WERE HEARD THEY REPEATED THEM BEFORE SAUL AND HE SENT FOR HIM

AND DAVID SAID TO SAUL LET NO MAN'S HEART FAIL BECAUSE OF HIM

YOUR SERVANT WILL GO AND FIGHT WITH THIS PHILISTINE

 AND SAUL SAID TO DAVID YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GO AGAINST THIS PHILISTINE TO FIGHT WITH HIM FOR YOU ARE BUT A YOUTH AND HE HAS BEEN A MAN OF WAR FROM HIS YOUTH

 BUT DAVID SAID TO SAUL YOUR SERVANT USED TO KEEP SHEEP FOR HIS FATHER

AND WHEN THERE CAME A LION OR A BEAR AND TOOK A LAMB FROM THE FLOCK I WENT AFTER HIM AND STRUCK HIM AND DELIVERED IT OUT OF HIS MOUTH

AND IF HE AROSE AGAINST ME I CAUGHT HIM BY HIS BEARD AND STRUCK HIM AND KILLED HIM

YOUR SERVANT HAS STRUCK DOWN BOTH LIONS AND BEARS AND THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE SHALL BE LIKE ONE OF THEM FOR HE HAS DEFIED THE ARMIES OF THE LIVING GOD

 AND DAVID SAID THE LORD WHO DELIVERED ME FROM THE PAW OF THE LION AND FROM THE PAW OF THE BEAR WILL DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF THIS PHILISTINE

 AND SAUL SAID TO DAVID GO AND THE LORD BE WITH YOU

 THEN SAUL CLOTHED DAVID WITH HIS ARMOR

HE PUT A HELMET OF BRONZE ON HIS HEAD AND CLOTHED HIM WITH A COAT OF MAIL AND DAVID STRAPPED HIS SWORD OVER HIS ARMOR

AND HE TRIED IN VAIN TO GO FOR HE HAD NOT TESTED THEM

THEN DAVID SAID TO SAUL I CANNOT GO WITH THESE FOR I HAVE NOT TESTED THEM

 SO DAVID PUT THEM OFF

THEN HE TOOK HIS STAFF IN HIS HAND AND CHOSE FIVE SMOOTH STONES FROM THE BROOK AND PUT THEM IN HIS SHEPHERD'S POUCH

HIS SLING WAS IN HIS HAND AND HE APPROACHED THE PHILISTINE

AND THE PHILISTINE MOVED FORWARD AND CAME NEAR TO DAVID WITH HIS SHIELDBEARER IN FRONT OF HIM

AND WHEN THE PHILISTINE LOOKED AND SAW DAVID HE DISDAINED HIM FOR HE WAS BUT A YOUTH RUDDY AND HANDSOME IN APPEARANCE

AND THE PHILISTINE SAID TO DAVID AM I A DOG THAT YOU COME TO ME WITH STICKS

 AND THE PHILISTINE CURSED DAVID BY HIS GODS

THE PHILISTINE SAID TO DAVID COME TO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOUR FLESH TO THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND TO THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD

 THEN DAVID SAID TO THE PHILISTINE YOU COME TO ME WITH A SWORD AND WITH A SPEAR AND WITH A JAVELIN BUT I COME TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF THE ARMIES OF ISRAEL WHOM YOU HAVE DEFIED

THIS DAY THE LORD WILL DELIVER YOU INTO MY HAND AND I WILL STRIKE YOU DOWN AND CUT OFF YOUR HEAD

AND I WILL GIVE THE DEAD BODIES OF THE HOST OF THE PHILISTINES THIS DAY TO THE BIRDS OF THE AIR AND TO THE WILD BEASTS OF THE EARTH THAT ALL THE EARTH MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD IN ISRAEL AND THAT ALL THIS ASSEMBLY MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD SAVES NOT WITH SWORD AND SPEAR

FOR THE BATTLE IS THE LORD'S AND HE WILL GIVE YOU INTO OUR HAND

 WHEN THE PHILISTINE AROSE AND CAME AND DREW NEAR TO MEET DAVID DAVID RAN QUICKLY TOWARD THE BATTLE LINE TO MEET THE PHILISTINE

AND DAVID PUT HIS HAND IN HIS BAG AND TOOK OUT A STONE AND SLUNG IT AND STRUCK THE PHILISTINE ON HIS FOREHEAD

THE STONE SANK INTO HIS FOREHEAD AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE TO THE GROUND

SO DAVID PREVAILED OVER THE PHILISTINE WITH A SLING AND WITH A STONE AND STRUCK THE PHILISTINE AND KILLED HIM

THERE WAS NO SWORD IN THE HAND OF DAVID

THEN DAVID RAN AND STOOD OVER THE PHILISTINE AND TOOK HIS SWORD AND DREW IT OUT OF ITS SHEATH AND KILLED HIM AND CUT OFF HIS HEAD WITH IT

WHEN THE PHILISTINES SAW THAT THEIR CHAMPION WAS DEAD THEY FLED

AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH ROSE WITH A SHOUT AND PURSUED THE PHILISTINES AS FAR AS GATH AND THE GATES OF EKRON SO THAT THE WOUNDED PHILISTINES FELL ON THE WAY FROM SHAARAIM AS FAR AS GATH AND EKRON

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME BACK FROM CHASING THE PHILISTINES AND THEY PLUNDERED THEIR CAMP

AND DAVID TOOK THE HEAD OF THE PHILISTINE AND BROUGHT IT TO JERUSALEM BUT HE PUT HIS ARMOR IN HIS TENT

AS SOON AS SAUL SAW DAVID GO OUT AGAINST THE PHILISTINE HE SAID TO ABNER THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY ABNER WHOSE SON IS THIS YOUTH

 AND ABNER SAID AS YOUR SOUL LIVES O KING I DO NOT KNOW

 AND THE KING SAID INQUIRE WHOSE SON THE BOY IS

 AND AS SOON AS DAVID RETURNED FROM THE STRIKING DOWN OF THE PHILISTINE ABNER TOOK HIM AND BROUGHT HIM BEFORE SAUL WITH THE HEAD OF THE PHILISTINE IN HIS HAND

AND SAUL SAID TO HIM WHOSE SON ARE YOU YOUNG MAN

 AND DAVID ANSWERED I AM THE SON OF YOUR SERVANT JESSE THE BETHLEHEMITE

AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING TO SAUL THE SOUL OF JONATHAN WAS KNIT TO THE SOUL OF DAVID AND JONATHAN LOVED HIM AS HIS OWN SOUL

AND SAUL TOOK HIM THAT DAY AND WOULD NOT LET HIM RETURN TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

THEN JONATHAN MADE A COVENANT WITH DAVID BECAUSE HE LOVED HIM AS HIS OWN SOUL

AND JONATHAN STRIPPED HIMSELF OF THE ROBE THAT WAS ON HIM AND GAVE IT TO DAVID AND HIS ARMOR AND EVEN HIS SWORD AND HIS BOW AND HIS BELT

AND DAVID WENT OUT AND WAS SUCCESSFUL WHEREVER SAUL SENT HIM SO THAT SAUL SET HIM OVER THE MEN OF WAR

AND THIS WAS GOOD IN THE SIGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE AND ALSO IN THE SIGHT OF SAUL'S SERVANTS

AS THEY WERE COMING HOME WHEN DAVID RETURNED FROM STRIKING DOWN THE PHILISTINE THE WOMEN CAME OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF ISRAEL SINGING AND DANCING TO MEET KING SAUL WITH TAMBOURINES WITH SONGS OF JOY AND WITH MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS

AND THE WOMEN SANG TO ONE ANOTHER AS THEY CELEBRATED SAUL HAS STRUCK DOWN HIS THOUSANDS AND DAVID HIS TEN THOUSANDS

 AND SAUL WAS VERY ANGRY AND THIS SAYING DISPLEASED HIM

HE SAID THEY HAVE ASCRIBED TO DAVID TEN THOUSANDS AND TO ME THEY HAVE ASCRIBED THOUSANDS AND WHAT MORE CAN HE HAVE BUT THE KINGDOM

 AND SAUL EYED DAVID FROM THAT DAY ON

THE NEXT DAY A HARMFUL SPIRIT FROM GOD RUSHED UPON SAUL AND HE RAVED WITHIN HIS HOUSE WHILE DAVID WAS PLAYING THE LYRE AS HE DID DAY BY DAY

SAUL HAD HIS SPEAR IN HIS HAND

AND SAUL HURLED THE SPEAR FOR HE THOUGHT I WILL PIN DAVID TO THE WALL

 BUT DAVID EVADED HIM TWICE

SAUL WAS AFRAID OF DAVID BECAUSE THE LORD WAS WITH HIM BUT HAD DEPARTED FROM SAUL

SO SAUL REMOVED HIM FROM HIS PRESENCE AND MADE HIM A COMMANDER OF A THOUSAND

AND HE WENT OUT AND CAME IN BEFORE THE PEOPLE

AND DAVID HAD SUCCESS IN ALL HIS UNDERTAKINGS FOR THE LORD WAS WITH HIM

AND WHEN SAUL SAW THAT HE HAD GREAT SUCCESS HE STOOD IN FEARFUL AWE OF HIM

BUT ALL ISRAEL AND JUDAH LOVED DAVID FOR HE WENT OUT AND CAME IN BEFORE THEM

THEN SAUL SAID TO DAVID HERE IS MY ELDER DAUGHTER MERAB

I WILL GIVE HER TO YOU FOR A WIFE

ONLY BE VALIANT FOR ME AND FIGHT THE LORD'S BATTLES

 FOR SAUL THOUGHT LET NOT MY HAND BE AGAINST HIM BUT LET THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES BE AGAINST HIM

 AND DAVID SAID TO SAUL WHO AM I AND WHO ARE MY RELATIVES MY FATHER'S CLAN IN ISRAEL THAT I SHOULD BE SONINLAW TO THE KING

 BUT AT THE TIME WHEN MERAB SAUL'S DAUGHTER SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO DAVID SHE WAS GIVEN TO ADRIEL THE MEHOLATHITE FOR A WIFE

NOW SAUL'S DAUGHTER MICHAL LOVED DAVID

AND THEY TOLD SAUL AND THE THING PLEASED HIM

SAUL THOUGHT LET ME GIVE HER TO HIM THAT SHE MAY BE A SNARE FOR HIM AND THAT THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES MAY BE AGAINST HIM

 THEREFORE SAUL SAID TO DAVID A SECOND TIME YOU SHALL NOW BE MY SONINLAW

 AND SAUL COMMANDED HIS SERVANTS SPEAK TO DAVID IN PRIVATE AND SAY 'BEHOLD THE KING HAS DELIGHT IN YOU AND ALL HIS SERVANTS LOVE YOU

NOW THEN BECOME THE KING'S SONINLAW

' AND SAUL'S SERVANTS SPOKE THOSE WORDS IN THE EARS OF DAVID

AND DAVID SAID DOES IT SEEM TO YOU A LITTLE THING TO BECOME THE KING'S SONINLAW SINCE I AM A POOR MAN AND HAVE NO REPUTATION

 AND THE SERVANTS OF SAUL TOLD HIM THUS AND SO DID DAVID SPEAK

 THEN SAUL SAID THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO DAVID 'THE KING DESIRES NO BRIDEPRICE EXCEPT A HUNDRED FORESKINS OF THE PHILISTINES THAT HE MAY BE AVENGED OF THE KING'S ENEMIES

' NOW SAUL THOUGHT TO MAKE DAVID FALL BY THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

AND WHEN HIS SERVANTS TOLD DAVID THESE WORDS IT PLEASED DAVID WELL TO BE THE KING'S SONINLAW

BEFORE THE TIME HAD EXPIRED DAVID AROSE AND WENT ALONG WITH HIS MEN AND KILLED TWO HUNDRED OF THE PHILISTINES

AND DAVID BROUGHT THEIR FORESKINS WHICH WERE GIVEN IN FULL NUMBER TO THE KING THAT HE MIGHT BECOME THE KING'S SONINLAW

AND SAUL GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER MICHAL FOR A WIFE

BUT WHEN SAUL SAW AND KNEW THAT THE LORD WAS WITH DAVID AND THAT MICHAL SAUL'S DAUGHTER LOVED HIM SAUL WAS EVEN MORE AFRAID OF DAVID

SO SAUL WAS DAVID'S ENEMY CONTINUALLY

THEN THE PRINCES OF THE PHILISTINES CAME OUT TO BATTLE AND AS OFTEN AS THEY CAME OUT DAVID HAD MORE SUCCESS THAN ALL THE SERVANTS OF SAUL SO THAT HIS NAME WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED

AND SAUL SPOKE TO JONATHAN HIS SON AND TO ALL HIS SERVANTS THAT THEY SHOULD KILL DAVID

BUT JONATHAN SAUL'S SON DELIGHTED MUCH IN DAVID

AND JONATHAN TOLD DAVID SAUL MY FATHER SEEKS TO KILL YOU

THEREFORE BE ON YOUR GUARD IN THE MORNING

STAY IN A SECRET PLACE AND HIDE YOURSELF

AND I WILL GO OUT AND STAND BESIDE MY FATHER IN THE FIELD WHERE YOU ARE AND I WILL SPEAK TO MY FATHER ABOUT YOU

AND IF I LEARN ANYTHING I WILL TELL YOU

 AND JONATHAN SPOKE WELL OF DAVID TO SAUL HIS FATHER AND SAID TO HIM LET NOT THE KING SIN AGAINST HIS SERVANT DAVID BECAUSE HE HAS NOT SINNED AGAINST YOU AND BECAUSE HIS DEEDS HAVE BROUGHT GOOD TO YOU

FOR HE TOOK HIS LIFE IN HIS HAND AND HE STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINE AND THE LORD WORKED A GREAT SALVATION FOR ALL ISRAEL

YOU SAW IT AND REJOICED

WHY THEN WILL YOU SIN AGAINST INNOCENT BLOOD BY KILLING DAVID WITHOUT CAUSE

 AND SAUL LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF JONATHAN

SAUL SWORE AS THE LORD LIVES HE SHALL NOT BE PUT TO DEATH

 AND JONATHAN CALLED DAVID AND JONATHAN REPORTED TO HIM ALL THESE THINGS

AND JONATHAN BROUGHT DAVID TO SAUL AND HE WAS IN HIS PRESENCE AS BEFORE

AND THERE WAS WAR AGAIN

AND DAVID WENT OUT AND FOUGHT WITH THE PHILISTINES AND STRUCK THEM WITH A GREAT BLOW SO THAT THEY FLED BEFORE HIM

THEN A HARMFUL SPIRIT FROM THE LORD CAME UPON SAUL AS HE SAT IN HIS HOUSE WITH HIS SPEAR IN HIS HAND

AND DAVID WAS PLAYING THE LYRE

AND SAUL SOUGHT TO PIN DAVID TO THE WALL WITH THE SPEAR BUT HE ELUDED SAUL SO THAT HE STRUCK THE SPEAR INTO THE WALL

AND DAVID FLED AND ESCAPED THAT NIGHT

SAUL SENT MESSENGERS TO DAVID'S HOUSE TO WATCH HIM THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIM IN THE MORNING

BUT MICHAL DAVID'S WIFE TOLD HIM IF YOU DO NOT ESCAPE WITH YOUR LIFE TONIGHT TOMORROW YOU WILL BE KILLED

 SO MICHAL LET DAVID DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HE FLED AWAY AND ESCAPED

MICHAL TOOK AN IMAGE AND LAID IT ON THE BED AND PUT A PILLOW OF GOATS' HAIR AT ITS HEAD AND COVERED IT WITH THE CLOTHES

AND WHEN SAUL SENT MESSENGERS TO TAKE DAVID SHE SAID HE IS SICK

 THEN SAUL SENT THE MESSENGERS TO SEE DAVID SAYING BRING HIM UP TO ME IN THE BED THAT I MAY KILL HIM

 AND WHEN THE MESSENGERS CAME IN BEHOLD THE IMAGE WAS IN THE BED WITH THE PILLOW OF GOATS' HAIR AT ITS HEAD

SAUL SAID TO MICHAL WHY HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME THUS AND LET MY ENEMY GO SO THAT HE HAS ESCAPED

 AND MICHAL ANSWERED SAUL HE SAID TO ME 'LET ME GO

WHY SHOULD I KILL YOU

' NOW DAVID FLED AND ESCAPED AND HE CAME TO SAMUEL AT RAMAH AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT SAUL HAD DONE TO HIM

AND HE AND SAMUEL WENT AND LIVED AT NAIOTH

AND IT WAS TOLD SAUL BEHOLD DAVID IS AT NAIOTH IN RAMAH

 THEN SAUL SENT MESSENGERS TO TAKE DAVID AND WHEN THEY SAW THE COMPANY OF THE PROPHETS PROPHESYING AND SAMUEL STANDING AS HEAD OVER THEM THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME UPON THE MESSENGERS OF SAUL AND THEY ALSO PROPHESIED

WHEN IT WAS TOLD SAUL HE SENT OTHER MESSENGERS AND THEY ALSO PROPHESIED

AND SAUL SENT MESSENGERS AGAIN THE THIRD TIME AND THEY ALSO PROPHESIED

THEN HE HIMSELF WENT TO RAMAH AND CAME TO THE GREAT WELL THAT IS IN SECU

AND HE ASKED WHERE ARE SAMUEL AND DAVID

 AND ONE SAID BEHOLD THEY ARE AT NAIOTH IN RAMAH

 AND HE WENT THERE TO NAIOTH IN RAMAH

AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME UPON HIM ALSO AND AS HE WENT HE PROPHESIED UNTIL HE CAME TO NAIOTH IN RAMAH

AND HE TOO STRIPPED OFF HIS CLOTHES AND HE TOO PROPHESIED BEFORE SAMUEL AND LAY NAKED ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT

THUS IT IS SAID IS SAUL ALSO AMONG THE PROPHETS

THEN DAVID FLED FROM NAIOTH IN RAMAH AND CAME AND SAID BEFORE JONATHAN WHAT HAVE I DONE

WHAT IS MY GUILT

AND WHAT IS MY SIN BEFORE YOUR FATHER THAT HE SEEKS MY LIFE

 AND HE SAID TO HIM FAR FROM IT

YOU SHALL NOT DIE

BEHOLD MY FATHER DOES NOTHING EITHER GREAT OR SMALL WITHOUT DISCLOSING IT TO ME

AND WHY SHOULD MY FATHER HIDE THIS FROM ME

IT IS NOT SO

 BUT DAVID VOWED AGAIN SAYING YOUR FATHER KNOWS WELL THAT I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES AND HE THINKS 'DO NOT LET JONATHAN KNOW THIS LEST HE BE GRIEVED

' BUT TRULY AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOUR SOUL LIVES THERE IS BUT A STEP BETWEEN ME AND DEATH

 THEN JONATHAN SAID TO DAVID WHATEVER YOU SAY I WILL DO FOR YOU

 DAVID SAID TO JONATHAN BEHOLD TOMORROW IS THE NEW MOON AND I SHOULD NOT FAIL TO SIT AT TABLE WITH THE KING

BUT LET ME GO THAT I MAY HIDE MYSELF IN THE FIELD TILL THE THIRD DAY AT EVENING

IF YOUR FATHER MISSES ME AT ALL THEN SAY 'DAVID EARNESTLY ASKED LEAVE OF ME TO RUN TO BETHLEHEM HIS CITY FOR THERE IS A YEARLY SACRIFICE THERE FOR ALL THE CLAN

' IF HE SAYS 'GOOD

' IT WILL BE WELL WITH YOUR SERVANT BUT IF HE IS ANGRY THEN KNOW THAT HARM IS DETERMINED BY HIM

THEREFORE DEAL KINDLY WITH YOUR SERVANT FOR YOU HAVE BROUGHT YOUR SERVANT INTO A COVENANT OF THE LORD WITH YOU

BUT IF THERE IS GUILT IN ME KILL ME YOURSELF FOR WHY SHOULD YOU BRING ME TO YOUR FATHER

 AND JONATHAN SAID FAR BE IT FROM YOU

IF I KNEW THAT IT WAS DETERMINED BY MY FATHER THAT HARM SHOULD COME TO YOU WOULD I NOT TELL YOU

 THEN DAVID SAID TO JONATHAN WHO WILL TELL ME IF YOUR FATHER ANSWERS YOU ROUGHLY

 AND JONATHAN SAID TO DAVID COME LET US GO OUT INTO THE FIELD

 SO THEY BOTH WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD

AND JONATHAN SAID TO DAVID THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BE WITNESS

WHEN I HAVE SOUNDED OUT MY FATHER ABOUT THIS TIME TOMORROW OR THE THIRD DAY BEHOLD IF HE IS WELL DISPOSED TOWARD DAVID SHALL I NOT THEN SEND AND DISCLOSE IT TO YOU

BUT SHOULD IT PLEASE MY FATHER TO DO YOU HARM THE LORD DO SO TO JONATHAN AND MORE ALSO IF I DO NOT DISCLOSE IT TO YOU AND SEND YOU AWAY THAT YOU MAY GO IN SAFETY

MAY THE LORD BE WITH YOU AS HE HAS BEEN WITH MY FATHER

IF I AM STILL ALIVE SHOW ME THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD THAT I MAY NOT DIE; AND DO NOT CUT OFF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE FROM MY HOUSE FOREVER WHEN THE LORD CUTS OFF EVERY ONE OF THE ENEMIES OF DAVID FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH

 AND JONATHAN MADE A COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF DAVID SAYING MAY THE LORD TAKE VENGEANCE ON DAVID'S ENEMIES

 AND JONATHAN MADE DAVID SWEAR AGAIN BY HIS LOVE FOR HIM FOR HE LOVED HIM AS HE LOVED HIS OWN SOUL

THEN JONATHAN SAID TO HIM TOMORROW IS THE NEW MOON AND YOU WILL BE MISSED BECAUSE YOUR SEAT WILL BE EMPTY

ON THE THIRD DAY GO DOWN QUICKLY TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU HID YOURSELF WHEN THE MATTER WAS IN HAND AND REMAIN BESIDE THE STONE HEAP

AND I WILL SHOOT THREE ARROWS TO THE SIDE OF IT AS THOUGH I SHOT AT A MARK

AND BEHOLD I WILL SEND THE YOUNG MAN SAYING 'GO FIND THE ARROWS

' IF I SAY TO THE YOUNG MAN 'LOOK THE ARROWS ARE ON THIS SIDE OF YOU TAKE THEM' THEN YOU ARE TO COME FOR AS THE LORD LIVES IT IS SAFE FOR YOU AND THERE IS NO DANGER

BUT IF I SAY TO THE YOUTH 'LOOK THE ARROWS ARE BEYOND YOU' THEN GO FOR THE LORD HAS SENT YOU AWAY

AND AS FOR THE MATTER OF WHICH YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN BEHOLD THE LORD IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME FOREVER

 SO DAVID HID HIMSELF IN THE FIELD

AND WHEN THE NEW MOON CAME THE KING SAT DOWN TO EAT FOOD

THE KING SAT ON HIS SEAT AS AT OTHER TIMES ON THE SEAT BY THE WALL

JONATHAN SAT OPPOSITE AND ABNER SAT BY SAUL'S SIDE BUT DAVID'S PLACE WAS EMPTY

YET SAUL DID NOT SAY ANYTHING THAT DAY FOR HE THOUGHT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM

HE IS NOT CLEAN; SURELY HE IS NOT CLEAN

 BUT ON THE SECOND DAY THE DAY AFTER THE NEW MOON DAVID'S PLACE WAS EMPTY

AND SAUL SAID TO JONATHAN HIS SON WHY HAS NOT THE SON OF JESSE COME TO THE MEAL EITHER YESTERDAY OR TODAY

 JONATHAN ANSWERED SAUL DAVID EARNESTLY ASKED LEAVE OF ME TO GO TO BETHLEHEM

HE SAID 'LET ME GO FOR OUR CLAN HOLDS A SACRIFICE IN THE CITY AND MY BROTHER HAS COMMANDED ME TO BE THERE

SO NOW IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES LET ME GET AWAY AND SEE MY BROTHERS

' FOR THIS REASON HE HAS NOT COME TO THE KING'S TABLE

 THEN SAUL'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST JONATHAN AND HE SAID TO HIM YOU SON OF A PERVERSE REBELLIOUS WOMAN DO I NOT KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE SON OF JESSE TO YOUR OWN SHAME AND TO THE SHAME OF YOUR MOTHER'S NAKEDNESS

FOR AS LONG AS THE SON OF JESSE LIVES ON THE EARTH NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR KINGDOM SHALL BE ESTABLISHED

THEREFORE SEND AND BRING HIM TO ME FOR HE SHALL SURELY DIE

 THEN JONATHAN ANSWERED SAUL HIS FATHER WHY SHOULD HE BE PUT TO DEATH

WHAT HAS HE DONE

 BUT SAUL HURLED HIS SPEAR AT HIM TO STRIKE HIM

SO JONATHAN KNEW THAT HIS FATHER WAS DETERMINED TO PUT DAVID TO DEATH

AND JONATHAN ROSE FROM THE TABLE IN FIERCE ANGER AND ATE NO FOOD THE SECOND DAY OF THE MONTH FOR HE WAS GRIEVED FOR DAVID BECAUSE HIS FATHER HAD DISGRACED HIM

IN THE MORNING JONATHAN WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD TO THE APPOINTMENT WITH DAVID AND WITH HIM A LITTLE BOY

AND HE SAID TO HIS BOY RUN AND FIND THE ARROWS THAT I SHOOT

 AS THE BOY RAN HE SHOT AN ARROW BEYOND HIM

AND WHEN THE BOY CAME TO THE PLACE OF THE ARROW THAT JONATHAN HAD SHOT JONATHAN CALLED AFTER THE BOY AND SAID IS NOT THE ARROW BEYOND YOU

 AND JONATHAN CALLED AFTER THE BOY HURRY

BE QUICK

DO NOT STAY

 SO JONATHAN'S BOY GATHERED UP THE ARROWS AND CAME TO HIS MASTER

BUT THE BOY KNEW NOTHING

ONLY JONATHAN AND DAVID KNEW THE MATTER

AND JONATHAN GAVE HIS WEAPONS TO HIS BOY AND SAID TO HIM GO AND CARRY THEM TO THE CITY

 AND AS SOON AS THE BOY HAD GONE DAVID ROSE FROM BESIDE THE STONE HEAP AND FELL ON HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND BOWED THREE TIMES

AND THEY KISSED ONE ANOTHER AND WEPT WITH ONE ANOTHER DAVID WEEPING THE MOST

THEN JONATHAN SAID TO DAVID GO IN PEACE BECAUSE WE HAVE SWORN BOTH OF US IN THE NAME OF THE LORD SAYING 'THE LORD SHALL BE BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND BETWEEN MY OFFSPRING AND YOUR OFFSPRING FOREVER

' AND HE ROSE AND DEPARTED AND JONATHAN WENT INTO THE CITY

THEN DAVID CAME TO NOB TO AHIMELECH THE PRIEST

AND AHIMELECH CAME TO MEET DAVID TREMBLING AND SAID TO HIM WHY ARE YOU ALONE AND NO ONE WITH YOU

 AND DAVID SAID TO AHIMELECH THE PRIEST THE KING HAS CHARGED ME WITH A MATTER AND SAID TO ME 'LET NO ONE KNOW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER ABOUT WHICH I SEND YOU AND WITH WHICH I HAVE CHARGED YOU

' I HAVE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE YOUNG MEN FOR SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE

NOW THEN WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON HAND

GIVE ME FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD OR WHATEVER IS HERE

 AND THE PRIEST ANSWERED DAVID I HAVE NO COMMON BREAD ON HAND BUT THERE IS HOLY BREADIF THE YOUNG MEN HAVE KEPT THEMSELVES FROM WOMEN

 AND DAVID ANSWERED THE PRIEST TRULY WOMEN HAVE BEEN KEPT FROM US AS ALWAYS WHEN I GO ON AN EXPEDITION

THE VESSELS OF THE YOUNG MEN ARE HOLY EVEN WHEN IT IS AN ORDINARY JOURNEY

HOW MUCH MORE TODAY WILL THEIR VESSELS BE HOLY

 SO THE PRIEST GAVE HIM THE HOLY BREAD FOR THERE WAS NO BREAD THERE BUT THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE WHICH IS REMOVED FROM BEFORE THE LORD TO BE REPLACED BY HOT BREAD ON THE DAY IT IS TAKEN AWAY

NOW A CERTAIN MAN OF THE SERVANTS OF SAUL WAS THERE THAT DAY DETAINED BEFORE THE LORD

HIS NAME WAS DOEG THE EDOMITE THE CHIEF OF SAUL'S HERDSMEN

THEN DAVID SAID TO AHIMELECH THEN HAVE YOU NOT HERE A SPEAR OR A SWORD AT HAND

FOR I HAVE BROUGHT NEITHER MY SWORD NOR MY WEAPONS WITH ME BECAUSE THE KING'S BUSINESS REQUIRED HASTE

 AND THE PRIEST SAID THE SWORD OF GOLIATH THE PHILISTINE WHOM YOU STRUCK DOWN IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH BEHOLD IT IS HERE WRAPPED IN A CLOTH BEHIND THE EPHOD

IF YOU WILL TAKE THAT TAKE IT FOR THERE IS NONE BUT THAT HERE

 AND DAVID SAID THERE IS NONE LIKE THAT; GIVE IT TO ME

 AND DAVID ROSE AND FLED THAT DAY FROM SAUL AND WENT TO ACHISH THE KING OF GATH

AND THE SERVANTS OF ACHISH SAID TO HIM IS NOT THIS DAVID THE KING OF THE LAND

DID THEY NOT SING TO ONE ANOTHER OF HIM IN DANCES 'SAUL HAS STRUCK DOWN HIS THOUSANDS AND DAVID HIS TEN THOUSANDS'

 AND DAVID TOOK THESE WORDS TO HEART AND WAS MUCH AFRAID OF ACHISH THE KING OF GATH

SO HE CHANGED HIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE THEM AND PRETENDED TO BE INSANE IN THEIR HANDS AND MADE MARKS ON THE DOORS OF THE GATE AND LET HIS SPITTLE RUN DOWN HIS BEARD

THEN ACHISH SAID TO HIS SERVANTS BEHOLD YOU SEE THE MAN IS MAD

WHY THEN HAVE YOU BROUGHT HIM TO ME

DO I LACK MADMEN THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS FELLOW TO BEHAVE AS A MADMAN IN MY PRESENCE

SHALL THIS FELLOW COME INTO MY HOUSE

DAVID DEPARTED FROM THERE AND ESCAPED TO THE CAVE OF ADULLAM

AND WHEN HIS BROTHERS AND ALL HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HEARD IT THEY WENT DOWN THERE TO HIM

AND EVERYONE WHO WAS IN DISTRESS AND EVERYONE WHO WAS IN DEBT AND EVERYONE WHO WAS BITTER IN SOUL GATHERED TO HIM

AND HE BECAME CAPTAIN OVER THEM

AND THERE WERE WITH HIM ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEN

AND DAVID WENT FROM THERE TO MIZPEH OF MOAB

AND HE SAID TO THE KING OF MOAB PLEASE LET MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER STAY WITH YOU TILL I KNOW WHAT GOD WILL DO FOR ME

 AND HE LEFT THEM WITH THE KING OF MOAB AND THEY STAYED WITH HIM ALL THE TIME THAT DAVID WAS IN THE STRONGHOLD

THEN THE PROPHET GAD SAID TO DAVID DO NOT REMAIN IN THE STRONGHOLD; DEPART AND GO INTO THE LAND OF JUDAH

 SO DAVID DEPARTED AND WENT INTO THE FOREST OF HERETH

NOW SAUL HEARD THAT DAVID WAS DISCOVERED AND THE MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM

SAUL WAS SITTING AT GIBEAH UNDER THE TAMARISK TREE ON THE HEIGHT WITH HIS SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND ALL HIS SERVANTS WERE STANDING ABOUT HIM

AND SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANTS WHO STOOD ABOUT HIM HEAR NOW PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN; WILL THE SON OF JESSE GIVE EVERY ONE OF YOU FIELDS AND VINEYARDS WILL HE MAKE YOU ALL COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE CONSPIRED AGAINST ME

NO ONE DISCLOSES TO ME WHEN MY SON MAKES A COVENANT WITH THE SON OF JESSE

NONE OF YOU IS SORRY FOR ME OR DISCLOSES TO ME THAT MY SON HAS STIRRED UP MY SERVANT AGAINST ME TO LIE IN WAIT AS AT THIS DAY

 THEN ANSWERED DOEG THE EDOMITE WHO STOOD BY THE SERVANTS OF SAUL I SAW THE SON OF JESSE COMING TO NOB TO AHIMELECH THE SON OF AHITUB AND HE INQUIRED OF THE LORD FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM PROVISIONS AND GAVE HIM THE SWORD OF GOLIATH THE PHILISTINE

 THEN THE KING SENT TO SUMMON AHIMELECH THE PRIEST THE SON OF AHITUB AND ALL HIS FATHER'S HOUSE THE PRIESTS WHO WERE AT NOB AND ALL OF THEM CAME TO THE KING

AND SAUL SAID HEAR NOW SON OF AHITUB

 AND HE ANSWERED HERE I AM MY LORD

 AND SAUL SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOU CONSPIRED AGAINST ME YOU AND THE SON OF JESSE IN THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM BREAD AND A SWORD AND HAVE INQUIRED OF GOD FOR HIM SO THAT HE HAS RISEN AGAINST ME TO LIE IN WAIT AS AT THIS DAY

 THEN AHIMELECH ANSWERED THE KING AND WHO AMONG ALL YOUR SERVANTS IS SO FAITHFUL AS DAVID WHO IS THE KING'S SONINLAW AND CAPTAIN OVER YOUR BODYGUARD AND HONORED IN YOUR HOUSE

IS TODAY THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE INQUIRED OF GOD FOR HIM

NO

LET NOT THE KING IMPUTE ANYTHING TO HIS SERVANT OR TO ALL THE HOUSE OF MY FATHER FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS KNOWN NOTHING OF ALL THIS MUCH OR LITTLE

 AND THE KING SAID YOU SHALL SURELY DIE AHIMELECH YOU AND ALL YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE

 AND THE KING SAID TO THE GUARD WHO STOOD ABOUT HIM TURN AND KILL THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD BECAUSE THEIR HAND ALSO IS WITH DAVID AND THEY KNEW THAT HE FLED AND DID NOT DISCLOSE IT TO ME

 BUT THE SERVANTS OF THE KING WOULD NOT PUT OUT THEIR HAND TO STRIKE THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD

THEN THE KING SAID TO DOEG YOU TURN AND STRIKE THE PRIESTS

 AND DOEG THE EDOMITE TURNED AND STRUCK DOWN THE PRIESTS AND HE KILLED ON THAT DAY EIGHTYFIVE PERSONS WHO WORE THE LINEN EPHOD

AND NOB THE CITY OF THE PRIESTS HE PUT TO THE SWORD; BOTH MAN AND WOMAN CHILD AND INFANT OX DONKEY AND SHEEP HE PUT TO THE SWORD

BUT ONE OF THE SONS OF AHIMELECH THE SON OF AHITUB NAMED ABIATHAR ESCAPED AND FLED AFTER DAVID

AND ABIATHAR TOLD DAVID THAT SAUL HAD KILLED THE PRIESTS OF THE LORD

AND DAVID SAID TO ABIATHAR I KNEW ON THAT DAY WHEN DOEG THE EDOMITE WAS THERE THAT HE WOULD SURELY TELL SAUL

I HAVE OCCASIONED THE DEATH OF ALL THE PERSONS OF YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE

STAY WITH ME; DO NOT BE AFRAID FOR HE WHO SEEKS MY LIFE SEEKS YOUR LIFE

WITH ME YOU SHALL BE IN SAFEKEEPING

NOW THEY TOLD DAVID BEHOLD THE PHILISTINES ARE FIGHTING AGAINST KEILAH AND ARE ROBBING THE THRESHING FLOORS

 THEREFORE DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD SHALL I GO AND ATTACK THESE PHILISTINES

 AND THE LORD SAID TO DAVID GO AND ATTACK THE PHILISTINES AND SAVE KEILAH

 BUT DAVID'S MEN SAID TO HIM BEHOLD WE ARE AFRAID HERE IN JUDAH; HOW MUCH MORE THEN IF WE GO TO KEILAH AGAINST THE ARMIES OF THE PHILISTINES

 THEN DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD AGAIN

AND THE LORD ANSWERED HIM ARISE GO DOWN TO KEILAH FOR I WILL GIVE THE PHILISTINES INTO YOUR HAND

 AND DAVID AND HIS MEN WENT TO KEILAH AND FOUGHT WITH THE PHILISTINES AND BROUGHT AWAY THEIR LIVESTOCK AND STRUCK THEM WITH A GREAT BLOW

SO DAVID SAVED THE INHABITANTS OF KEILAH

WHEN ABIATHAR THE SON OF AHIMELECH HAD FLED TO DAVID TO KEILAH HE HAD COME DOWN WITH AN EPHOD IN HIS HAND

NOW IT WAS TOLD SAUL THAT DAVID HAD COME TO KEILAH

AND SAUL SAID GOD HAS GIVEN HIM INTO MY HAND FOR HE HAS SHUT HIMSELF IN BY ENTERING A TOWN THAT HAS GATES AND BARS

 AND SAUL SUMMONED ALL THE PEOPLE TO WAR TO GO DOWN TO KEILAH TO BESIEGE DAVID AND HIS MEN

DAVID KNEW THAT SAUL WAS PLOTTING HARM AGAINST HIM

AND HE SAID TO ABIATHAR THE PRIEST BRING THE EPHOD HERE

 THEN SAID DAVID O LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOUR SERVANT HAS SURELY HEARD THAT SAUL SEEKS TO COME TO KEILAH TO DESTROY THE CITY ON MY ACCOUNT

WILL THE MEN OF KEILAH SURRENDER ME INTO HIS HAND

WILL SAUL COME DOWN AS YOUR SERVANT HAS HEARD

O LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL PLEASE TELL YOUR SERVANT

 AND THE LORD SAID HE WILL COME DOWN

 THEN DAVID SAID WILL THE MEN OF KEILAH SURRENDER ME AND MY MEN INTO THE HAND OF SAUL

 AND THE LORD SAID THEY WILL SURRENDER YOU

 THEN DAVID AND HIS MEN WHO WERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AROSE AND DEPARTED FROM KEILAH AND THEY WENT WHEREVER THEY COULD GO

WHEN SAUL WAS TOLD THAT DAVID HAD ESCAPED FROM KEILAH HE GAVE UP THE EXPEDITION

AND DAVID REMAINED IN THE STRONGHOLDS IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH

AND SAUL SOUGHT HIM EVERY DAY BUT GOD DID NOT GIVE HIM INTO HIS HAND

DAVID SAW THAT SAUL HAD COME OUT TO SEEK HIS LIFE

DAVID WAS IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH AT HORESH

AND JONATHAN SAUL'S SON ROSE AND WENT TO DAVID AT HORESH AND STRENGTHENED HIS HAND IN GOD

AND HE SAID TO HIM DO NOT FEAR FOR THE HAND OF SAUL MY FATHER SHALL NOT FIND YOU

YOU SHALL BE KING OVER ISRAEL AND I SHALL BE NEXT TO YOU

SAUL MY FATHER ALSO KNOWS THIS

 AND THE TWO OF THEM MADE A COVENANT BEFORE THE LORD

DAVID REMAINED AT HORESH AND JONATHAN WENT HOME

THEN THE ZIPHITES WENT UP TO SAUL AT GIBEAH SAYING IS NOT DAVID HIDING AMONG US IN THE STRONGHOLDS AT HORESH ON THE HILL OF HACHILAH WHICH IS SOUTH OF JESHIMON

NOW COME DOWN O KING ACCORDING TO ALL YOUR HEART'S DESIRE TO COME DOWN AND OUR PART SHALL BE TO SURRENDER HIM INTO THE KING'S HAND

 AND SAUL SAID MAY YOU BE BLESSED BY THE LORD FOR YOU HAVE HAD COMPASSION ON ME

GO MAKE YET MORE SURE

KNOW AND SEE THE PLACE WHERE HIS FOOT IS AND WHO HAS SEEN HIM THERE FOR IT IS TOLD ME THAT HE IS VERY CUNNING

SEE THEREFORE AND TAKE NOTE OF ALL THE LURKING PLACES WHERE HE HIDES AND COME BACK TO ME WITH SURE INFORMATION

THEN I WILL GO WITH YOU

AND IF HE IS IN THE LAND I WILL SEARCH HIM OUT AMONG ALL THE THOUSANDS OF JUDAH

 AND THEY AROSE AND WENT TO ZIPH AHEAD OF SAUL

NOW DAVID AND HIS MEN WERE IN THE WILDERNESS OF MAON IN THE ARABAH TO THE SOUTH OF JESHIMON

AND SAUL AND HIS MEN WENT TO SEEK HIM

AND DAVID WAS TOLD SO HE WENT DOWN TO THE ROCK AND LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS OF MAON

AND WHEN SAUL HEARD THAT HE PURSUED AFTER DAVID IN THE WILDERNESS OF MAON

SAUL WENT ON ONE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND DAVID AND HIS MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN

AND DAVID WAS HURRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SAUL

AS SAUL AND HIS MEN WERE CLOSING IN ON DAVID AND HIS MEN TO CAPTURE THEM A MESSENGER CAME TO SAUL SAYING HURRY AND COME FOR THE PHILISTINES HAVE MADE A RAID AGAINST THE LAND

 SO SAUL RETURNED FROM PURSUING AFTER DAVID AND WENT AGAINST THE PHILISTINES

THEREFORE THAT PLACE WAS CALLED THE ROCK OF ESCAPE

AND DAVID WENT UP FROM THERE AND LIVED IN THE STRONGHOLDS OF ENGEDI

WHEN SAUL RETURNED FROM FOLLOWING THE PHILISTINES HE WAS TOLD BEHOLD DAVID IS IN THE WILDERNESS OF ENGEDI

 THEN SAUL TOOK THREE THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN OUT OF ALL ISRAEL AND WENT TO SEEK DAVID AND HIS MEN IN FRONT OF THE WILDGOATS' ROCKS

AND HE CAME TO THE SHEEPFOLDS BY THE WAY WHERE THERE WAS A CAVE AND SAUL WENT IN TO RELIEVE HIMSELF

NOW DAVID AND HIS MEN WERE SITTING IN THE INNERMOST PARTS OF THE CAVE

AND THE MEN OF DAVID SAID TO HIM HERE IS THE DAY OF WHICH THE LORD SAID TO YOU 'BEHOLD I WILL GIVE YOUR ENEMY INTO YOUR HAND AND YOU SHALL DO TO HIM AS IT SHALL SEEM GOOD TO YOU

' THEN DAVID AROSE AND STEALTHILY CUT OFF A CORNER OF SAUL'S ROBE

AND AFTERWARD DAVID'S HEART STRUCK HIM BECAUSE HE HAD CUT OFF A CORNER OF SAUL'S ROBE

HE SAID TO HIS MEN THE LORD FORBID THAT I SHOULD DO THIS THING TO MY LORD THE LORD'S ANOINTED TO PUT OUT MY HAND AGAINST HIM SEEING HE IS THE LORD'S ANOINTED

 SO DAVID PERSUADED HIS MEN WITH THESE WORDS AND DID NOT PERMIT THEM TO ATTACK SAUL

AND SAUL ROSE UP AND LEFT THE CAVE AND WENT ON HIS WAY

AFTERWARD DAVID ALSO AROSE AND WENT OUT OF THE CAVE AND CALLED AFTER SAUL MY LORD THE KING

 AND WHEN SAUL LOOKED BEHIND HIM DAVID BOWED WITH HIS FACE TO THE EARTH AND PAID HOMAGE

AND DAVID SAID TO SAUL WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF MEN WHO SAY 'BEHOLD DAVID SEEKS YOUR HARM'

BEHOLD THIS DAY YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN HOW THE LORD GAVE YOU TODAY INTO MY HAND IN THE CAVE

AND SOME TOLD ME TO KILL YOU BUT I SPARED YOU

I SAID 'I WILL NOT PUT OUT MY HAND AGAINST MY LORD FOR HE IS THE LORD'S ANOINTED

' SEE MY FATHER SEE THE CORNER OF YOUR ROBE IN MY HAND

FOR BY THE FACT THAT I CUT OFF THE CORNER OF YOUR ROBE AND DID NOT KILL YOU YOU MAY KNOW AND SEE THAT THERE IS NO WRONG OR TREASON IN MY HANDS

I HAVE NOT SINNED AGAINST YOU THOUGH YOU HUNT MY LIFE TO TAKE IT

MAY THE LORD JUDGE BETWEEN ME AND YOU MAY THE LORD AVENGE ME AGAINST YOU BUT MY HAND SHALL NOT BE AGAINST YOU

AS THE PROVERB OF THE ANCIENTS SAYS 'OUT OF THE WICKED COMES WICKEDNESS

' BUT MY HAND SHALL NOT BE AGAINST YOU

AFTER WHOM HAS THE KING OF ISRAEL COME OUT

AFTER WHOM DO YOU PURSUE

AFTER A DEAD DOG

AFTER A FLEA

MAY THE LORD THEREFORE BE JUDGE AND GIVE SENTENCE BETWEEN ME AND YOU AND SEE TO IT AND PLEAD MY CAUSE AND DELIVER ME FROM YOUR HAND

 AS SOON AS DAVID HAD FINISHED SPEAKING THESE WORDS TO SAUL SAUL SAID IS THIS YOUR VOICE MY SON DAVID

 AND SAUL LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT

HE SAID TO DAVID YOU ARE MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN I FOR YOU HAVE REPAID ME GOOD WHEREAS I HAVE REPAID YOU EVIL

AND YOU HAVE DECLARED THIS DAY HOW YOU HAVE DEALT WELL WITH ME IN THAT YOU DID NOT KILL ME WHEN THE LORD PUT ME INTO YOUR HANDS

FOR IF A MAN FINDS HIS ENEMY WILL HE LET HIM GO AWAY SAFE

SO MAY THE LORD REWARD YOU WITH GOOD FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME THIS DAY

AND NOW BEHOLD I KNOW THAT YOU SHALL SURELY BE KING AND THAT THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL SHALL BE ESTABLISHED IN YOUR HAND

SWEAR TO ME THEREFORE BY THE LORD THAT YOU WILL NOT CUT OFF MY OFFSPRING AFTER ME AND THAT YOU WILL NOT DESTROY MY NAME OUT OF MY FATHER'S HOUSE

 AND DAVID SWORE THIS TO SAUL

THEN SAUL WENT HOME BUT DAVID AND HIS MEN WENT UP TO THE STRONGHOLD

NOW SAMUEL DIED

AND ALL ISRAEL ASSEMBLED AND MOURNED FOR HIM AND THEY BURIED HIM IN HIS HOUSE AT RAMAH

THEN DAVID ROSE AND WENT DOWN TO THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN

AND THERE WAS A MAN IN MAON WHOSE BUSINESS WAS IN CARMEL

THE MAN WAS VERY RICH; HE HAD THREE THOUSAND SHEEP AND A THOUSAND GOATS

HE WAS SHEARING HIS SHEEP IN CARMEL

NOW THE NAME OF THE MAN WAS NABAL AND THE NAME OF HIS WIFE ABIGAIL

THE WOMAN WAS DISCERNING AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE MAN WAS HARSH AND BADLY BEHAVED; HE WAS A CALEBITE

DAVID HEARD IN THE WILDERNESS THAT NABAL WAS SHEARING HIS SHEEP

SO DAVID SENT TEN YOUNG MEN

AND DAVID SAID TO THE YOUNG MEN GO UP TO CARMEL AND GO TO NABAL AND GREET HIM IN MY NAME

AND THUS YOU SHALL GREET HIM 'PEACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE BE TO YOUR HOUSE AND PEACE BE TO ALL THAT YOU HAVE

I HEAR THAT YOU HAVE SHEARERS

NOW YOUR SHEPHERDS HAVE BEEN WITH US AND WE DID THEM NO HARM AND THEY MISSED NOTHING ALL THE TIME THEY WERE IN CARMEL

ASK YOUR YOUNG MEN AND THEY WILL TELL YOU

THEREFORE LET MY YOUNG MEN FIND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES FOR WE COME ON A FEAST DAY

PLEASE GIVE WHATEVER YOU HAVE AT HAND TO YOUR SERVANTS AND TO YOUR SON DAVID

' WHEN DAVID'S YOUNG MEN CAME THEY SAID ALL THIS TO NABAL IN THE NAME OF DAVID AND THEN THEY WAITED

AND NABAL ANSWERED DAVID'S SERVANTS WHO IS DAVID

WHO IS THE SON OF JESSE

THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS THESE DAYS WHO ARE BREAKING AWAY FROM THEIR MASTERS

SHALL I TAKE MY BREAD AND MY WATER AND MY MEAT THAT I HAVE KILLED FOR MY SHEARERS AND GIVE IT TO MEN WHO COME FROM I DO NOT KNOW WHERE

 SO DAVID'S YOUNG MEN TURNED AWAY AND CAME BACK AND TOLD HIM ALL THIS

AND DAVID SAID TO HIS MEN EVERY MAN STRAP ON HIS SWORD

 AND EVERY MAN OF THEM STRAPPED ON HIS SWORD

DAVID ALSO STRAPPED ON HIS SWORD

AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEN WENT UP AFTER DAVID WHILE TWO HUNDRED REMAINED WITH THE BAGGAGE

BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TOLD ABIGAIL NABAL'S WIFE BEHOLD DAVID SENT MESSENGERS OUT OF THE WILDERNESS TO GREET OUR MASTER AND HE RAILED AT THEM

YET THE MEN WERE VERY GOOD TO US AND WE SUFFERED NO HARM AND WE DID NOT MISS ANYTHING WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIELDS AS LONG AS WE WENT WITH THEM

THEY WERE A WALL TO US BOTH BY NIGHT AND BY DAY ALL THE WHILE WE WERE WITH THEM KEEPING THE SHEEP

NOW THEREFORE KNOW THIS AND CONSIDER WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FOR HARM IS DETERMINED AGAINST OUR MASTER AND AGAINST ALL HIS HOUSE AND HE IS SUCH A WORTHLESS MAN THAT ONE CANNOT SPEAK TO HIM

 THEN ABIGAIL MADE HASTE AND TOOK TWO HUNDRED LOAVES AND TWO SKINS OF WINE AND FIVE SHEEP ALREADY PREPARED AND FIVE SEAHS OF PARCHED GRAIN AND A HUNDRED CLUSTERS OF RAISINS AND TWO HUNDRED CAKES OF FIGS AND LAID THEM ON DONKEYS

AND SHE SAID TO HER YOUNG MEN GO ON BEFORE ME; BEHOLD I COME AFTER YOU

 BUT SHE DID NOT TELL HER HUSBAND NABAL

AND AS SHE RODE ON THE DONKEY AND CAME DOWN UNDER COVER OF THE MOUNTAIN BEHOLD DAVID AND HIS MEN CAME DOWN TOWARD HER AND SHE MET THEM

NOW DAVID HAD SAID SURELY IN VAIN HAVE I GUARDED ALL THAT THIS FELLOW HAS IN THE WILDERNESS SO THAT NOTHING WAS MISSED OF ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM AND HE HAS RETURNED ME EVIL FOR GOOD

GOD DO SO TO THE ENEMIES OF DAVID AND MORE ALSO IF BY MORNING I LEAVE SO MUCH AS ONE MALE OF ALL WHO BELONG TO HIM

 WHEN ABIGAIL SAW DAVID SHE HURRIED AND GOT DOWN FROM THE DONKEY AND FELL BEFORE DAVID ON HER FACE AND BOWED TO THE GROUND

SHE FELL AT HIS FEET AND SAID ON ME ALONE MY LORD BE THE GUILT

PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK IN YOUR EARS AND HEAR THE WORDS OF YOUR SERVANT

LET NOT MY LORD REGARD THIS WORTHLESS FELLOW NABAL FOR AS HIS NAME IS SO IS HE

NABAL IS HIS NAME AND FOLLY IS WITH HIM

BUT I YOUR SERVANT DID NOT SEE THE YOUNG MEN OF MY LORD WHOM YOU SENT

NOW THEN MY LORD AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOUR SOUL LIVES BECAUSE THE LORD HAS RESTRAINED YOU FROM BLOODGUILT AND FROM SAVING WITH YOUR OWN HAND NOW THEN LET YOUR ENEMIES AND THOSE WHO SEEK TO DO EVIL TO MY LORD BE AS NABAL

AND NOW LET THIS PRESENT THAT YOUR SERVANT HAS BROUGHT TO MY LORD BE GIVEN TO THE YOUNG MEN WHO FOLLOW MY LORD

PLEASE FORGIVE THE TRESPASS OF YOUR SERVANT

FOR THE LORD WILL CERTAINLY MAKE MY LORD A SURE HOUSE BECAUSE MY LORD IS FIGHTING THE BATTLES OF THE LORD AND EVIL SHALL NOT BE FOUND IN YOU SO LONG AS YOU LIVE

IF MEN RISE UP TO PURSUE YOU AND TO SEEK YOUR LIFE THE LIFE OF MY LORD SHALL BE BOUND IN THE BUNDLE OF THE LIVING IN THE CARE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

AND THE LIVES OF YOUR ENEMIES HE SHALL SLING OUT AS FROM THE HOLLOW OF A SLING

AND WHEN THE LORD HAS DONE TO MY LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAS SPOKEN CONCERNING YOU AND HAS APPOINTED YOU PRINCE OVER ISRAEL MY LORD SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE OF GRIEF OR PANGS OF CONSCIENCE FOR HAVING SHED BLOOD WITHOUT CAUSE OR FOR MY LORD TAKING VENGEANCE HIMSELF

AND WHEN THE LORD HAS DEALT WELL WITH MY LORD THEN REMEMBER YOUR SERVANT

 AND DAVID SAID TO ABIGAIL BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO SENT YOU THIS DAY TO MEET ME

BLESSED BE YOUR DISCRETION AND BLESSED BE YOU WHO HAVE KEPT ME THIS DAY FROM BLOODGUILT AND FROM AVENGING MYSELF WITH MY OWN HAND

FOR AS SURELY AS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL LIVES WHO HAS RESTRAINED ME FROM HURTING YOU UNLESS YOU HAD HURRIED AND COME TO MEET ME TRULY BY MORNING THERE HAD NOT BEEN LEFT TO NABAL SO MUCH AS ONE MALE

 THEN DAVID RECEIVED FROM HER HAND WHAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM

AND HE SAID TO HER GO UP IN PEACE TO YOUR HOUSE

SEE I HAVE OBEYED YOUR VOICE AND I HAVE GRANTED YOUR PETITION

 AND ABIGAIL CAME TO NABAL AND BEHOLD HE WAS HOLDING A FEAST IN HIS HOUSE LIKE THE FEAST OF A KING

AND NABAL'S HEART WAS MERRY WITHIN HIM FOR HE WAS VERY DRUNK

SO SHE TOLD HIM NOTHING AT ALL UNTIL THE MORNING LIGHT

IN THE MORNING WHEN THE WINE HAD GONE OUT OF NABAL HIS WIFE TOLD HIM THESE THINGS AND HIS HEART DIED WITHIN HIM AND HE BECAME AS A STONE

AND ABOUT TEN DAYS LATER THE LORD STRUCK NABAL AND HE DIED

WHEN DAVID HEARD THAT NABAL WAS DEAD HE SAID BLESSED BE THE LORD WHO HAS AVENGED THE INSULT I RECEIVED AT THE HAND OF NABAL AND HAS KEPT BACK HIS SERVANT FROM WRONGDOING

THE LORD HAS RETURNED THE EVIL OF NABAL ON HIS OWN HEAD

 THEN DAVID SENT AND SPOKE TO ABIGAIL TO TAKE HER AS HIS WIFE

WHEN THE SERVANTS OF DAVID CAME TO ABIGAIL AT CARMEL THEY SAID TO HER DAVID HAS SENT US TO YOU TO TAKE YOU TO HIM AS HIS WIFE

 AND SHE ROSE AND BOWED WITH HER FACE TO THE GROUND AND SAID BEHOLD YOUR HANDMAID IS A SERVANT TO WASH THE FEET OF THE SERVANTS OF MY LORD

 AND ABIGAIL HURRIED AND ROSE AND MOUNTED A DONKEY AND HER FIVE YOUNG WOMEN ATTENDED HER

SHE FOLLOWED THE MESSENGERS OF DAVID AND BECAME HIS WIFE

DAVID ALSO TOOK AHINOAM OF JEZREEL AND BOTH OF THEM BECAME HIS WIVES

SAUL HAD GIVEN MICHAL HIS DAUGHTER DAVID'S WIFE TO PALTI THE SON OF LAISH WHO WAS OF GALLIM

THEN THE ZIPHITES CAME TO SAUL AT GIBEAH SAYING IS NOT DAVID HIDING HIMSELF ON THE HILL OF HACHILAH WHICH IS ON THE EAST OF JESHIMON

 SO SAUL AROSE AND WENT DOWN TO THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH WITH THREE THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN OF ISRAEL TO SEEK DAVID IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH

AND SAUL ENCAMPED ON THE HILL OF HACHILAH WHICH IS BESIDE THE ROAD ON THE EAST OF JESHIMON

BUT DAVID REMAINED IN THE WILDERNESS

WHEN HE SAW THAT SAUL CAME AFTER HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS DAVID SENT OUT SPIES AND LEARNED THAT SAUL HAD COME

THEN DAVID ROSE AND CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE SAUL HAD ENCAMPED

AND DAVID SAW THE PLACE WHERE SAUL LAY WITH ABNER THE SON OF NER THE COMMANDER OF HIS ARMY

SAUL WAS LYING WITHIN THE ENCAMPMENT WHILE THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AROUND HIM

THEN DAVID SAID TO AHIMELECH THE HITTITE AND TO JOAB'S BROTHER ABISHAI THE SON OF ZERUIAH WHO WILL GO DOWN WITH ME INTO THE CAMP TO SAUL

 AND ABISHAI SAID I WILL GO DOWN WITH YOU

 SO DAVID AND ABISHAI WENT TO THE ARMY BY NIGHT

AND THERE LAY SAUL SLEEPING WITHIN THE ENCAMPMENT WITH HIS SPEAR STUCK IN THE GROUND AT HIS HEAD AND ABNER AND THE ARMY LAY AROUND HIM

THEN SAID ABISHAI TO DAVID GOD HAS GIVEN YOUR ENEMY INTO YOUR HAND THIS DAY

NOW PLEASE LET ME PIN HIM TO THE EARTH WITH ONE STROKE OF THE SPEAR AND I WILL NOT STRIKE HIM TWICE

 BUT DAVID SAID TO ABISHAI DO NOT DESTROY HIM FOR WHO CAN PUT OUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE LORD'S ANOINTED AND BE GUILTLESS

 AND DAVID SAID AS THE LORD LIVES THE LORD WILL STRIKE HIM OR HIS DAY WILL COME TO DIE OR HE WILL GO DOWN INTO BATTLE AND PERISH

THE LORD FORBID THAT I SHOULD PUT OUT MY HAND AGAINST THE LORD'S ANOINTED

BUT TAKE NOW THE SPEAR THAT IS AT HIS HEAD AND THE JAR OF WATER AND LET US GO

 SO DAVID TOOK THE SPEAR AND THE JAR OF WATER FROM SAUL'S HEAD AND THEY WENT AWAY

NO MAN SAW IT OR KNEW IT NOR DID ANY AWAKE FOR THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP BECAUSE A DEEP SLEEP FROM THE LORD HAD FALLEN UPON THEM

THEN DAVID WENT OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AND STOOD FAR OFF ON THE TOP OF THE HILL WITH A GREAT SPACE BETWEEN THEM

AND DAVID CALLED TO THE ARMY AND TO ABNER THE SON OF NER SAYING WILL YOU NOT ANSWER ABNER

 THEN ABNER ANSWERED WHO ARE YOU WHO CALLS TO THE KING

 AND DAVID SAID TO ABNER ARE YOU NOT A MAN

WHO IS LIKE YOU IN ISRAEL

WHY THEN HAVE YOU NOT KEPT WATCH OVER YOUR LORD THE KING

FOR ONE OF THE PEOPLE CAME IN TO DESTROY THE KING YOUR LORD

THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE DONE IS NOT GOOD

AS THE LORD LIVES YOU DESERVE TO DIE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT KEPT WATCH OVER YOUR LORD THE LORD'S ANOINTED

AND NOW SEE WHERE THE KING'S SPEAR IS AND THE JAR OF WATER THAT WAS AT HIS HEAD

 SAUL RECOGNIZED DAVID'S VOICE AND SAID IS THIS YOUR VOICE MY SON DAVID

 AND DAVID SAID IT IS MY VOICE MY LORD O KING

 AND HE SAID WHY DOES MY LORD PURSUE AFTER HIS SERVANT

FOR WHAT HAVE I DONE

WHAT EVIL IS ON MY HANDS

NOW THEREFORE LET MY LORD THE KING HEAR THE WORDS OF HIS SERVANT

IF IT IS THE LORD WHO HAS STIRRED YOU UP AGAINST ME MAY HE ACCEPT AN OFFERING BUT IF IT IS MEN MAY THEY BE CURSED BEFORE THE LORD FOR THEY HAVE DRIVEN ME OUT THIS DAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO SHARE IN THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD SAYING 'GO SERVE OTHER GODS

' NOW THEREFORE LET NOT MY BLOOD FALL TO THE EARTH AWAY FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL HAS COME OUT TO SEEK A SINGLE FLEA LIKE ONE WHO HUNTS A PARTRIDGE IN THE MOUNTAINS

 THEN SAUL SAID I HAVE SINNED

RETURN MY SON DAVID FOR I WILL NO MORE DO YOU HARM BECAUSE MY LIFE WAS PRECIOUS IN YOUR EYES THIS DAY

BEHOLD I HAVE ACTED FOOLISHLY AND HAVE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE

 AND DAVID ANSWERED AND SAID HERE IS THE SPEAR O KING

LET ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN COME OVER AND TAKE IT

THE LORD REWARDS EVERY MAN FOR HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS FAITHFULNESS FOR THE LORD GAVE YOU INTO MY HAND TODAY AND I WOULD NOT PUT OUT MY HAND AGAINST THE LORD'S ANOINTED

BEHOLD AS YOUR LIFE WAS PRECIOUS THIS DAY IN MY SIGHT SO MAY MY LIFE BE PRECIOUS IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND MAY HE DELIVER ME OUT OF ALL TRIBULATION

 THEN SAUL SAID TO DAVID BLESSED BE YOU MY SON DAVID

YOU WILL DO MANY THINGS AND WILL SUCCEED IN THEM

 SO DAVID WENT HIS WAY AND SAUL RETURNED TO HIS PLACE

THEN DAVID SAID IN HIS HEART NOW I SHALL PERISH ONE DAY BY THE HAND OF SAUL

THERE IS NOTHING BETTER FOR ME THAN THAT I SHOULD ESCAPE TO THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES

THEN SAUL WILL DESPAIR OF SEEKING ME ANY LONGER WITHIN THE BORDERS OF ISRAEL AND I SHALL ESCAPE OUT OF HIS HAND

 SO DAVID AROSE AND WENT OVER HE AND THE SIX HUNDRED MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM TO ACHISH THE SON OF MAOCH KING OF GATH

AND DAVID LIVED WITH ACHISH AT GATH HE AND HIS MEN EVERY MAN WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD AND DAVID WITH HIS TWO WIVES AHINOAM OF JEZREEL AND ABIGAIL OF CARMEL NABAL'S WIDOW

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD SAUL THAT DAVID HAD FLED TO GATH HE NO LONGER SOUGHT HIM

THEN DAVID SAID TO ACHISH IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES LET A PLACE BE GIVEN ME IN ONE OF THE COUNTRY TOWNS THAT I MAY DWELL THERE

FOR WHY SHOULD YOUR SERVANT DWELL IN THE ROYAL CITY WITH YOU

 SO THAT DAY ACHISH GAVE HIM ZIKLAG

THEREFORE ZIKLAG HAS BELONGED TO THE KINGS OF JUDAH TO THIS DAY

AND THE NUMBER OF THE DAYS THAT DAVID LIVED IN THE COUNTRY OF THE PHILISTINES WAS A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS

NOW DAVID AND HIS MEN WENT UP AND MADE RAIDS AGAINST THE GESHURITES THE GIRZITES AND THE AMALEKITES FOR THESE WERE THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND FROM OF OLD AS FAR AS SHUR TO THE LAND OF EGYPT

AND DAVID WOULD STRIKE THE LAND AND WOULD LEAVE NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN ALIVE BUT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE SHEEP THE OXEN THE DONKEYS THE CAMELS AND THE GARMENTS AND COME BACK TO ACHISH

WHEN ACHISH ASKED WHERE HAVE YOU MADE A RAID TODAY

 DAVID WOULD SAY AGAINST THE NEGEB OF JUDAH OR AGAINST THE NEGEB OF THE JERAHMEELITES OR AGAINST THE NEGEB OF THE KENITES

 AND DAVID WOULD LEAVE NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN ALIVE TO BRING NEWS TO GATH THINKING LEST THEY SHOULD TELL ABOUT US AND SAY 'SO DAVID HAS DONE

' SUCH WAS HIS CUSTOM ALL THE WHILE HE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY OF THE PHILISTINES

AND ACHISH TRUSTED DAVID THINKING HE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN UTTER STENCH TO HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL; THEREFORE HE SHALL ALWAYS BE MY SERVANT

IN THOSE DAYS THE PHILISTINES GATHERED THEIR FORCES FOR WAR TO FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

AND ACHISH SAID TO DAVID UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR MEN ARE TO GO OUT WITH ME IN THE ARMY

 DAVID SAID TO ACHISH VERY WELL YOU SHALL KNOW WHAT YOUR SERVANT CAN DO

 AND ACHISH SAID TO DAVID VERY WELL I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODYGUARD FOR LIFE

 NOW SAMUEL HAD DIED AND ALL ISRAEL HAD MOURNED FOR HIM AND BURIED HIM IN RAMAH HIS OWN CITY

AND SAUL HAD PUT THE MEDIUMS AND THE NECROMANCERS OUT OF THE LAND

THE PHILISTINES ASSEMBLED AND CAME AND ENCAMPED AT SHUNEM

AND SAUL GATHERED ALL ISRAEL AND THEY ENCAMPED AT GILBOA

WHEN SAUL SAW THE ARMY OF THE PHILISTINES HE WAS AFRAID AND HIS HEART TREMBLED GREATLY

AND WHEN SAUL INQUIRED OF THE LORD THE LORD DID NOT ANSWER HIM EITHER BY DREAMS OR BY URIM OR BY PROPHETS

THEN SAUL SAID TO HIS SERVANTS SEEK OUT FOR ME A WOMAN WHO IS A MEDIUM THAT I MAY GO TO HER AND INQUIRE OF HER

 AND HIS SERVANTS SAID TO HIM BEHOLD THERE IS A MEDIUM AT ENDOR

 SO SAUL DISGUISED HIMSELF AND PUT ON OTHER GARMENTS AND WENT HE AND TWO MEN WITH HIM

AND THEY CAME TO THE WOMAN BY NIGHT

AND HE SAID DIVINE FOR ME BY A SPIRIT AND BRING UP FOR ME WHOMEVER I SHALL NAME TO YOU

 THE WOMAN SAID TO HIM SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT SAUL HAS DONE HOW HE HAS CUT OFF THE MEDIUMS AND THE NECROMANCERS FROM THE LAND

WHY THEN ARE YOU LAYING A TRAP FOR MY LIFE TO BRING ABOUT MY DEATH

 BUT SAUL SWORE TO HER BY THE LORD AS THE LORD LIVES NO PUNISHMENT SHALL COME UPON YOU FOR THIS THING

 THEN THE WOMAN SAID WHOM SHALL I BRING UP FOR YOU

 HE SAID BRING UP SAMUEL FOR ME

 WHEN THE WOMAN SAW SAMUEL SHE CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE

AND THE WOMAN SAID TO SAUL WHY HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME

YOU ARE SAUL

 THE KING SAID TO HER DO NOT BE AFRAID

WHAT DO YOU SEE

 AND THE WOMAN SAID TO SAUL I SEE A GOD COMING UP OUT OF THE EARTH

 HE SAID TO HER WHAT IS HIS APPEARANCE

 AND SHE SAID AN OLD MAN IS COMING UP AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE

 AND SAUL KNEW THAT IT WAS SAMUEL AND HE BOWED WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND PAID HOMAGE

THEN SAMUEL SAID TO SAUL WHY HAVE YOU DISTURBED ME BY BRINGING ME UP

 SAUL ANSWERED I AM IN GREAT DISTRESS FOR THE PHILISTINES ARE WARRING AGAINST ME AND GOD HAS TURNED AWAY FROM ME AND ANSWERS ME NO MORE EITHER BY PROPHETS OR BY DREAMS

THEREFORE I HAVE SUMMONED YOU TO TELL ME WHAT I SHALL DO

 AND SAMUEL SAID WHY THEN DO YOU ASK ME SINCE THE LORD HAS TURNED FROM YOU AND BECOME YOUR ENEMY

THE LORD HAS DONE TO YOU AS HE SPOKE BY ME FOR THE LORD HAS TORN THE KINGDOM OUT OF YOUR HAND AND GIVEN IT TO YOUR NEIGHBOR DAVID

BECAUSE YOU DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD AND DID NOT CARRY OUT HIS FIERCE WRATH AGAINST AMALEK THEREFORE THE LORD HAS DONE THIS THING TO YOU THIS DAY

MOREOVER THE LORD WILL GIVE ISRAEL ALSO WITH YOU INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND TOMORROW YOU AND YOUR SONS SHALL BE WITH ME

THE LORD WILL GIVE THE ARMY OF ISRAEL ALSO INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES

 THEN SAUL FELL AT ONCE FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND FILLED WITH FEAR BECAUSE OF THE WORDS OF SAMUEL

AND THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN HIM FOR HE HAD EATEN NOTHING ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT

AND THE WOMAN CAME TO SAUL AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE WAS TERRIFIED SHE SAID TO HIM BEHOLD YOUR SERVANT HAS OBEYED YOU

I HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE IN MY HAND AND HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID TO ME

NOW THEREFORE YOU ALSO OBEY YOUR SERVANT

LET ME SET A MORSEL OF BREAD BEFORE YOU; AND EAT THAT YOU MAY HAVE STRENGTH WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR WAY

 HE REFUSED AND SAID I WILL NOT EAT

 BUT HIS SERVANTS TOGETHER WITH THE WOMAN URGED HIM AND HE LISTENED TO THEIR WORDS

SO HE AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND SAT ON THE BED

NOW THE WOMAN HAD A FATTENED CALF IN THE HOUSE AND SHE QUICKLY KILLED IT AND SHE TOOK FLOUR AND KNEADED IT AND BAKED UNLEAVENED BREAD OF IT AND SHE PUT IT BEFORE SAUL AND HIS SERVANTS AND THEY ATE

THEN THEY ROSE AND WENT AWAY THAT NIGHT

NOW THE PHILISTINES HAD GATHERED ALL THEIR FORCES AT APHEK

AND THE ISRAELITES WERE ENCAMPED BY THE SPRING THAT IS IN JEZREEL

AS THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES WERE PASSING ON BY HUNDREDS AND BY THOUSANDS AND DAVID AND HIS MEN WERE PASSING ON IN THE REAR WITH ACHISH THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES SAID WHAT ARE THESE HEBREWS DOING HERE

 AND ACHISH SAID TO THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES IS THIS NOT DAVID THE SERVANT OF SAUL KING OF ISRAEL WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME NOW FOR DAYS AND YEARS AND SINCE HE DESERTED TO ME I HAVE FOUND NO FAULT IN HIM TO THIS DAY

 BUT THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES WERE ANGRY WITH HIM

AND THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES SAID TO HIM SEND THE MAN BACK THAT HE MAY RETURN TO THE PLACE TO WHICH YOU HAVE ASSIGNED HIM

HE SHALL NOT GO DOWN WITH US TO BATTLE LEST IN THE BATTLE HE BECOME AN ADVERSARY TO US

FOR HOW COULD THIS FELLOW RECONCILE HIMSELF TO HIS LORD

WOULD IT NOT BE WITH THE HEADS OF THE MEN HERE

IS NOT THIS DAVID OF WHOM THEY SING TO ONE ANOTHER IN DANCES 'SAUL HAS STRUCK DOWN HIS THOUSANDS AND DAVID HIS TEN THOUSANDS'

 THEN ACHISH CALLED DAVID AND SAID TO HIM AS THE LORD LIVES YOU HAVE BEEN HONEST AND TO ME IT SEEMS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD MARCH OUT AND IN WITH ME IN THE CAMPAIGN

FOR I HAVE FOUND NOTHING WRONG IN YOU FROM THE DAY OF YOUR COMING TO ME TO THIS DAY

NEVERTHELESS THE LORDS DO NOT APPROVE OF YOU

SO GO BACK NOW; AND GO PEACEABLY THAT YOU MAY NOT DISPLEASE THE LORDS OF THE PHILISTINES

 AND DAVID SAID TO ACHISH BUT WHAT HAVE I DONE

WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN YOUR SERVANT FROM THE DAY I ENTERED YOUR SERVICE UNTIL NOW THAT I MAY NOT GO AND FIGHT AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF MY LORD THE KING

 AND ACHISH ANSWERED DAVID AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AS BLAMELESS IN MY SIGHT AS AN ANGEL OF GOD

NEVERTHELESS THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES HAVE SAID 'HE SHALL NOT GO UP WITH US TO THE BATTLE

' NOW THEN RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH THE SERVANTS OF YOUR LORD WHO CAME WITH YOU AND START EARLY IN THE MORNING AND DEPART AS SOON AS YOU HAVE LIGHT

 SO DAVID SET OUT WITH HIS MEN EARLY IN THE MORNING TO RETURN TO THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES

BUT THE PHILISTINES WENT UP TO JEZREEL

NOW WHEN DAVID AND HIS MEN CAME TO ZIKLAG ON THE THIRD DAY THE AMALEKITES HAD MADE A RAID AGAINST THE NEGEB AND AGAINST ZIKLAG

THEY HAD OVERCOME ZIKLAG AND BURNED IT WITH FIRE AND TAKEN CAPTIVE THE WOMEN AND ALL WHO WERE IN IT BOTH SMALL AND GREAT

THEY KILLED NO ONE BUT CARRIED THEM OFF AND WENT THEIR WAY

AND WHEN DAVID AND HIS MEN CAME TO THE CITY THEY FOUND IT BURNED WITH FIRE AND THEIR WIVES AND SONS AND DAUGHTERS TAKEN CAPTIVE

THEN DAVID AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM RAISED THEIR VOICES AND WEPT UNTIL THEY HAD NO MORE STRENGTH TO WEEP

DAVID'S TWO WIVES ALSO HAD BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE AHINOAM OF JEZREEL AND ABIGAIL THE WIDOW OF NABAL OF CARMEL

AND DAVID WAS GREATLY DISTRESSED FOR THE PEOPLE SPOKE OF STONING HIM BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE WERE BITTER IN SOUL EACH FOR HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS

BUT DAVID STRENGTHENED HIMSELF IN THE LORD HIS GOD

AND DAVID SAID TO ABIATHAR THE PRIEST THE SON OF AHIMELECH BRING ME THE EPHOD

 SO ABIATHAR BROUGHT THE EPHOD TO DAVID

AND DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD SHALL I PURSUE AFTER THIS BAND

SHALL I OVERTAKE THEM

 HE ANSWERED HIM PURSUE FOR YOU SHALL SURELY OVERTAKE AND SHALL SURELY RESCUE

 SO DAVID SET OUT AND THE SIX HUNDRED MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM AND THEY CAME TO THE BROOK BESOR WHERE THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND STAYED

BUT DAVID PURSUED HE AND FOUR HUNDRED MEN

TWO HUNDRED STAYED BEHIND WHO WERE TOO EXHAUSTED TO CROSS THE BROOK BESOR

THEY FOUND AN EGYPTIAN IN THE OPEN COUNTRY AND BROUGHT HIM TO DAVID

AND THEY GAVE HIM BREAD AND HE ATE

THEY GAVE HIM WATER TO DRINK AND THEY GAVE HIM A PIECE OF A CAKE OF FIGS AND TWO CLUSTERS OF RAISINS

AND WHEN HE HAD EATEN HIS SPIRIT REVIVED FOR HE HAD NOT EATEN BREAD OR DRUNK WATER FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS

AND DAVID SAID TO HIM TO WHOM DO YOU BELONG

AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM

 HE SAID I AM A YOUNG MAN OF EGYPT SERVANT TO AN AMALEKITE AND MY MASTER LEFT ME BEHIND BECAUSE I FELL SICK THREE DAYS AGO

WE HAD MADE A RAID AGAINST THE NEGEB OF THE CHERETHITES AND AGAINST THAT WHICH BELONGS TO JUDAH AND AGAINST THE NEGEB OF CALEB AND WE BURNED ZIKLAG WITH FIRE

 AND DAVID SAID TO HIM WILL YOU TAKE ME DOWN TO THIS BAND

 AND HE SAID SWEAR TO ME BY GOD THAT YOU WILL NOT KILL ME OR DELIVER ME INTO THE HANDS OF MY MASTER AND I WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THIS BAND

 AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN HIM DOWN BEHOLD THEY WERE SPREAD ABROAD OVER ALL THE LAND EATING AND DRINKING AND DANCING BECAUSE OF ALL THE GREAT SPOIL THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES AND FROM THE LAND OF JUDAH

AND DAVID STRUCK THEM DOWN FROM TWILIGHT UNTIL THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAY AND NOT A MAN OF THEM ESCAPED EXCEPT FOUR HUNDRED YOUNG MEN WHO MOUNTED CAMELS AND FLED

DAVID RECOVERED ALL THAT THE AMALEKITES HAD TAKEN AND DAVID RESCUED HIS TWO WIVES

NOTHING WAS MISSING WHETHER SMALL OR GREAT SONS OR DAUGHTERS SPOIL OR ANYTHING THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN

DAVID BROUGHT BACK ALL

DAVID ALSO CAPTURED ALL THE FLOCKS AND HERDS AND THE PEOPLE DROVE THE LIVESTOCK BEFORE HIM AND SAID THIS IS DAVID'S SPOIL

 THEN DAVID CAME TO THE TWO HUNDRED MEN WHO HAD BEEN TOO EXHAUSTED TO FOLLOW DAVID AND WHO HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE BROOK BESOR

AND THEY WENT OUT TO MEET DAVID AND TO MEET THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND WHEN DAVID CAME NEAR TO THE PEOPLE HE GREETED THEM

THEN ALL THE WICKED AND WORTHLESS FELLOWS AMONG THE MEN WHO HAD GONE WITH DAVID SAID BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GO WITH US WE WILL NOT GIVE THEM ANY OF THE SPOIL THAT WE HAVE RECOVERED EXCEPT THAT EACH MAN MAY LEAD AWAY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND DEPART

 BUT DAVID SAID YOU SHALL NOT DO SO MY BROTHERS WITH WHAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN US

HE HAS PRESERVED US AND GIVEN INTO OUR HAND THE BAND THAT CAME AGAINST US

WHO WOULD LISTEN TO YOU IN THIS MATTER

FOR AS HIS SHARE IS WHO GOES DOWN INTO THE BATTLE SO SHALL HIS SHARE BE WHO STAYS BY THE BAGGAGE

THEY SHALL SHARE ALIKE

 AND HE MADE IT A STATUTE AND A RULE FOR ISRAEL FROM THAT DAY FORWARD TO THIS DAY

WHEN DAVID CAME TO ZIKLAG HE SENT PART OF THE SPOIL TO HIS FRIENDS THE ELDERS OF JUDAH SAYING HERE IS A PRESENT FOR YOU FROM THE SPOIL OF THE ENEMIES OF THE LORD

 IT WAS FOR THOSE IN BETHEL IN RAMOTH OF THE NEGEB IN JATTIR IN AROER IN SIPHMOTH IN ESHTEMOA IN RACAL IN THE CITIES OF THE JERAHMEELITES IN THE CITIES OF THE KENITES IN HORMAH IN BORASHAN IN ATHACH IN HEBRON FOR ALL THE PLACES WHERE DAVID AND HIS MEN HAD ROAMED

NOW THE PHILISTINES FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL FLED BEFORE THE PHILISTINES AND FELL SLAIN ON MOUNT GILBOA

AND THE PHILISTINES OVERTOOK SAUL AND HIS SONS AND THE PHILISTINES STRUCK DOWN JONATHAN AND ABINADAB AND MALCHISHUA THE SONS OF SAUL

THE BATTLE PRESSED HARD AGAINST SAUL AND THE ARCHERS FOUND HIM AND HE WAS BADLY WOUNDED BY THE ARCHERS

THEN SAUL SAID TO HIS ARMORBEARER DRAW YOUR SWORD AND THRUST ME THROUGH WITH IT LEST THESE UNCIRCUMCISED COME AND THRUST ME THROUGH AND MISTREAT ME

 BUT HIS ARMORBEARER WOULD NOT FOR HE FEARED GREATLY

THEREFORE SAUL TOOK HIS OWN SWORD AND FELL UPON IT

AND WHEN HIS ARMORBEARER SAW THAT SAUL WAS DEAD HE ALSO FELL UPON HIS SWORD AND DIED WITH HIM

THUS SAUL DIED AND HIS THREE SONS AND HIS ARMORBEARER AND ALL HIS MEN ON THE SAME DAY TOGETHER

AND WHEN THE MEN OF ISRAEL WHO WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY AND THOSE BEYOND THE JORDAN SAW THAT THE MEN OF ISRAEL HAD FLED AND THAT SAUL AND HIS SONS WERE DEAD THEY ABANDONED THEIR CITIES AND FLED

AND THE PHILISTINES CAME AND LIVED IN THEM

THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE PHILISTINES CAME TO STRIP THE SLAIN THEY FOUND SAUL AND HIS THREE SONS FALLEN ON MOUNT GILBOA

SO THEY CUT OFF HIS HEAD AND STRIPPED OFF HIS ARMOR AND SENT MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES TO CARRY THE GOOD NEWS TO THE HOUSE OF THEIR IDOLS AND TO THE PEOPLE

THEY PUT HIS ARMOR IN THE TEMPLE OF ASHTAROTH AND THEY FASTENED HIS BODY TO THE WALL OF BETHSHAN

BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF JABESHGILEAD HEARD WHAT THE PHILISTINES HAD DONE TO SAUL ALL THE VALIANT MEN AROSE AND WENT ALL NIGHT AND TOOK THE BODY OF SAUL AND THE BODIES OF HIS SONS FROM THE WALL OF BETHSHAN AND THEY CAME TO JABESH AND BURNED THEM THERE

AND THEY TOOK THEIR BONES AND BURIED THEM UNDER THE TAMARISK TREE IN JABESH AND FASTED SEVEN DAYS

JOSHUAAFTER THE DEATH OF MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN MOSES' ASSISTANT MOSES MY SERVANT IS DEAD

NOW THEREFORE ARISE GO OVER THIS JORDAN YOU AND ALL THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND THAT I AM GIVING TO THEM TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

EVERY PLACE THAT THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT WILL TREAD UPON I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU JUST AS I PROMISED TO MOSES

FROM THE WILDERNESS AND THIS LEBANON AS FAR AS THE GREAT RIVER THE RIVER EUPHRATES ALL THE LAND OF THE HITTITES TO THE GREAT SEA TOWARD THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN SHALL BE YOUR TERRITORY

NO MAN SHALL BE ABLE TO STAND BEFORE YOU ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE

JUST AS I WAS WITH MOSES SO I WILL BE WITH YOU

I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU OR FORSAKE YOU

BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS FOR YOU SHALL CAUSE THIS PEOPLE TO INHERIT THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO THEIR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM

ONLY BE STRONG AND VERY COURAGEOUS BEING CAREFUL TO DO ACCORDING TO ALL THE LAW THAT MOSES MY SERVANT COMMANDED YOU

DO NOT TURN FROM IT TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT THAT YOU MAY HAVE GOOD SUCCESS WHEREVER YOU GO

THIS BOOK OF THE LAW SHALL NOT DEPART FROM YOUR MOUTH BUT YOU SHALL MEDITATE ON IT DAY AND NIGHT SO THAT YOU MAY BE CAREFUL TO DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN IT

FOR THEN YOU WILL MAKE YOUR WAY PROSPEROUS AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD SUCCESS

HAVE I NOT COMMANDED YOU

BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED AND DO NOT BE DISMAYED FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO

 AND JOSHUA COMMANDED THE OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE PASS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE CAMP AND COMMAND THE PEOPLE 'PREPARE YOUR PROVISIONS FOR WITHIN THREE DAYS YOU ARE TO PASS OVER THIS JORDAN TO GO IN TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU TO POSSESS

' AND TO THE REUBENITES THE GADITES AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH JOSHUA SAID REMEMBER THE WORD THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD COMMANDED YOU SAYING 'THE LORD YOUR GOD IS PROVIDING YOU A PLACE OF REST AND WILL GIVE YOU THIS LAND

' YOUR WIVES YOUR LITTLE ONES AND YOUR LIVESTOCK SHALL REMAIN IN THE LAND THAT MOSES GAVE YOU BEYOND THE JORDAN BUT ALL THE MEN OF VALOR AMONG YOU SHALL PASS OVER ARMED BEFORE YOUR BROTHERS AND SHALL HELP THEM UNTIL THE LORD GIVES REST TO YOUR BROTHERS AS HE HAS TO YOU AND THEY ALSO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING THEM

THEN YOU SHALL RETURN TO THE LAND OF YOUR POSSESSION AND SHALL POSSESS IT THE LAND THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD GAVE YOU BEYOND THE JORDAN TOWARD THE SUNRISE

 AND THEY ANSWERED JOSHUA ALL THAT YOU HAVE COMMANDED US WE WILL DO AND WHEREVER YOU SEND US WE WILL GO

JUST AS WE OBEYED MOSES IN ALL THINGS SO WE WILL OBEY YOU

ONLY MAY THE LORD YOUR GOD BE WITH YOU AS HE WAS WITH MOSES

WHOEVER REBELS AGAINST YOUR COMMANDMENT AND DISOBEYS YOUR WORDS WHATEVER YOU COMMAND HIM SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

ONLY BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN SENT TWO MEN SECRETLY FROM SHITTIM AS SPIES SAYING GO VIEW THE LAND ESPECIALLY JERICHO

 AND THEY WENT AND CAME INTO THE HOUSE OF A PROSTITUTE WHOSE NAME WAS RAHAB AND LODGED THERE

AND IT WAS TOLD TO THE KING OF JERICHO BEHOLD MEN OF ISRAEL HAVE COME HERE TONIGHT TO SEARCH OUT THE LAND

 THEN THE KING OF JERICHO SENT TO RAHAB SAYING BRING OUT THE MEN WHO HAVE COME TO YOU WHO ENTERED YOUR HOUSE FOR THEY HAVE COME TO SEARCH OUT ALL THE LAND

 BUT THE WOMAN HAD TAKEN THE TWO MEN AND HIDDEN THEM

AND SHE SAID TRUE THE MEN CAME TO ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE FROM

AND WHEN THE GATE WAS ABOUT TO BE CLOSED AT DARK THE MEN WENT OUT

I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE MEN WENT

PURSUE THEM QUICKLY FOR YOU WILL OVERTAKE THEM

 BUT SHE HAD BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE ROOF AND HID THEM WITH THE STALKS OF FLAX THAT SHE HAD LAID IN ORDER ON THE ROOF

SO THE MEN PURSUED AFTER THEM ON THE WAY TO THE JORDAN AS FAR AS THE FORDS

AND THE GATE WAS SHUT AS SOON AS THE PURSUERS HAD GONE OUT

BEFORE THE MEN LAY DOWN SHE CAME UP TO THEM ON THE ROOF AND SAID TO THE MEN I KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE LAND AND THAT THE FEAR OF YOU HAS FALLEN UPON US AND THAT ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND MELT AWAY BEFORE YOU

FOR WE HAVE HEARD HOW THE LORD DRIED UP THE WATER OF THE RED SEA BEFORE YOU WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF EGYPT AND WHAT YOU DID TO THE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN TO SIHON AND OG WHOM YOU DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION

AND AS SOON AS WE HEARD IT OUR HEARTS MELTED AND THERE WAS NO SPIRIT LEFT IN ANY MAN BECAUSE OF YOU FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD HE IS GOD IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND ON THE EARTH BENEATH

NOW THEN PLEASE SWEAR TO ME BY THE LORD THAT AS I HAVE DEALT KINDLY WITH YOU YOU ALSO WILL DEAL KINDLY WITH MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND GIVE ME A SURE SIGN THAT YOU WILL SAVE ALIVE MY FATHER AND MOTHER MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL WHO BELONG TO THEM AND DELIVER OUR LIVES FROM DEATH

 AND THE MEN SAID TO HER OUR LIFE FOR YOURS EVEN TO DEATH

IF YOU DO NOT TELL THIS BUSINESS OF OURS THEN WHEN THE LORD GIVES US THE LAND WE WILL DEAL KINDLY AND FAITHFULLY WITH YOU

 THEN SHE LET THEM DOWN BY A ROPE THROUGH THE WINDOW FOR HER HOUSE WAS BUILT INTO THE CITY WALL SO THAT SHE LIVED IN THE WALL

AND SHE SAID TO THEM GO INTO THE HILLS OR THE PURSUERS WILL ENCOUNTER YOU AND HIDE THERE THREE DAYS UNTIL THE PURSUERS HAVE RETURNED

THEN AFTERWARD YOU MAY GO YOUR WAY

 THE MEN SAID TO HER WE WILL BE GUILTLESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS OATH OF YOURS THAT YOU HAVE MADE US SWEAR

BEHOLD WHEN WE COME INTO THE LAND YOU SHALL TIE THIS SCARLET CORD IN THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH YOU LET US DOWN AND YOU SHALL GATHER INTO YOUR HOUSE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER YOUR BROTHERS AND ALL YOUR FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD

THEN IF ANYONE GOES OUT OF THE DOORS OF YOUR HOUSE INTO THE STREET HIS BLOOD SHALL BE ON HIS OWN HEAD AND WE SHALL BE GUILTLESS

BUT IF A HAND IS LAID ON ANYONE WHO IS WITH YOU IN THE HOUSE HIS BLOOD SHALL BE ON OUR HEAD

BUT IF YOU TELL THIS BUSINESS OF OURS THEN WE SHALL BE GUILTLESS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR OATH THAT YOU HAVE MADE US SWEAR

 AND SHE SAID ACCORDING TO YOUR WORDS SO BE IT

 THEN SHE SENT THEM AWAY AND THEY DEPARTED

AND SHE TIED THE SCARLET CORD IN THE WINDOW

THEY DEPARTED AND WENT INTO THE HILLS AND REMAINED THERE THREE DAYS UNTIL THE PURSUERS RETURNED AND THE PURSUERS SEARCHED ALL ALONG THE WAY AND FOUND NOTHING

THEN THE TWO MEN RETURNED

THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE HILLS AND PASSED OVER AND CAME TO JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND THEY TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM

AND THEY SAID TO JOSHUA TRULY THE LORD HAS GIVEN ALL THE LAND INTO OUR HANDS

AND ALSO ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND MELT AWAY BECAUSE OF US

THEN JOSHUA ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THEY SET OUT FROM SHITTIM

AND THEY CAME TO THE JORDAN HE AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND LODGED THERE BEFORE THEY PASSED OVER

AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THE OFFICERS WENT THROUGH THE CAMP AND COMMANDED THE PEOPLE AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD BEING CARRIED BY THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS THEN YOU SHALL SET OUT FROM YOUR PLACE AND FOLLOW IT

YET THERE SHALL BE A DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND IT ABOUT  CUBITS IN LENGTH

DO NOT COME NEAR IT IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE WAY YOU SHALL GO FOR YOU HAVE NOT PASSED THIS WAY BEFORE

 THEN JOSHUA SAID TO THE PEOPLE CONSECRATE YOURSELVES FOR TOMORROW THE LORD WILL DO WONDERS AMONG YOU

 AND JOSHUA SAID TO THE PRIESTS TAKE UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT AND PASS ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE

 SO THEY TOOK UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT AND WENT BEFORE THE PEOPLE

THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA TODAY I WILL BEGIN TO EXALT YOU IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT AS I WAS WITH MOSES SO I WILL BE WITH YOU

AND AS FOR YOU COMMAND THE PRIESTS WHO BEAR THE ARK OF THE COVENANT 'WHEN YOU COME TO THE BRINK OF THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN YOU SHALL STAND STILL IN THE JORDAN

' AND JOSHUA SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL COME HERE AND LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

 AND JOSHUA SAID HERE IS HOW YOU SHALL KNOW THAT THE LIVING GOD IS AMONG YOU AND THAT HE WILL WITHOUT FAIL DRIVE OUT FROM BEFORE YOU THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE HIVITES THE PERIZZITES THE GIRGASHITES THE AMORITES AND THE JEBUSITES

BEHOLD THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD OF ALL THE EARTH IS PASSING OVER BEFORE YOU INTO THE JORDAN

NOW THEREFORE TAKE TWELVE MEN FROM THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL FROM EACH TRIBE A MAN

AND WHEN THE SOLES OF THE FEET OF THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE LORD THE LORD OF ALL THE EARTH SHALL REST IN THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM FLOWING AND THE WATERS COMING DOWN FROM ABOVE SHALL STAND IN ONE HEAP

 SO WHEN THE PEOPLE SET OUT FROM THEIR TENTS TO PASS OVER THE JORDAN WITH THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT BEFORE THE PEOPLE AND AS SOON AS THOSE BEARING THE ARK HAD COME AS FAR AS THE JORDAN AND THE FEET OF THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK WERE DIPPED IN THE BRINK OF THE WATER NOW THE JORDAN OVERFLOWS ALL ITS BANKS THROUGHOUT THE TIME OF HARVEST THE WATERS COMING DOWN FROM ABOVE STOOD AND ROSE UP IN A HEAP VERY FAR AWAY AT ADAM THE CITY THAT IS BESIDE ZARETHAN AND THOSE FLOWING DOWN TOWARD THE SEA OF THE ARABAH THE SALT SEA WERE COMPLETELY CUT OFF

AND THE PEOPLE PASSED OVER OPPOSITE JERICHO

NOW THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD STOOD FIRMLY ON DRY GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN AND ALL ISRAEL WAS PASSING OVER ON DRY GROUND UNTIL ALL THE NATION FINISHED PASSING OVER THE JORDAN

WHEN ALL THE NATION HAD FINISHED PASSING OVER THE JORDAN THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA TAKE TWELVE MEN FROM THE PEOPLE FROM EACH TRIBE A MAN AND COMMAND THEM SAYING 'TAKE TWELVE STONES FROM HERE OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN FROM THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE PRIESTS' FEET STOOD FIRMLY AND BRING THEM OVER WITH YOU AND LAY THEM DOWN IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU LODGE TONIGHT

' THEN JOSHUA CALLED THE TWELVE MEN FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHOM HE HAD APPOINTED A MAN FROM EACH TRIBE

AND JOSHUA SAID TO THEM PASS ON BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD YOUR GOD INTO THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN AND TAKE UP EACH OF YOU A STONE UPON HIS SHOULDER ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT THIS MAY BE A SIGN AMONG YOU

WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ASK IN TIME TO COME 'WHAT DO THOSE STONES MEAN TO YOU

' THEN YOU SHALL TELL THEM THAT THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN WERE CUT OFF BEFORE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD

WHEN IT PASSED OVER THE JORDAN THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN WERE CUT OFF

SO THESE STONES SHALL BE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL A MEMORIAL FOREVER

 AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID JUST AS JOSHUA COMMANDED AND TOOK UP TWELVE STONES OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL JUST AS THE LORD TOLD JOSHUA

AND THEY CARRIED THEM OVER WITH THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY LODGED AND LAID THEM DOWN THERE

AND JOSHUA SET UP TWELVE STONES IN THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN IN THE PLACE WHERE THE FEET OF THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT HAD STOOD; AND THEY ARE THERE TO THIS DAY

FOR THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN UNTIL EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED THAT THE LORD COMMANDED JOSHUA TO TELL THE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO ALL THAT MOSES HAD COMMANDED JOSHUA

THE PEOPLE PASSED OVER IN HASTE

AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE HAD FINISHED PASSING OVER THE ARK OF THE LORD AND THE PRIESTS PASSED OVER BEFORE THE PEOPLE

THE SONS OF REUBEN AND THE SONS OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH PASSED OVER ARMED BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AS MOSES HAD TOLD THEM

ABOUT  READY FOR WAR PASSED OVER BEFORE THE LORD FOR BATTLE TO THE PLAINS OF JERICHO

ON THAT DAY THE LORD EXALTED JOSHUA IN THE SIGHT OF ALL ISRAEL AND THEY STOOD IN AWE OF HIM JUST AS THEY HAD STOOD IN AWE OF MOSES ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA COMMAND THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY TO COME UP OUT OF THE JORDAN

 SO JOSHUA COMMANDED THE PRIESTS COME UP OUT OF THE JORDAN

 AND WHEN THE PRIESTS BEARING THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD CAME UP FROM THE MIDST OF THE JORDAN AND THE SOLES OF THE PRIESTS' FEET WERE LIFTED UP ON DRY GROUND THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN RETURNED TO THEIR PLACE AND OVERFLOWED ALL ITS BANKS AS BEFORE

THE PEOPLE CAME UP OUT OF THE JORDAN ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH AND THEY ENCAMPED AT GILGAL ON THE EAST BORDER OF JERICHO

AND THOSE TWELVE STONES WHICH THEY TOOK OUT OF THE JORDAN JOSHUA SET UP AT GILGAL

AND HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ASK THEIR FATHERS IN TIMES TO COME 'WHAT DO THESE STONES MEAN

' THEN YOU SHALL LET YOUR CHILDREN KNOW 'ISRAEL PASSED OVER THIS JORDAN ON DRY GROUND

' FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD DRIED UP THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN FOR YOU UNTIL YOU PASSED OVER AS THE LORD YOUR GOD DID TO THE RED SEA WHICH HE DRIED UP FOR US UNTIL WE PASSED OVER SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW THAT THE HAND OF THE LORD IS MIGHTY THAT YOU MAY FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD FOREVER

AS SOON AS ALL THE KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN TO THE WEST AND ALL THE KINGS OF THE CANAANITES WHO WERE BY THE SEA HEARD THAT THE LORD HAD DRIED UP THE WATERS OF THE JORDAN FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL UNTIL THEY HAD CROSSED OVER THEIR HEARTS MELTED AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY SPIRIT IN THEM BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AT THAT TIME THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA MAKE FLINT KNIVES AND CIRCUMCISE THE SONS OF ISRAEL A SECOND TIME

 SO JOSHUA MADE FLINT KNIVES AND CIRCUMCISED THE SONS OF ISRAEL AT GIBEATHHAARALOTH

AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY JOSHUA CIRCUMCISED THEM ALL THE MALES OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF EGYPT ALL THE MEN OF WAR HAD DIED IN THE WILDERNESS ON THE WAY AFTER THEY HAD COME OUT OF EGYPT

THOUGH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT HAD BEEN CIRCUMCISED YET ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN ON THE WAY IN THE WILDERNESS AFTER THEY HAD COME OUT OF EGYPT HAD NOT BEEN CIRCUMCISED

FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WALKED FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS UNTIL ALL THE NATION THE MEN OF WAR WHO CAME OUT OF EGYPT PERISHED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD; THE LORD SWORE TO THEM THAT HE WOULD NOT LET THEM SEE THE LAND THAT THE LORD HAD SWORN TO THEIR FATHERS TO GIVE TO US A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY

SO IT WAS THEIR CHILDREN WHOM HE RAISED UP IN THEIR PLACE THAT JOSHUA CIRCUMCISED

FOR THEY WERE UNCIRCUMCISED BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN CIRCUMCISED ON THE WAY

WHEN THE CIRCUMCISING OF THE WHOLE NATION WAS FINISHED THEY REMAINED IN THEIR PLACES IN THE CAMP UNTIL THEY WERE HEALED

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA TODAY I HAVE ROLLED AWAY THE REPROACH OF EGYPT FROM YOU

 AND SO THE NAME OF THAT PLACE IS CALLED GILGAL TO THIS DAY

WHILE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE ENCAMPED AT GILGAL THEY KEPT THE PASSOVER ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH IN THE EVENING ON THE PLAINS OF JERICHO

AND THE DAY AFTER THE PASSOVER ON THAT VERY DAY THEY ATE OF THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND UNLEAVENED CAKES AND PARCHED GRAIN

AND THE MANNA CEASED THE DAY AFTER THEY ATE OF THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND

AND THERE WAS NO LONGER MANNA FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BUT THEY ATE OF THE FRUIT OF THE LAND OF CANAAN THAT YEAR

WHEN JOSHUA WAS BY JERICHO HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND LOOKED AND BEHOLD A MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM WITH HIS DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND

AND JOSHUA WENT TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM ARE YOU FOR US OR FOR OUR ADVERSARIES

 AND HE SAID NO; BUT I AM THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE LORD

NOW I HAVE COME

 AND JOSHUA FELL ON HIS FACE TO THE EARTH AND WORSHIPED AND SAID TO HIM WHAT DOES MY LORD SAY TO HIS SERVANT

 AND THE COMMANDER OF THE LORD'S ARMY SAID TO JOSHUA TAKE OFF YOUR SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET FOR THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY

 AND JOSHUA DID SO

NOW JERICHO WAS SHUT UP INSIDE AND OUTSIDE BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

NONE WENT OUT AND NONE CAME IN

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA SEE I HAVE GIVEN JERICHO INTO YOUR HAND WITH ITS KING AND MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR

YOU SHALL MARCH AROUND THE CITY ALL THE MEN OF WAR GOING AROUND THE CITY ONCE

THUS SHALL YOU DO FOR SIX DAYS

SEVEN PRIESTS SHALL BEAR SEVEN TRUMPETS OF RAMS' HORNS BEFORE THE ARK

ON THE SEVENTH DAY YOU SHALL MARCH AROUND THE CITY SEVEN TIMES AND THE PRIESTS SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS

AND WHEN THEY MAKE A LONG BLAST WITH THE RAM'S HORN WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THEN ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL SHOUT WITH A GREAT SHOUT AND THE WALL OF THE CITY WILL FALL DOWN FLAT AND THE PEOPLE SHALL GO UP EVERYONE STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM

 SO JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN CALLED THE PRIESTS AND SAID TO THEM TAKE UP THE ARK OF THE COVENANT AND LET SEVEN PRIESTS BEAR SEVEN TRUMPETS OF RAMS' HORNS BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD

 AND HE SAID TO THE PEOPLE GO FORWARD

MARCH AROUND THE CITY AND LET THE ARMED MEN PASS ON BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD

 AND JUST AS JOSHUA HAD COMMANDED THE PEOPLE THE SEVEN PRIESTS BEARING THE SEVEN TRUMPETS OF RAMS' HORNS BEFORE THE LORD WENT FORWARD BLOWING THE TRUMPETS WITH THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD FOLLOWING THEM

THE ARMED MEN WERE WALKING BEFORE THE PRIESTS WHO WERE BLOWING THE TRUMPETS AND THE REAR GUARD WAS WALKING AFTER THE ARK WHILE THE TRUMPETS BLEW CONTINUALLY

BUT JOSHUA COMMANDED THE PEOPLE YOU SHALL NOT SHOUT OR MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD NEITHER SHALL ANY WORD GO OUT OF YOUR MOUTH UNTIL THE DAY I TELL YOU TO SHOUT

THEN YOU SHALL SHOUT

 SO HE CAUSED THE ARK OF THE LORD TO CIRCLE THE CITY GOING ABOUT IT ONCE

AND THEY CAME INTO THE CAMP AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE CAMP

THEN JOSHUA ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THE PRIESTS TOOK UP THE ARK OF THE LORD

AND THE SEVEN PRIESTS BEARING THE SEVEN TRUMPETS OF RAMS' HORNS BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD WALKED ON AND THEY BLEW THE TRUMPETS CONTINUALLY

AND THE ARMED MEN WERE WALKING BEFORE THEM AND THE REAR GUARD WAS WALKING AFTER THE ARK OF THE LORD WHILE THE TRUMPETS BLEW CONTINUALLY

AND THE SECOND DAY THEY MARCHED AROUND THE CITY ONCE AND RETURNED INTO THE CAMP

SO THEY DID FOR SIX DAYS

ON THE SEVENTH DAY THEY ROSE EARLY AT THE DAWN OF DAY AND MARCHED AROUND THE CITY IN THE SAME MANNER SEVEN TIMES

IT WAS ONLY ON THAT DAY THAT THEY MARCHED AROUND THE CITY SEVEN TIMES

AND AT THE SEVENTH TIME WHEN THE PRIESTS HAD BLOWN THE TRUMPETS JOSHUA SAID TO THE PEOPLE SHOUT FOR THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE CITY

AND THE CITY AND ALL THAT IS WITHIN IT SHALL BE DEVOTED TO THE LORD FOR DESTRUCTION

ONLY RAHAB THE PROSTITUTE AND ALL WHO ARE WITH HER IN HER HOUSE SHALL LIVE BECAUSE SHE HID THE MESSENGERS WHOM WE SENT

BUT YOU KEEP YOURSELVES FROM THE THINGS DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION LEST WHEN YOU HAVE DEVOTED THEM YOU TAKE ANY OF THE DEVOTED THINGS AND MAKE THE CAMP OF ISRAEL A THING FOR DESTRUCTION AND BRING TROUBLE UPON IT

BUT ALL SILVER AND GOLD AND EVERY VESSEL OF BRONZE AND IRON ARE HOLY TO THE LORD; THEY SHALL GO INTO THE TREASURY OF THE LORD

 SO THE PEOPLE SHOUTED AND THE TRUMPETS WERE BLOWN

AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THE PEOPLE SHOUTED A GREAT SHOUT AND THE WALL FELL DOWN FLAT SO THAT THE PEOPLE WENT UP INTO THE CITY EVERY MAN STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND THEY CAPTURED THE CITY

THEN THEY DEVOTED ALL IN THE CITY TO DESTRUCTION BOTH MEN AND WOMEN YOUNG AND OLD OXEN SHEEP AND DONKEYS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

BUT TO THE TWO MEN WHO HAD SPIED OUT THE LAND JOSHUA SAID GO INTO THE PROSTITUTE'S HOUSE AND BRING OUT FROM THERE THE WOMAN AND ALL WHO BELONG TO HER AS YOU SWORE TO HER

 SO THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN SPIES WENT IN AND BROUGHT OUT RAHAB AND HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND ALL WHO BELONGED TO HER

AND THEY BROUGHT ALL HER RELATIVES AND PUT THEM OUTSIDE THE CAMP OF ISRAEL

AND THEY BURNED THE CITY WITH FIRE AND EVERYTHING IN IT

ONLY THE SILVER AND GOLD AND THE VESSELS OF BRONZE AND OF IRON THEY PUT INTO THE TREASURY OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

BUT RAHAB THE PROSTITUTE AND HER FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD AND ALL WHO BELONGED TO HER JOSHUA SAVED ALIVE

AND SHE HAS LIVED IN ISRAEL TO THIS DAY BECAUSE SHE HID THE MESSENGERS WHOM JOSHUA SENT TO SPY OUT JERICHO

JOSHUA LAID AN OATH ON THEM AT THAT TIME SAYING CURSED BEFORE THE LORD BE THE MAN WHO RISES UP AND REBUILDS THIS CITY JERICHO

AT THE COST OF HIS FIRSTBORN SHALL HE LAY ITS FOUNDATION AND AT THE COST OF HIS YOUNGEST SON SHALL HE SET UP ITS GATES

 SO THE LORD WAS WITH JOSHUA AND HIS FAME WAS IN ALL THE LAND

BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BROKE FAITH IN REGARD TO THE DEVOTED THINGS FOR ACHAN THE SON OF CARMI SON OF ZABDI SON OF ZERAH OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH TOOK SOME OF THE DEVOTED THINGS

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD BURNED AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

JOSHUA SENT MEN FROM JERICHO TO AI WHICH IS NEAR BETHAVEN EAST OF BETHEL AND SAID TO THEM GO UP AND SPY OUT THE LAND

 AND THE MEN WENT UP AND SPIED OUT AI

AND THEY RETURNED TO JOSHUA AND SAID TO HIM DO NOT HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE GO UP BUT LET ABOUT TWO OR THREE THOUSAND MEN GO UP AND ATTACK AI

DO NOT MAKE THE WHOLE PEOPLE TOIL UP THERE FOR THEY ARE FEW

 SO ABOUT  MEN WENT UP THERE FROM THE PEOPLE

AND THEY FLED BEFORE THE MEN OF AI AND THE MEN OF AI KILLED ABOUT THIRTYSIX OF THEIR MEN AND CHASED THEM BEFORE THE GATE AS FAR AS SHEBARIM AND STRUCK THEM AT THE DESCENT

AND THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE MELTED AND BECAME AS WATER

THEN JOSHUA TORE HIS CLOTHES AND FELL TO THE EARTH ON HIS FACE BEFORE THE ARK OF THE LORD UNTIL THE EVENING HE AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL

AND THEY PUT DUST ON THEIR HEADS

AND JOSHUA SAID ALAS O LORD GOD WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT THIS PEOPLE OVER THE JORDAN AT ALL TO GIVE US INTO THE HANDS OF THE AMORITES TO DESTROY US

WOULD THAT WE HAD BEEN CONTENT TO DWELL BEYOND THE JORDAN

O LORD WHAT CAN I SAY WHEN ISRAEL HAS TURNED THEIR BACKS BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES

FOR THE CANAANITES AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND WILL HEAR OF IT AND WILL SURROUND US AND CUT OFF OUR NAME FROM THE EARTH

AND WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR YOUR GREAT NAME

 THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA GET UP

WHY HAVE YOU FALLEN ON YOUR FACE

ISRAEL HAS SINNED; THEY HAVE TRANSGRESSED MY COVENANT THAT I COMMANDED THEM; THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE DEVOTED THINGS; THEY HAVE STOLEN AND LIED AND PUT THEM AMONG THEIR OWN BELONGINGS

THEREFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CANNOT STAND BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES

THEY TURN THEIR BACKS BEFORE THEIR ENEMIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME DEVOTED FOR DESTRUCTION

I WILL BE WITH YOU NO MORE UNLESS YOU DESTROY THE DEVOTED THINGS FROM AMONG YOU

GET UP

CONSECRATE THE PEOPLE AND SAY 'CONSECRATE YOURSELVES FOR TOMORROW; FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL THERE ARE DEVOTED THINGS IN YOUR MIDST O ISRAEL

YOU CANNOT STAND BEFORE YOUR ENEMIES UNTIL YOU TAKE AWAY THE DEVOTED THINGS FROM AMONG YOU

 IN THE MORNING THEREFORE YOU SHALL BE BROUGHT NEAR BY YOUR TRIBES

AND THE TRIBE THAT THE LORD TAKES BY LOT SHALL COME NEAR BY CLANS

AND THE CLAN THAT THE LORD TAKES SHALL COME NEAR BY HOUSEHOLDS

AND THE HOUSEHOLD THAT THE LORD TAKES SHALL COME NEAR MAN BY MAN

AND HE WHO IS TAKEN WITH THE DEVOTED THINGS SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE HE AND ALL THAT HE HAS BECAUSE HE HAS TRANSGRESSED THE COVENANT OF THE LORD AND BECAUSE HE HAS DONE AN OUTRAGEOUS THING IN ISRAEL

' SO JOSHUA ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND BROUGHT ISRAEL NEAR TRIBE BY TRIBE AND THE TRIBE OF JUDAH WAS TAKEN

AND HE BROUGHT NEAR THE CLANS OF JUDAH AND THE CLAN OF THE ZERAHITES WAS TAKEN

AND HE BROUGHT NEAR THE CLAN OF THE ZERAHITES MAN BY MAN AND ZABDI WAS TAKEN

AND HE BROUGHT NEAR HIS HOUSEHOLD MAN BY MAN AND ACHAN THE SON OF CARMI SON OF ZABDI SON OF ZERAH OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH WAS TAKEN

THEN JOSHUA SAID TO ACHAN MY SON GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND GIVE PRAISE TO HIM

AND TELL ME NOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE; DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME

 AND ACHAN ANSWERED JOSHUA TRULY I HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND THIS IS WHAT I DID WHEN I SAW AMONG THE SPOIL A BEAUTIFUL CLOAK FROM SHINAR AND  SHEKELS OF SILVER AND A BAR OF GOLD WEIGHING  SHEKELS THEN I COVETED THEM AND TOOK THEM

AND SEE THEY ARE HIDDEN IN THE EARTH INSIDE MY TENT WITH THE SILVER UNDERNEATH

 SO JOSHUA SENT MESSENGERS AND THEY RAN TO THE TENT; AND BEHOLD IT WAS HIDDEN IN HIS TENT WITH THE SILVER UNDERNEATH

AND THEY TOOK THEM OUT OF THE TENT AND BROUGHT THEM TO JOSHUA AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THEY LAID THEM DOWN BEFORE THE LORD

AND JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM TOOK ACHAN THE SON OF ZERAH AND THE SILVER AND THE CLOAK AND THE BAR OF GOLD AND HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND HIS OXEN AND DONKEYS AND SHEEP AND HIS TENT AND ALL THAT HE HAD

AND THEY BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE VALLEY OF ACHOR

AND JOSHUA SAID WHY DID YOU BRING TROUBLE ON US

THE LORD BRINGS TROUBLE ON YOU TODAY

 AND ALL ISRAEL STONED HIM WITH STONES

THEY BURNED THEM WITH FIRE AND STONED THEM WITH STONES

AND THEY RAISED OVER HIM A GREAT HEAP OF STONES THAT REMAINS TO THIS DAY

THEN THE LORD TURNED FROM HIS BURNING ANGER

THEREFORE TO THIS DAY THE NAME OF THAT PLACE IS CALLED THE VALLEY OF ACHOR

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA DO NOT FEAR AND DO NOT BE DISMAYED

TAKE ALL THE FIGHTING MEN WITH YOU AND ARISE GO UP TO AI

SEE I HAVE GIVEN INTO YOUR HAND THE KING OF AI AND HIS PEOPLE HIS CITY AND HIS LAND

AND YOU SHALL DO TO AI AND ITS KING AS YOU DID TO JERICHO AND ITS KING

ONLY ITS SPOIL AND ITS LIVESTOCK YOU SHALL TAKE AS PLUNDER FOR YOURSELVES

LAY AN AMBUSH AGAINST THE CITY BEHIND IT

 SO JOSHUA AND ALL THE FIGHTING MEN AROSE TO GO UP TO AI

AND JOSHUA CHOSE  MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR AND SENT THEM OUT BY NIGHT

AND HE COMMANDED THEM BEHOLD YOU SHALL LIE IN AMBUSH AGAINST THE CITY BEHIND IT

DO NOT GO VERY FAR FROM THE CITY BUT ALL OF YOU REMAIN READY

AND I AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH ME WILL APPROACH THE CITY

AND WHEN THEY COME OUT AGAINST US JUST AS BEFORE WE SHALL FLEE BEFORE THEM

AND THEY WILL COME OUT AFTER US UNTIL WE HAVE DRAWN THEM AWAY FROM THE CITY

FOR THEY WILL SAY 'THEY ARE FLEEING FROM US JUST AS BEFORE

' SO WE WILL FLEE BEFORE THEM

THEN YOU SHALL RISE UP FROM THE AMBUSH AND SEIZE THE CITY FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL GIVE IT INTO YOUR HAND

AND AS SOON AS YOU HAVE TAKEN THE CITY YOU SHALL SET THE CITY ON FIRE

YOU SHALL DO ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

SEE I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

 SO JOSHUA SENT THEM OUT

AND THEY WENT TO THE PLACE OF AMBUSH AND LAY BETWEEN BETHEL AND AI TO THE WEST OF AI BUT JOSHUA SPENT THAT NIGHT AMONG THE PEOPLE

JOSHUA AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND MUSTERED THE PEOPLE AND WENT UP HE AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL BEFORE THE PEOPLE TO AI

AND ALL THE FIGHTING MEN WHO WERE WITH HIM WENT UP AND DREW NEAR BEFORE THE CITY AND ENCAMPED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF AI WITH A RAVINE BETWEEN THEM AND AI

HE TOOK ABOUT  MEN AND SET THEM IN AMBUSH BETWEEN BETHEL AND AI TO THE WEST OF THE CITY

SO THEY STATIONED THE FORCES THE MAIN ENCAMPMENT THAT WAS NORTH OF THE CITY AND ITS REAR GUARD WEST OF THE CITY

BUT JOSHUA SPENT THAT NIGHT IN THE VALLEY

AND AS SOON AS THE KING OF AI SAW THIS HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE THE MEN OF THE CITY HURRIED AND WENT OUT EARLY TO THE APPOINTED PLACE TOWARD THE ARABAH TO MEET ISRAEL IN BATTLE

BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN AMBUSH AGAINST HIM BEHIND THE CITY

AND JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL PRETENDED TO BE BEATEN BEFORE THEM AND FLED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WILDERNESS

SO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE CITY WERE CALLED TOGETHER TO PURSUE THEM AND AS THEY PURSUED JOSHUA THEY WERE DRAWN AWAY FROM THE CITY

NOT A MAN WAS LEFT IN AI OR BETHEL WHO DID NOT GO OUT AFTER ISRAEL

THEY LEFT THE CITY OPEN AND PURSUED ISRAEL

THEN THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA STRETCH OUT THE JAVELIN THAT IS IN YOUR HAND TOWARD AI FOR I WILL GIVE IT INTO YOUR HAND

 AND JOSHUA STRETCHED OUT THE JAVELIN THAT WAS IN HIS HAND TOWARD THE CITY

AND THE MEN IN THE AMBUSH ROSE QUICKLY OUT OF THEIR PLACE AND AS SOON AS HE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND THEY RAN AND ENTERED THE CITY AND CAPTURED IT

AND THEY HURRIED TO SET THE CITY ON FIRE

SO WHEN THE MEN OF AI LOOKED BACK BEHOLD THE SMOKE OF THE CITY WENT UP TO HEAVEN AND THEY HAD NO POWER TO FLEE THIS WAY OR THAT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FLED TO THE WILDERNESS TURNED BACK AGAINST THE PURSUERS

AND WHEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL SAW THAT THE AMBUSH HAD CAPTURED THE CITY AND THAT THE SMOKE OF THE CITY WENT UP THEN THEY TURNED BACK AND STRUCK DOWN THE MEN OF AI

AND THE OTHERS CAME OUT FROM THE CITY AGAINST THEM SO THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF ISRAEL SOME ON THIS SIDE AND SOME ON THAT SIDE

AND ISRAEL STRUCK THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS LEFT NONE THAT SURVIVED OR ESCAPED

BUT THE KING OF AI THEY TOOK ALIVE AND BROUGHT HIM NEAR TO JOSHUA

WHEN ISRAEL HAD FINISHED KILLING ALL THE INHABITANTS OF AI IN THE OPEN WILDERNESS WHERE THEY PURSUED THEM AND ALL OF THEM TO THE VERY LAST HAD FALLEN BY THE EDGE OF THE SWORD ALL ISRAEL RETURNED TO AI AND STRUCK IT DOWN WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

AND ALL WHO FELL THAT DAY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WERE  ALL THE PEOPLE OF AI

BUT JOSHUA DID NOT DRAW BACK HIS HAND WITH WHICH HE STRETCHED OUT THE JAVELIN UNTIL HE HAD DEVOTED ALL THE INHABITANTS OF AI TO DESTRUCTION

ONLY THE LIVESTOCK AND THE SPOIL OF THAT CITY ISRAEL TOOK AS THEIR PLUNDER ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE COMMANDED JOSHUA

SO JOSHUA BURNED AI AND MADE IT FOREVER A HEAP OF RUINS AS IT IS TO THIS DAY

AND HE HANGED THE KING OF AI ON A TREE UNTIL EVENING

AND AT SUNSET JOSHUA COMMANDED AND THEY TOOK HIS BODY DOWN FROM THE TREE AND THREW IT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF THE CITY AND RAISED OVER IT A GREAT HEAP OF STONES WHICH STANDS THERE TO THIS DAY

AT THAT TIME JOSHUA BUILT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL ON MOUNT EBAL JUST AS MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD HAD COMMANDED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF MOSES AN ALTAR OF UNCUT STONES UPON WHICH NO MAN HAS WIELDED AN IRON TOOL

 AND THEY OFFERED ON IT BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD AND SACRIFICED PEACE OFFERINGS

AND THERE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HE WROTE ON THE STONES A COPY OF THE LAW OF MOSES WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN

AND ALL ISRAEL SOJOURNER AS WELL AS NATIVE BORN WITH THEIR ELDERS AND OFFICERS AND THEIR JUDGES STOOD ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ARK BEFORE THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS WHO CARRIED THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD HALF OF THEM IN FRONT OF MOUNT GERIZIM AND HALF OF THEM IN FRONT OF MOUNT EBAL JUST AS MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD HAD COMMANDED AT THE FIRST TO BLESS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND AFTERWARD HE READ ALL THE WORDS OF THE LAW THE BLESSING AND THE CURSE ACCORDING TO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW

THERE WAS NOT A WORD OF ALL THAT MOSES COMMANDED THAT JOSHUA DID NOT READ BEFORE ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF ISRAEL AND THE WOMEN AND THE LITTLE ONES AND THE SOJOURNERS WHO LIVED AMONG THEM

AS SOON AS ALL THE KINGS WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND IN THE LOWLAND ALL ALONG THE COAST OF THE GREAT SEA TOWARD LEBANON THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE CANAANITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES HEARD OF THIS THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AS ONE TO FIGHT AGAINST JOSHUA AND ISRAEL

BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF GIBEON HEARD WHAT JOSHUA HAD DONE TO JERICHO AND TO AI THEY ON THEIR PART ACTED WITH CUNNING AND WENT AND MADE READY PROVISIONS AND TOOK WORNOUT SACKS FOR THEIR DONKEYS AND WINESKINS WORNOUT AND TORN AND MENDED WITH WORNOUT PATCHED SANDALS ON THEIR FEET AND WORNOUT CLOTHES

AND ALL THEIR PROVISIONS WERE DRY AND CRUMBLY

AND THEY WENT TO JOSHUA IN THE CAMP AT GILGAL AND SAID TO HIM AND TO THE MEN OF ISRAEL WE HAVE COME FROM A DISTANT COUNTRY SO NOW MAKE A COVENANT WITH US

 BUT THE MEN OF ISRAEL SAID TO THE HIVITES PERHAPS YOU LIVE AMONG US; THEN HOW CAN WE MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU

 THEY SAID TO JOSHUA WE ARE YOUR SERVANTS

 AND JOSHUA SAID TO THEM WHO ARE YOU

AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM

 THEY SAID TO HIM FROM A VERY DISTANT COUNTRY YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME BECAUSE OF THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

FOR WE HAVE HEARD A REPORT OF HIM AND ALL THAT HE DID IN EGYPT AND ALL THAT HE DID TO THE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO WERE BEYOND THE JORDAN TO SIHON THE KING OF HESHBON AND TO OG KING OF BASHAN WHO LIVED IN ASHTAROTH

SO OUR ELDERS AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF OUR COUNTRY SAID TO US 'TAKE PROVISIONS IN YOUR HAND FOR THE JOURNEY AND GO TO MEET THEM AND SAY TO THEM WE ARE YOUR SERVANTS

COME NOW MAKE A COVENANT WITH US

' HERE IS OUR BREAD

IT WAS STILL WARM WHEN WE TOOK IT FROM OUR HOUSES AS OUR FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY ON THE DAY WE SET OUT TO COME TO YOU BUT NOW BEHOLD IT IS DRY AND CRUMBLY

THESE WINESKINS WERE NEW WHEN WE FILLED THEM AND BEHOLD THEY HAVE BURST

AND THESE GARMENTS AND SANDALS OF OURS ARE WORN OUT FROM THE VERY LONG JOURNEY

 SO THE MEN TOOK SOME OF THEIR PROVISIONS BUT DID NOT ASK COUNSEL FROM THE LORD

AND JOSHUA MADE PEACE WITH THEM AND MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM TO LET THEM LIVE AND THE LEADERS OF THE CONGREGATION SWORE TO THEM

AT THE END OF THREE DAYS AFTER THEY HAD MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM THEY HEARD THAT THEY WERE THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THAT THEY LIVED AMONG THEM

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT AND REACHED THEIR CITIES ON THE THIRD DAY

NOW THEIR CITIES WERE GIBEON CHEPHIRAH BEEROTH AND KIRIATHJEARIM

BUT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID NOT ATTACK THEM BECAUSE THE LEADERS OF THE CONGREGATION HAD SWORN TO THEM BY THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION MURMURED AGAINST THE LEADERS

BUT ALL THE LEADERS SAID TO ALL THE CONGREGATION WE HAVE SWORN TO THEM BY THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL AND NOW WE MAY NOT TOUCH THEM

THIS WE WILL DO TO THEM LET THEM LIVE LEST WRATH BE UPON US BECAUSE OF THE OATH THAT WE SWORE TO THEM

 AND THE LEADERS SAID TO THEM LET THEM LIVE

 SO THEY BECAME CUTTERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS OF WATER FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION JUST AS THE LEADERS HAD SAID OF THEM

JOSHUA SUMMONED THEM AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY DID YOU DECEIVE US SAYING 'WE ARE VERY FAR FROM YOU' WHEN YOU DWELL AMONG US

NOW THEREFORE YOU ARE CURSED AND SOME OF YOU SHALL NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT SERVANTS CUTTERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS OF WATER FOR THE HOUSE OF MY GOD

 THEY ANSWERED JOSHUA BECAUSE IT WAS TOLD TO YOUR SERVANTS FOR A CERTAINTY THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAD COMMANDED HIS SERVANT MOSES TO GIVE YOU ALL THE LAND AND TO DESTROY ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND FROM BEFORE YOUSO WE FEARED GREATLY FOR OUR LIVES BECAUSE OF YOU AND DID THIS THING

AND NOW BEHOLD WE ARE IN YOUR HAND

WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD AND RIGHT IN YOUR SIGHT TO DO TO US DO IT

 SO HE DID THIS TO THEM AND DELIVERED THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THEY DID NOT KILL THEM

BUT JOSHUA MADE THEM THAT DAY CUTTERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS OF WATER FOR THE CONGREGATION AND FOR THE ALTAR OF THE LORD TO THIS DAY IN THE PLACE THAT HE SHOULD CHOOSE

AS SOON AS ADONIZEDEK KING OF JERUSALEM HEARD HOW JOSHUA HAD CAPTURED AI AND HAD DEVOTED IT TO DESTRUCTION DOING TO AI AND ITS KING AS HE HAD DONE TO JERICHO AND ITS KING AND HOW THE INHABITANTS OF GIBEON HAD MADE PEACE WITH ISRAEL AND WERE AMONG THEM HE FEARED GREATLY BECAUSE GIBEON WAS A GREAT CITY LIKE ONE OF THE ROYAL CITIES AND BECAUSE IT WAS GREATER THAN AI AND ALL ITS MEN WERE WARRIORS

SO ADONIZEDEK KING OF JERUSALEM SENT TO HOHAM KING OF HEBRON TO PIRAM KING OF JARMUTH TO JAPHIA KING OF LACHISH AND TO DEBIR KING OF EGLON SAYING COME UP TO ME AND HELP ME AND LET US STRIKE GIBEON

FOR IT HAS MADE PEACE WITH JOSHUA AND WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 THEN THE FIVE KINGS OF THE AMORITES THE KING OF JERUSALEM THE KING OF HEBRON THE KING OF JARMUTH THE KING OF LACHISH AND THE KING OF EGLON GATHERED THEIR FORCES AND WENT UP WITH ALL THEIR ARMIES AND ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBEON AND MADE WAR AGAINST IT

AND THE MEN OF GIBEON SENT TO JOSHUA AT THE CAMP IN GILGAL SAYING DO NOT RELAX YOUR HAND FROM YOUR SERVANTS

COME UP TO US QUICKLY AND SAVE US AND HELP US FOR ALL THE KINGS OF THE AMORITES WHO DWELL IN THE HILL COUNTRY ARE GATHERED AGAINST US

 SO JOSHUA WENT UP FROM GILGAL HE AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF WAR WITH HIM AND ALL THE MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA DO NOT FEAR THEM FOR I HAVE GIVEN THEM INTO YOUR HANDS

NOT A MAN OF THEM SHALL STAND BEFORE YOU

 SO JOSHUA CAME UPON THEM SUDDENLY HAVING MARCHED UP ALL NIGHT FROM GILGAL

AND THE LORD THREW THEM INTO A PANIC BEFORE ISRAEL WHO STRUCK THEM WITH A GREAT BLOW AT GIBEON AND CHASED THEM BY THE WAY OF THE ASCENT OF BETHHORON AND STRUCK THEM AS FAR AS AZEKAH AND MAKKEDAH

AND AS THEY FLED BEFORE ISRAEL WHILE THEY WERE GOING DOWN THE ASCENT OF BETHHORON THE LORD THREW DOWN LARGE STONES FROM HEAVEN ON THEM AS FAR AS AZEKAH AND THEY DIED

THERE WERE MORE WHO DIED BECAUSE OF THE HAILSTONES THAN THE SONS OF ISRAEL KILLED WITH THE SWORD

AT THAT TIME JOSHUA SPOKE TO THE LORD IN THE DAY WHEN THE LORD GAVE THE AMORITES OVER TO THE SONS OF ISRAEL AND HE SAID IN THE SIGHT OF ISRAEL SUN STAND STILL AT GIBEON AND MOON IN THE VALLEY OF AIJALON

 AND THE SUN STOOD STILL AND THE MOON STOPPED UNTIL THE NATION TOOK VENGEANCE ON THEIR ENEMIES

IS THIS NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF JASHAR

THE SUN STOPPED IN THE MIDST OF HEAVEN AND DID NOT HURRY TO SET FOR ABOUT A WHOLE DAY

THERE HAS BEEN NO DAY LIKE IT BEFORE OR SINCE WHEN THE LORD OBEYED THE VOICE OF A MAN FOR THE LORD FOUGHT FOR ISRAEL

SO JOSHUA RETURNED AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM TO THE CAMP AT GILGAL

THESE FIVE KINGS FLED AND HID THEMSELVES IN THE CAVE AT MAKKEDAH

AND IT WAS TOLD TO JOSHUA THE FIVE KINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND HIDDEN IN THE CAVE AT MAKKEDAH

 AND JOSHUA SAID ROLL LARGE STONES AGAINST THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND SET MEN BY IT TO GUARD THEM BUT DO NOT STAY THERE YOURSELVES

PURSUE YOUR ENEMIES; ATTACK THEIR REAR GUARD

DO NOT LET THEM ENTER THEIR CITIES FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS GIVEN THEM INTO YOUR HAND

 WHEN JOSHUA AND THE SONS OF ISRAEL HAD FINISHED STRIKING THEM WITH A GREAT BLOW UNTIL THEY WERE WIPED OUT AND WHEN THE REMNANT THAT REMAINED OF THEM HAD ENTERED INTO THE FORTIFIED CITIES THEN ALL THE PEOPLE RETURNED SAFE TO JOSHUA IN THE CAMP AT MAKKEDAH

NOT A MAN MOVED HIS TONGUE AGAINST ANY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEN JOSHUA SAID OPEN THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND BRING THOSE FIVE KINGS OUT TO ME FROM THE CAVE

 AND THEY DID SO AND BROUGHT THOSE FIVE KINGS OUT TO HIM FROM THE CAVE THE KING OF JERUSALEM THE KING OF HEBRON THE KING OF JARMUTH THE KING OF LACHISH AND THE KING OF EGLON

AND WHEN THEY BROUGHT THOSE KINGS OUT TO JOSHUA JOSHUA SUMMONED ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL AND SAID TO THE CHIEFS OF THE MEN OF WAR WHO HAD GONE WITH HIM COME NEAR; PUT YOUR FEET ON THE NECKS OF THESE KINGS

 THEN THEY CAME NEAR AND PUT THEIR FEET ON THEIR NECKS

AND JOSHUA SAID TO THEM DO NOT BE AFRAID OR DISMAYED; BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS

FOR THUS THE LORD WILL DO TO ALL YOUR ENEMIES AGAINST WHOM YOU FIGHT

 AND AFTERWARD JOSHUA STRUCK THEM AND PUT THEM TO DEATH AND HE HANGED THEM ON FIVE TREES

AND THEY HUNG ON THE TREES UNTIL EVENING

BUT AT THE TIME OF THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN JOSHUA COMMANDED AND THEY TOOK THEM DOWN FROM THE TREES AND THREW THEM INTO THE CAVE WHERE THEY HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES AND THEY SET LARGE STONES AGAINST THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WHICH REMAIN TO THIS VERY DAY

AS FOR MAKKEDAH JOSHUA CAPTURED IT ON THAT DAY AND STRUCK IT AND ITS KING WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

HE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION EVERY PERSON IN IT; HE LEFT NONE REMAINING

AND HE DID TO THE KING OF MAKKEDAH JUST AS HE HAD DONE TO THE KING OF JERICHO

THEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM PASSED ON FROM MAKKEDAH TO LIBNAH AND FOUGHT AGAINST LIBNAH

AND THE LORD GAVE IT ALSO AND ITS KING INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL

AND HE STRUCK IT WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND EVERY PERSON IN IT; HE LEFT NONE REMAINING IN IT

AND HE DID TO ITS KING AS HE HAD DONE TO THE KING OF JERICHO

THEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM PASSED ON FROM LIBNAH TO LACHISH AND LAID SIEGE TO IT AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT

AND THE LORD GAVE LACHISH INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL AND HE CAPTURED IT ON THE SECOND DAY AND STRUCK IT WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND EVERY PERSON IN IT AS HE HAD DONE TO LIBNAH

THEN HORAM KING OF GEZER CAME UP TO HELP LACHISH

AND JOSHUA STRUCK HIM AND HIS PEOPLE UNTIL HE LEFT NONE REMAINING

THEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM PASSED ON FROM LACHISH TO EGLON

AND THEY LAID SIEGE TO IT AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT

AND THEY CAPTURED IT ON THAT DAY AND STRUCK IT WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD

AND HE DEVOTED EVERY PERSON IN IT TO DESTRUCTION THAT DAY AS HE HAD DONE TO LACHISH

THEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM WENT UP FROM EGLON TO HEBRON

AND THEY FOUGHT AGAINST IT AND CAPTURED IT AND STRUCK IT WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND ITS KING AND ITS TOWNS AND EVERY PERSON IN IT

HE LEFT NONE REMAINING AS HE HAD DONE TO EGLON AND DEVOTED IT TO DESTRUCTION AND EVERY PERSON IN IT

THEN JOSHUA AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM TURNED BACK TO DEBIR AND FOUGHT AGAINST IT AND HE CAPTURED IT WITH ITS KING AND ALL ITS TOWNS

AND THEY STRUCK THEM WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION EVERY PERSON IN IT; HE LEFT NONE REMAINING

JUST AS HE HAD DONE TO HEBRON AND TO LIBNAH AND ITS KING SO HE DID TO DEBIR AND TO ITS KING

SO JOSHUA STRUCK THE WHOLE LAND THE HILL COUNTRY AND THE NEGEB AND THE LOWLAND AND THE SLOPES AND ALL THEIR KINGS

HE LEFT NONE REMAINING BUT DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION ALL THAT BREATHED JUST AS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL COMMANDED

AND JOSHUA STRUCK THEM FROM KADESHBARNEA AS FAR AS GAZA AND ALL THE COUNTRY OF GOSHEN AS FAR AS GIBEON

AND JOSHUA CAPTURED ALL THESE KINGS AND THEIR LAND AT ONE TIME BECAUSE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL FOUGHT FOR ISRAEL

THEN JOSHUA RETURNED AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM TO THE CAMP AT GILGAL

WHEN JABIN KING OF HAZOR HEARD OF THIS HE SENT TO JOBAB KING OF MADON AND TO THE KING OF SHIMRON AND TO THE KING OF ACHSHAPH AND TO THE KINGS WHO WERE IN THE NORTHERN HILL COUNTRY AND IN THE ARABAH SOUTH OF CHINNEROTH AND IN THE LOWLAND AND IN NAPHOTHDOR ON THE WEST TO THE CANAANITES IN THE EAST AND THE WEST THE AMORITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES AND THE JEBUSITES IN THE HILL COUNTRY AND THE HIVITES UNDER HERMON IN THE LAND OF MIZPAH

AND THEY CAME OUT WITH ALL THEIR TROOPS A GREAT HORDE IN NUMBER LIKE THE SAND THAT IS ON THE SEASHORE WITH VERY MANY HORSES AND CHARIOTS

AND ALL THESE KINGS JOINED THEIR FORCES AND CAME AND ENCAMPED TOGETHER AT THE WATERS OF MEROM TO FIGHT WITH ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SAID TO JOSHUA DO NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM FOR TOMORROW AT THIS TIME I WILL GIVE OVER ALL OF THEM SLAIN TO ISRAEL

YOU SHALL HAMSTRING THEIR HORSES AND BURN THEIR CHARIOTS WITH FIRE

 SO JOSHUA AND ALL HIS WARRIORS CAME SUDDENLY AGAINST THEM BY THE WATERS OF MEROM AND FELL UPON THEM

AND THE LORD GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF ISRAEL WHO STRUCK THEM AND CHASED THEM AS FAR AS GREAT SIDON AND MISREPHOTHMAIM AND EASTWARD AS FAR AS THE VALLEY OF MIZPEH

AND THEY STRUCK THEM UNTIL HE LEFT NONE REMAINING

AND JOSHUA DID TO THEM JUST AS THE LORD SAID TO HIM HE HAMSTRUNG THEIR HORSES AND BURNED THEIR CHARIOTS WITH FIRE

AND JOSHUA TURNED BACK AT THAT TIME AND CAPTURED HAZOR AND STRUCK ITS KING WITH THE SWORD FOR HAZOR FORMERLY WAS THE HEAD OF ALL THOSE KINGDOMS

AND THEY STRUCK WITH THE SWORD ALL WHO WERE IN IT DEVOTING THEM TO DESTRUCTION; THERE WAS NONE LEFT THAT BREATHED

AND HE BURNED HAZOR WITH FIRE

AND ALL THE CITIES OF THOSE KINGS AND ALL THEIR KINGS JOSHUA CAPTURED AND STRUCK THEM WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD DEVOTING THEM TO DESTRUCTION JUST AS MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD HAD COMMANDED

BUT NONE OF THE CITIES THAT STOOD ON MOUNDS DID ISRAEL BURN EXCEPT HAZOR ALONE; THAT JOSHUA BURNED

AND ALL THE SPOIL OF THESE CITIES AND THE LIVESTOCK THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TOOK FOR THEIR PLUNDER

BUT EVERY MAN THEY STRUCK WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD UNTIL THEY HAD DESTROYED THEM AND THEY DID NOT LEAVE ANY WHO BREATHED

JUST AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES HIS SERVANT SO MOSES COMMANDED JOSHUA AND SO JOSHUA DID

HE LEFT NOTHING UNDONE OF ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES

SO JOSHUA TOOK ALL THAT LAND THE HILL COUNTRY AND ALL THE NEGEB AND ALL THE LAND OF GOSHEN AND THE LOWLAND AND THE ARABAH AND THE HILL COUNTRY OF ISRAEL AND ITS LOWLAND FROM MOUNT HALAK WHICH RISES TOWARD SEIR AS FAR AS BAALGAD IN THE VALLEY OF LEBANON BELOW MOUNT HERMON

AND HE CAPTURED ALL THEIR KINGS AND STRUCK THEM AND PUT THEM TO DEATH

JOSHUA MADE WAR A LONG TIME WITH ALL THOSE KINGS

THERE WAS NOT A CITY THAT MADE PEACE WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EXCEPT THE HIVITES THE INHABITANTS OF GIBEON

THEY TOOK THEM ALL IN BATTLE

FOR IT WAS THE LORD'S DOING TO HARDEN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY SHOULD COME AGAINST ISRAEL IN BATTLE IN ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION AND SHOULD RECEIVE NO MERCY BUT BE DESTROYED JUST AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

AND JOSHUA CAME AT THAT TIME AND CUT OFF THE ANAKIM FROM THE HILL COUNTRY FROM HEBRON FROM DEBIR FROM ANAB AND FROM ALL THE HILL COUNTRY OF JUDAH AND FROM ALL THE HILL COUNTRY OF ISRAEL

JOSHUA DEVOTED THEM TO DESTRUCTION WITH THEIR CITIES

THERE WAS NONE OF THE ANAKIM LEFT IN THE LAND OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

ONLY IN GAZA IN GATH AND IN ASHDOD DID SOME REMAIN

SO JOSHUA TOOK THE WHOLE LAND ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD HAD SPOKEN TO MOSES

AND JOSHUA GAVE IT FOR AN INHERITANCE TO ISRAEL ACCORDING TO THEIR TRIBAL ALLOTMENTS

AND THE LAND HAD REST FROM WAR

NOW THESE ARE THE KINGS OF THE LAND WHOM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEFEATED AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR LAND BEYOND THE JORDAN TOWARD THE SUNRISE FROM THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON TO MOUNT HERMON WITH ALL THE ARABAH EASTWARD SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED AT HESHBON AND RULED FROM AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AND FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY AS FAR AS THE RIVER JABBOK THE BOUNDARY OF THE AMMONITES THAT IS HALF OF GILEAD AND THE ARABAH TO THE SEA OF CHINNEROTH EASTWARD AND IN THE DIRECTION OF BETHJESHIMOTH TO THE SEA OF THE ARABAH THE SALT SEA SOUTHWARD TO THE FOOT OF THE SLOPES OF PISGAH; AND OG KING OF BASHAN ONE OF THE REMNANT OF THE REPHAIM WHO LIVED AT ASHTAROTH AND AT EDREI AND RULED OVER MOUNT HERMON AND SALECAH AND ALL BASHAN TO THE BOUNDARY OF THE GESHURITES AND THE MAACATHITES AND OVER HALF OF GILEAD TO THE BOUNDARY OF SIHON KING OF HESHBON

MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEFEATED THEM

AND MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD GAVE THEIR LAND FOR A POSSESSION TO THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH

AND THESE ARE THE KINGS OF THE LAND WHOM JOSHUA AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DEFEATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE JORDAN FROM BAALGAD IN THE VALLEY OF LEBANON TO MOUNT HALAK THAT RISES TOWARD SEIR AND JOSHUA GAVE THEIR LAND TO THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL AS A POSSESSION ACCORDING TO THEIR ALLOTMENTS IN THE HILL COUNTRY IN THE LOWLAND IN THE ARABAH IN THE SLOPES IN THE WILDERNESS AND IN THE NEGEB THE LAND OF THE HITTITES THE AMORITES THE CANAANITES THE PERIZZITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES THE KING OF JERICHO ONE; THE KING OF AI WHICH IS BESIDE BETHEL ONE; THE KING OF JERUSALEM ONE; THE KING OF HEBRON ONE; THE KING OF JARMUTH ONE; THE KING OF LACHISH ONE; THE KING OF EGLON ONE; THE KING OF GEZER ONE; THE KING OF DEBIR ONE; THE KING OF GEDER ONE; THE KING OF HORMAH ONE; THE KING OF ARAD ONE; THE KING OF LIBNAH ONE; THE KING OF ADULLAM ONE; THE KING OF MAKKEDAH ONE; THE KING OF BETHEL ONE; THE KING OF TAPPUAH ONE; THE KING OF HEPHER ONE; THE KING OF APHEK ONE; THE KING OF LASHARON ONE; THE KING OF MADON ONE; THE KING OF HAZOR ONE; THE KING OF SHIMRONMERON ONE; THE KING OF ACHSHAPH ONE; THE KING OF TAANACH ONE; THE KING OF MEGIDDO ONE; THE KING OF KEDESH ONE; THE KING OF JOKNEAM IN CARMEL ONE; THE KING OF DOR IN NAPHATHDOR ONE; THE KING OF GOIIM IN GALILEE ONE; THE KING OF TIRZAH ONE IN ALL THIRTYONE KINGS

NOW JOSHUA WAS OLD AND ADVANCED IN YEARS AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM YOU ARE OLD AND ADVANCED IN YEARS AND THERE REMAINS YET VERY MUCH LAND TO POSSESS

THIS IS THE LAND THAT YET REMAINS ALL THE REGIONS OF THE PHILISTINES AND ALL THOSE OF THE GESHURITES FROM THE SHIHOR WHICH IS EAST OF EGYPT NORTHWARD TO THE BOUNDARY OF EKRON IT IS COUNTED AS CANAANITE; THERE ARE FIVE RULERS OF THE PHILISTINES THOSE OF GAZA ASHDOD ASHKELON GATH AND EKRON AND THOSE OF THE AVVIM IN THE SOUTH ALL THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES AND MEARAH THAT BELONGS TO THE SIDONIANS TO APHEK TO THE BOUNDARY OF THE AMORITES AND THE LAND OF THE GEBALITES AND ALL LEBANON TOWARD THE SUNRISE FROM BAALGAD BELOW MOUNT HERMON TO LEBOHAMATH ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE HILL COUNTRY FROM LEBANON TO MISREPHOTHMAIM EVEN ALL THE SIDONIANS

I MYSELF WILL DRIVE THEM OUT FROM BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

ONLY ALLOT THE LAND TO ISRAEL FOR AN INHERITANCE AS I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

NOW THEREFORE DIVIDE THIS LAND FOR AN INHERITANCE TO THE NINE TRIBES AND HALF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH

 WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES RECEIVED THEIR INHERITANCE WHICH MOSES GAVE THEM BEYOND THE JORDAN EASTWARD AS MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD GAVE THEM FROM AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AND THE CITY THAT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY AND ALL THE TABLELAND OF MEDEBA AS FAR AS DIBON; AND ALL THE CITIES OF SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES WHO REIGNED IN HESHBON AS FAR AS THE BOUNDARY OF THE AMMONITES; AND GILEAD AND THE REGION OF THE GESHURITES AND MAACATHITES AND ALL MOUNT HERMON AND ALL BASHAN TO SALECAH; ALL THE KINGDOM OF OG IN BASHAN WHO REIGNED IN ASHTAROTH AND IN EDREI HE ALONE WAS LEFT OF THE REMNANT OF THE REPHAIM; THESE MOSES HAD STRUCK AND DRIVEN OUT

YET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE GESHURITES OR THE MAACATHITES BUT GESHUR AND MAACATH DWELL IN THE MIDST OF ISRAEL TO THIS DAY

TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI ALONE MOSES GAVE NO INHERITANCE

THE OFFERINGS BY FIRE TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL ARE THEIR INHERITANCE AS HE SAID TO HIM

AND MOSES GAVE AN INHERITANCE TO THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS

SO THEIR TERRITORY WAS FROM AROER WHICH IS ON THE EDGE OF THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON AND THE CITY THAT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY AND ALL THE TABLELAND BY MEDEBA; WITH HESHBON AND ALL ITS CITIES THAT ARE IN THE TABLELAND; DIBON AND BAMOTHBAAL AND BETHBAALMEON AND JAHAZ AND KEDEMOTH AND MEPHAATH AND KIRIATHAIM AND SIBMAH AND ZERETHSHAHAR ON THE HILL OF THE VALLEY AND BETHPEOR AND THE SLOPES OF PISGAH AND BETHJESHIMOTH THAT IS ALL THE CITIES OF THE TABLELAND AND ALL THE KINGDOM OF SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES WHO REIGNED IN HESHBON WHOM MOSES DEFEATED WITH THE LEADERS OF MIDIAN EVI AND REKEM AND ZUR AND HUR AND REBA THE PRINCES OF SIHON WHO LIVED IN THE LAND

BALAAM ALSO THE SON OF BEOR THE ONE WHO PRACTICED DIVINATION WAS KILLED WITH THE SWORD BY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AMONG THE REST OF THEIR SLAIN

AND THE BORDER OF THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN WAS THE JORDAN AS A BOUNDARY

THIS WAS THE INHERITANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS WITH THEIR CITIES AND VILLAGES

MOSES GAVE AN INHERITANCE ALSO TO THE TRIBE OF GAD TO THE PEOPLE OF GAD ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS

THEIR TERRITORY WAS JAZER AND ALL THE CITIES OF GILEAD AND HALF THE LAND OF THE AMMONITES TO AROER WHICH IS EAST OF RABBAH AND FROM HESHBON TO RAMATHMIZPEH AND BETONIM AND FROM MAHANAIM TO THE TERRITORY OF DEBIR AND IN THE VALLEY BETHHARAM BETHNIMRAH SUCCOTH AND ZAPHON THE REST OF THE KINGDOM OF SIHON KING OF HESHBON HAVING THE JORDAN AS A BOUNDARY TO THE LOWER END OF THE SEA OF CHINNERETH EASTWARD BEYOND THE JORDAN

THESE WERE ALLOTTED TO THE PEOPLE OF MACHIR THE SON OF MANASSEH FOR THE HALF OF THE PEOPLE OF MACHIR ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS

THESE ARE THE INHERITANCES THAT MOSES DISTRIBUTED IN THE PLAINS OF MOAB BEYOND THE JORDAN EAST OF JERICHO

BUT TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI MOSES GAVE NO INHERITANCE; THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL IS THEIR INHERITANCE JUST AS HE SAID TO THEM

THESE ARE THE INHERITANCES THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL RECEIVED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GAVE THEM TO INHERIT

THEIR INHERITANCE WAS BY LOT JUST AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED BY THE HAND OF MOSES FOR THE NINE AND ONEHALF TRIBES

FOR MOSES HAD GIVEN AN INHERITANCE TO THE TWO AND ONEHALF TRIBES BEYOND THE JORDAN BUT TO THE LEVITES HE GAVE NO INHERITANCE AMONG THEM

FOR THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH WERE TWO TRIBES MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM

AND NO PORTION WAS GIVEN TO THE LEVITES IN THE LAND BUT ONLY CITIES TO DWELL IN WITH THEIR PASTURELANDS FOR THEIR LIVESTOCK AND THEIR SUBSTANCE

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES; THEY ALLOTTED THE LAND

THEN THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH CAME TO JOSHUA AT GILGAL

AND CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH THE KENIZZITE SAID TO HIM YOU KNOW WHAT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES THE MAN OF GOD IN KADESHBARNEA CONCERNING YOU AND ME

I WAS FORTY YEARS OLD WHEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD SENT ME FROM KADESHBARNEA TO SPY OUT THE LAND AND I BROUGHT HIM WORD AGAIN AS IT WAS IN MY HEART

BUT MY BROTHERS WHO WENT UP WITH ME MADE THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE MELT; YET I WHOLLY FOLLOWED THE LORD MY GOD

AND MOSES SWORE ON THAT DAY SAYING 'SURELY THE LAND ON WHICH YOUR FOOT HAS TRODDEN SHALL BE AN INHERITANCE FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN FOREVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE WHOLLY FOLLOWED THE LORD MY GOD

' AND NOW BEHOLD THE LORD HAS KEPT ME ALIVE JUST AS HE SAID THESE FORTYFIVE YEARS SINCE THE TIME THAT THE LORD SPOKE THIS WORD TO MOSES WHILE ISRAEL WALKED IN THE WILDERNESS

AND NOW BEHOLD I AM THIS DAY EIGHTYFIVE YEARS OLD

I AM STILL AS STRONG TODAY AS I WAS IN THE DAY THAT MOSES SENT ME; MY STRENGTH NOW IS AS MY STRENGTH WAS THEN FOR WAR AND FOR GOING AND COMING

SO NOW GIVE ME THIS HILL COUNTRY OF WHICH THE LORD SPOKE ON THAT DAY FOR YOU HEARD ON THAT DAY HOW THE ANAKIM WERE THERE WITH GREAT FORTIFIED CITIES

IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD WILL BE WITH ME AND I SHALL DRIVE THEM OUT JUST AS THE LORD SAID

 THEN JOSHUA BLESSED HIM AND HE GAVE HEBRON TO CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH FOR AN INHERITANCE

THEREFORE HEBRON BECAME THE INHERITANCE OF CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH THE KENIZZITE TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE WHOLLY FOLLOWED THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

NOW THE NAME OF HEBRON FORMERLY WAS KIRIATHARBA

ARBA WAS THE GREATEST MAN AMONG THE ANAKIM

 AND THE LAND HAD REST FROM WAR

THE ALLOTMENT FOR THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS REACHED SOUTHWARD TO THE BOUNDARY OF EDOM TO THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN AT THE FARTHEST SOUTH

THEN THE BOUNDARY COMES TO AN END AT THE SEA

AND THE WEST BOUNDARY WAS THE GREAT SEA WITH ITS COASTLINE

THIS IS THE BOUNDARY AROUND THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH ACCORDING TO THEIR CLANS

ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD TO JOSHUA HE GAVE TO CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH A PORTION AMONG THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH KIRIATHARBA THAT IS HEBRON ARBA WAS THE FATHER OF ANAK

AND CALEB DROVE OUT FROM THERE THE THREE SONS OF ANAK SHESHAI AND AHIMAN AND TALMAI THE DESCENDANTS OF ANAK

AND HE WENT UP FROM THERE AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF DEBIR

NOW THE NAME OF DEBIR FORMERLY WAS KIRIATHSEPHER

AND CALEB SAID WHOEVER STRIKES KIRIATHSEPHER AND CAPTURES IT TO HIM WILL I GIVE ACHSAH MY DAUGHTER AS WIFE

 AND OTHNIEL THE SON OF KENAZ THE BROTHER OF CALEB CAPTURED IT

AND HE GAVE HIM ACHSAH HIS DAUGHTER AS WIFE

WHEN SHE CAME TO HIM SHE URGED HIM TO ASK HER FATHER FOR A FIELD

AND SHE GOT OFF HER DONKEY AND CALEB SAID TO HER WHAT DO YOU WANT

 SHE SAID TO HIM GIVE ME A BLESSING

SINCE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THE LAND OF THE NEGEB GIVE ME ALSO SPRINGS OF WATER

 AND HE GAVE HER THE UPPER SPRINGS AND THE LOWER SPRINGS

BUT THE JEBUSITES THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH COULD NOT DRIVE OUT SO THE JEBUSITES DWELL WITH THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AT JERUSALEM TO THIS DAY

THE ALLOTMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH WENT FROM THE JORDAN BY JERICHO EAST OF THE WATERS OF JERICHO INTO THE WILDERNESS GOING UP FROM JERICHO INTO THE HILL COUNTRY TO BETHEL

THEN GOING FROM BETHEL TO LUZ IT PASSES ALONG TO ATAROTH THE TERRITORY OF THE ARCHITES

THEN IT GOES DOWN WESTWARD TO THE TERRITORY OF THE JAPHLETITES AS FAR AS THE TERRITORY OF LOWER BETHHORON THEN TO GEZER AND IT ENDS AT THE SEA

THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM RECEIVED THEIR INHERITANCE

HOWEVER THEY DID NOT DRIVE OUT THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN GEZER SO THE CANAANITES HAVE LIVED IN THE MIDST OF EPHRAIM TO THIS DAY BUT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DO FORCED LABOR

THEN ALLOTMENT WAS MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH FOR HE WAS THE FIRSTBORN OF JOSEPH

TO MACHIR THE FIRSTBORN OF MANASSEH THE FATHER OF GILEAD WERE ALLOTTED GILEAD AND BASHAN BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF WAR

AND ALLOTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH BY THEIR CLANS ABIEZER HELEK ASRIEL SHECHEM HEPHER AND SHEMIDA

THESE WERE THE MALE DESCENDANTS OF MANASSEH THE SON OF JOSEPH BY THEIR CLANS

NOW ZELOPHEHAD THE SON OF HEPHER SON OF GILEAD SON OF MACHIR SON OF MANASSEH HAD NO SONS BUT ONLY DAUGHTERS AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF HIS DAUGHTERS MAHLAH NOAH HOGLAH MILCAH AND TIRZAH

THEY APPROACHED ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND THE LEADERS AND SAID THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES TO GIVE US AN INHERITANCE ALONG WITH OUR BROTHERS

 SO ACCORDING TO THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HE GAVE THEM AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER

THUS THERE FELL TO MANASSEH TEN PORTIONS BESIDES THE LAND OF GILEAD AND BASHAN WHICH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF MANASSEH RECEIVED AN INHERITANCE ALONG WITH HIS SONS

THE LAND OF GILEAD WAS ALLOTTED TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH

THE TERRITORY OF MANASSEH REACHED FROM ASHER TO MICHMETHATH WHICH IS EAST OF SHECHEM

THEN THE BOUNDARY GOES ALONG SOUTHWARD TO THE INHABITANTS OF ENTAPPUAH

THE LAND OF TAPPUAH BELONGED TO MANASSEH BUT THE TOWN OF TAPPUAH ON THE BOUNDARY OF MANASSEH BELONGED TO THE PEOPLE OF EPHRAIM

YET THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH COULD NOT TAKE POSSESSION OF THOSE CITIES BUT THE CANAANITES PERSISTED IN DWELLING IN THAT LAND

NOW WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GREW STRONG THEY PUT THE CANAANITES TO FORCED LABOR BUT DID NOT UTTERLY DRIVE THEM OUT

THEN THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH SPOKE TO JOSHUA SAYING WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ME BUT ONE LOT AND ONE PORTION AS AN INHERITANCE ALTHOUGH I AM A NUMEROUS PEOPLE SINCE ALL ALONG THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME

 AND JOSHUA SAID TO THEM IF YOU ARE A NUMEROUS PEOPLE GO UP BY YOURSELVES TO THE FOREST AND THERE CLEAR GROUND FOR YOURSELVES IN THE LAND OF THE PERIZZITES AND THE REPHAIM SINCE THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM IS TOO NARROW FOR YOU

 THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH SAID THE HILL COUNTRY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US

YET ALL THE CANAANITES WHO DWELL IN THE PLAIN HAVE CHARIOTS OF IRON BOTH THOSE IN BETHSHEAN AND ITS VILLAGES AND THOSE IN THE VALLEY OF JEZREEL

 THEN JOSHUA SAID TO THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH TO EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH YOU ARE A NUMEROUS PEOPLE AND HAVE GREAT POWER

YOU SHALL NOT HAVE ONE ALLOTMENT ONLY BUT THE HILL COUNTRY SHALL BE YOURS FOR THOUGH IT IS A FOREST YOU SHALL CLEAR IT AND POSSESS IT TO ITS FARTHEST BORDERS

FOR YOU SHALL DRIVE OUT THE CANAANITES THOUGH THEY HAVE CHARIOTS OF IRON AND THOUGH THEY ARE STRONG

THE LAND LAY SUBDUED BEFORE THEM

THERE REMAINED AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SEVEN TRIBES WHOSE INHERITANCE HAD NOT YET BEEN APPORTIONED

PROVIDE THREE MEN FROM EACH TRIBE AND I WILL SEND THEM OUT THAT THEY MAY SET OUT AND GO UP AND DOWN THE LAND

THEY SHALL WRITE A DESCRIPTION OF IT WITH A VIEW TO THEIR INHERITANCES AND THEN COME TO ME

AND GAD AND REUBEN AND HALF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH HAVE RECEIVED THEIR INHERITANCE BEYOND THE JORDAN EASTWARD WHICH MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD GAVE THEM

 SO THE MEN AROSE AND WENT AND JOSHUA CHARGED THOSE WHO WENT TO WRITE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LAND SAYING GO UP AND DOWN IN THE LAND AND WRITE A DESCRIPTION AND RETURN TO ME

THE CITIES OF THE LEVITES IN THE MIDST OF THE POSSESSION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE IN ALL FORTYEIGHT CITIES WITH THEIR PASTURELANDS

THESE CITIES EACH HAD ITS PASTURELANDS AROUND IT

SO IT WAS WITH ALL THESE CITIES

THUS THE LORD GAVE TO ISRAEL ALL THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO GIVE TO THEIR FATHERS

AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF IT AND THEY SETTLED THERE

AND THE LORD GAVE THEM REST ON EVERY SIDE JUST AS HE HAD SWORN TO THEIR FATHERS

NOT ONE OF ALL THEIR ENEMIES HAD WITHSTOOD THEM FOR THE LORD HAD GIVEN ALL THEIR ENEMIES INTO THEIR HANDS

NOT ONE WORD OF ALL THE GOOD PROMISES THAT THE LORD HAD MADE TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL HAD FAILED; ALL CAME TO PASS

AT THAT TIME JOSHUA SUMMONED THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH AND SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE KEPT ALL THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD COMMANDED YOU AND HAVE OBEYED MY VOICE IN ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED YOU

YOU HAVE NOT FORSAKEN YOUR BROTHERS THESE MANY DAYS DOWN TO THIS DAY BUT HAVE BEEN CAREFUL TO KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD

AND NOW THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS GIVEN REST TO YOUR BROTHERS AS HE PROMISED THEM

THEREFORE TURN AND GO TO YOUR TENTS IN THE LAND WHERE YOUR POSSESSION LIES WHICH MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD GAVE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN

ONLY BE VERY CAREFUL TO OBSERVE THE COMMANDMENT AND THE LAW THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD COMMANDED YOU TO LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND TO WALK IN ALL HIS WAYS AND TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND TO CLING TO HIM AND TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL

 SO JOSHUA BLESSED THEM AND SENT THEM AWAY AND THEY WENT TO THEIR TENTS

NOW TO THE ONE HALF OF THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH MOSES HAD GIVEN A POSSESSION IN BASHAN BUT TO THE OTHER HALF JOSHUA HAD GIVEN A POSSESSION BESIDE THEIR BROTHERS IN THE LAND WEST OF THE JORDAN

AND WHEN JOSHUA SENT THEM AWAY TO THEIR HOMES AND BLESSED THEM HE SAID TO THEM GO BACK TO YOUR TENTS WITH MUCH WEALTH AND WITH VERY MUCH LIVESTOCK WITH SILVER GOLD BRONZE AND IRON AND WITH MUCH CLOTHING

DIVIDE THE SPOIL OF YOUR ENEMIES WITH YOUR BROTHERS

 SO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH RETURNED HOME PARTING FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT SHILOH WHICH IS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN TO GO TO THE LAND OF GILEAD THEIR OWN LAND OF WHICH THEY HAD POSSESSED THEMSELVES BY COMMAND OF THE LORD THROUGH MOSES

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE REGION OF THE JORDAN THAT IS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH BUILT THERE AN ALTAR BY THE JORDAN AN ALTAR OF IMPOSING SIZE

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HEARD IT SAID BEHOLD THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH HAVE BUILT THE ALTAR AT THE FRONTIER OF THE LAND OF CANAAN IN THE REGION ABOUT THE JORDAN ON THE SIDE THAT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 AND WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HEARD OF IT THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GATHERED AT SHILOH TO MAKE WAR AGAINST THEM

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SENT TO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH IN THE LAND OF GILEAD PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND WITH HIM TEN CHIEFS ONE FROM EACH OF THE TRIBAL FAMILIES OF ISRAEL EVERY ONE OF THEM THE HEAD OF A FAMILY AMONG THE CLANS OF ISRAEL

AND THEY CAME TO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH IN THE LAND OF GILEAD AND THEY SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE LORD 'WHAT IS THIS BREACH OF FAITH THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST THE GOD OF ISRAEL IN TURNING AWAY THIS DAY FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD BY BUILDING YOURSELVES AN ALTAR THIS DAY IN REBELLION AGAINST THE LORD

HAVE WE NOT HAD ENOUGH OF THE SIN AT PEOR FROM WHICH EVEN YET WE HAVE NOT CLEANSED OURSELVES AND FOR WHICH THERE CAME A PLAGUE UPON THE CONGREGATION OF THE LORD THAT YOU TOO MUST TURN AWAY THIS DAY FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD

AND IF YOU TOO REBEL AGAINST THE LORD TODAY THEN TOMORROW HE WILL BE ANGRY WITH THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL

BUT NOW IF THE LAND OF YOUR POSSESSION IS UNCLEAN PASS OVER INTO THE LORD'S LAND WHERE THE LORD'S TABERNACLE STANDS AND TAKE FOR YOURSELVES A POSSESSION AMONG US

ONLY DO NOT REBEL AGAINST THE LORD OR MAKE US AS REBELS BY BUILDING FOR YOURSELVES AN ALTAR OTHER THAN THE ALTAR OF THE LORD OUR GOD

DID NOT ACHAN THE SON OF ZERAH BREAK FAITH IN THE MATTER OF THE DEVOTED THINGS AND WRATH FELL UPON ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL

AND HE DID NOT PERISH ALONE FOR HIS INIQUITY

' THEN THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH SAID IN ANSWER TO THE HEADS OF THE FAMILIES OF ISRAEL THE MIGHTY ONE GOD THE LORD

THE MIGHTY ONE GOD THE LORD

HE KNOWS; AND LET ISRAEL ITSELF KNOW

IF IT WAS IN REBELLION OR IN BREACH OF FAITH AGAINST THE LORD DO NOT SPARE US TODAY FOR BUILDING AN ALTAR TO TURN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD

OR IF WE DID SO TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS OR GRAIN OFFERINGS OR PEACE OFFERINGS ON IT MAY THE LORD HIMSELF TAKE VENGEANCE

NO BUT WE DID IT FROM FEAR THAT IN TIME TO COME YOUR CHILDREN MIGHT SAY TO OUR CHILDREN 'WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

FOR THE LORD HAS MADE THE JORDAN A BOUNDARY BETWEEN US AND YOU YOU PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND PEOPLE OF GAD

YOU HAVE NO PORTION IN THE LORD

' SO YOUR CHILDREN MIGHT MAKE OUR CHILDREN CEASE TO WORSHIP THE LORD

THEREFORE WE SAID 'LET US NOW BUILD AN ALTAR NOT FOR BURNT OFFERING NOR FOR SACRIFICE BUT TO BE A WITNESS BETWEEN US AND YOU AND BETWEEN OUR GENERATIONS AFTER US THAT WE DO PERFORM THE SERVICE OF THE LORD IN HIS PRESENCE WITH OUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES AND PEACE OFFERINGS SO YOUR CHILDREN WILL NOT SAY TO OUR CHILDREN IN TIME TO COME YOU HAVE NO PORTION IN THE LORD

' AND WE THOUGHT IF THIS SHOULD BE SAID TO US OR TO OUR DESCENDANTS IN TIME TO COME WE SHOULD SAY 'BEHOLD THE COPY OF THE ALTAR OF THE LORD WHICH OUR FATHERS MADE NOT FOR BURNT OFFERINGS NOR FOR SACRIFICE BUT TO BE A WITNESS BETWEEN US AND YOU

' FAR BE IT FROM US THAT WE SHOULD REBEL AGAINST THE LORD AND TURN AWAY THIS DAY FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD BY BUILDING AN ALTAR FOR BURNT OFFERING GRAIN OFFERING OR SACRIFICE OTHER THAN THE ALTAR OF THE LORD OUR GOD THAT STANDS BEFORE HIS TABERNACLE

 WHEN PHINEHAS THE PRIEST AND THE CHIEFS OF THE CONGREGATION THE HEADS OF THE FAMILIES OF ISRAEL WHO WERE WITH HIM HEARD THE WORDS THAT THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH SPOKE IT WAS GOOD IN THEIR EYES

AND PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH TODAY WE KNOW THAT THE LORD IS IN OUR MIDST BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT COMMITTED THIS BREACH OF FAITH AGAINST THE LORD

NOW YOU HAVE DELIVERED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD

 THEN PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND THE CHIEFS RETURNED FROM THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD IN THE LAND OF GILEAD TO THE LAND OF CANAAN TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND BROUGHT BACK WORD TO THEM

AND THE REPORT WAS GOOD IN THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BLESSED GOD AND SPOKE NO MORE OF MAKING WAR AGAINST THEM TO DESTROY THE LAND WHERE THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD WERE SETTLED

THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD CALLED THE ALTAR WITNESS FOR THEY SAID IT IS A WITNESS BETWEEN US THAT THE LORD IS GOD

A LONG TIME AFTERWARD WHEN THE LORD HAD GIVEN REST TO ISRAEL FROM ALL THEIR SURROUNDING ENEMIES AND JOSHUA WAS OLD AND WELL ADVANCED IN YEARS JOSHUA SUMMONED ALL ISRAEL ITS ELDERS AND HEADS ITS JUDGES AND OFFICERS AND SAID TO THEM I AM NOW OLD AND WELL ADVANCED IN YEARS

AND YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS DONE TO ALL THESE NATIONS FOR YOUR SAKE FOR IT IS THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO HAS FOUGHT FOR YOU

BEHOLD I HAVE ALLOTTED TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE FOR YOUR TRIBES THOSE NATIONS THAT REMAIN ALONG WITH ALL THE NATIONS THAT I HAVE ALREADY CUT OFF FROM THE JORDAN TO THE GREAT SEA IN THE WEST

THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL PUSH THEM BACK BEFORE YOU AND DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT

AND YOU SHALL POSSESS THEIR LAND JUST AS THE LORD YOUR GOD PROMISED YOU

THEREFORE BE VERY STRONG TO KEEP AND TO DO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF MOSES TURNING ASIDE FROM IT NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR TO THE LEFT THAT YOU MAY NOT MIX WITH THESE NATIONS REMAINING AMONG YOU OR MAKE MENTION OF THE NAMES OF THEIR GODS OR SWEAR BY THEM OR SERVE THEM OR BOW DOWN TO THEM BUT YOU SHALL CLING TO THE LORD YOUR GOD JUST AS YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS DAY

FOR THE LORD HAS DRIVEN OUT BEFORE YOU GREAT AND STRONG NATIONS

AND AS FOR YOU NO MAN HAS BEEN ABLE TO STAND BEFORE YOU TO THIS DAY

ONE MAN OF YOU PUTS TO FLIGHT A THOUSAND SINCE IT IS THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO FIGHTS FOR YOU JUST AS HE PROMISED YOU

BE VERY CAREFUL THEREFORE TO LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD

FOR IF YOU TURN BACK AND CLING TO THE REMNANT OF THESE NATIONS REMAINING AMONG YOU AND MAKE MARRIAGES WITH THEM SO THAT YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND THEY WITH YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL NO LONGER DRIVE OUT THESE NATIONS BEFORE YOU BUT THEY SHALL BE A SNARE AND A TRAP FOR YOU A WHIP ON YOUR SIDES AND THORNS IN YOUR EYES UNTIL YOU PERISH FROM OFF THIS GOOD GROUND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS GIVEN YOU

AND NOW I AM ABOUT TO GO THE WAY OF ALL THE EARTH AND YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEARTS AND SOULS ALL OF YOU THAT NOT ONE WORD HAS FAILED OF ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD PROMISED CONCERNING YOU

ALL HAVE COME TO PASS FOR YOU; NOT ONE OF THEM HAS FAILED

BUT JUST AS ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD PROMISED CONCERNING YOU HAVE BEEN FULFILLED FOR YOU SO THE LORD WILL BRING UPON YOU ALL THE EVIL THINGS UNTIL HE HAS DESTROYED YOU FROM OFF THIS GOOD LAND THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS GIVEN YOU IF YOU TRANSGRESS THE COVENANT OF THE LORD YOUR GOD WHICH HE COMMANDED YOU AND GO AND SERVE OTHER GODS AND BOW DOWN TO THEM

THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU AND YOU SHALL PERISH QUICKLY FROM OFF THE GOOD LAND THAT HE HAS GIVEN TO YOU

JOSHUA GATHERED ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO SHECHEM AND SUMMONED THE ELDERS THE HEADS THE JUDGES AND THE OFFICERS OF ISRAEL

AND THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE GOD

AND JOSHUA SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'LONG AGO YOUR FATHERS LIVED BEYOND THE EUPHRATES TERAH THE FATHER OF ABRAHAM AND OF NAHOR; AND THEY SERVED OTHER GODS

THEN I TOOK YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM FROM BEYOND THE RIVER AND LED HIM THROUGH ALL THE LAND OF CANAAN AND MADE HIS OFFSPRING MANY

I GAVE HIM ISAAC

AND TO ISAAC I GAVE JACOB AND ESAU

AND I GAVE ESAU THE HILL COUNTRY OF SEIR TO POSSESS BUT JACOB AND HIS CHILDREN WENT DOWN TO EGYPT

AND I SENT MOSES AND AARON AND I PLAGUED EGYPT WITH WHAT I DID IN THE MIDST OF IT AND AFTERWARD I BROUGHT YOU OUT

'THEN I BROUGHT YOUR FATHERS OUT OF EGYPT AND YOU CAME TO THE SEA

AND THE EGYPTIANS PURSUED YOUR FATHERS WITH CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN TO THE RED SEA

AND WHEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD HE PUT DARKNESS BETWEEN YOU AND THE EGYPTIANS AND MADE THE SEA COME UPON THEM AND COVER THEM; AND YOUR EYES SAW WHAT I DID IN EGYPT

AND YOU LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS A LONG TIME

THEN I BROUGHT YOU TO THE LAND OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN

THEY FOUGHT WITH YOU AND I GAVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND AND YOU TOOK POSSESSION OF THEIR LAND AND I DESTROYED THEM BEFORE YOU

THEN BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR KING OF MOAB AROSE AND FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

AND HE SENT AND INVITED BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR TO CURSE YOU BUT I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO BALAAM

INDEED HE BLESSED YOU

SO I DELIVERED YOU OUT OF HIS HAND

AND YOU WENT OVER THE JORDAN AND CAME TO JERICHO AND THE LEADERS OF JERICHO FOUGHT AGAINST YOU AND ALSO THE AMORITES THE PERIZZITES THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE GIRGASHITES THE HIVITES AND THE JEBUSITES

AND I GAVE THEM INTO YOUR HAND

AND I SENT THE HORNET BEFORE YOU WHICH DROVE THEM OUT BEFORE YOU THE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES; IT WAS NOT BY YOUR SWORD OR BY YOUR BOW

I GAVE YOU A LAND ON WHICH YOU HAD NOT LABORED AND CITIES THAT YOU HAD NOT BUILT AND YOU DWELL IN THEM

YOU EAT THE FRUIT OF VINEYARDS AND OLIVE ORCHARDS THAT YOU DID NOT PLANT

' NOW THEREFORE FEAR THE LORD AND SERVE HIM IN SINCERITY AND IN FAITHFULNESS

PUT AWAY THE GODS THAT YOUR FATHERS SERVED BEYOND THE RIVER AND IN EGYPT AND SERVE THE LORD

AND IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES TO SERVE THE LORD CHOOSE THIS DAY WHOM YOU WILL SERVE WHETHER THE GODS YOUR FATHERS SERVED IN THE REGION BEYOND THE RIVER OR THE GODS OF THE AMORITES IN WHOSE LAND YOU DWELL

BUT AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE WE WILL SERVE THE LORD

 THEN THE PEOPLE ANSWERED FAR BE IT FROM US THAT WE SHOULD FORSAKE THE LORD TO SERVE OTHER GODS FOR IT IS THE LORD OUR GOD WHO BROUGHT US AND OUR FATHERS UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF SLAVERY AND WHO DID THOSE GREAT SIGNS IN OUR SIGHT AND PRESERVED US IN ALL THE WAY THAT WE WENT AND AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES THROUGH WHOM WE PASSED

AND THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE US ALL THE PEOPLES THE AMORITES WHO LIVED IN THE LAND

THEREFORE WE ALSO WILL SERVE THE LORD FOR HE IS OUR GOD

 BUT JOSHUA SAID TO THE PEOPLE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SERVE THE LORD FOR HE IS A HOLY GOD

HE IS A JEALOUS GOD; HE WILL NOT FORGIVE YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS OR YOUR SINS

IF YOU FORSAKE THE LORD AND SERVE FOREIGN GODS THEN HE WILL TURN AND DO YOU HARM AND CONSUME YOU AFTER HAVING DONE YOU GOOD

 AND THE PEOPLE SAID TO JOSHUA NO BUT WE WILL SERVE THE LORD

 THEN JOSHUA SAID TO THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WITNESSES AGAINST YOURSELVES THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE LORD TO SERVE HIM

 AND THEY SAID WE ARE WITNESSES

 HE SAID THEN PUT AWAY THE FOREIGN GODS THAT ARE AMONG YOU AND INCLINE YOUR HEART TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

 AND THE PEOPLE SAID TO JOSHUA THE LORD OUR GOD WE WILL SERVE AND HIS VOICE WE WILL OBEY

 SO JOSHUA MADE A COVENANT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT DAY AND PUT IN PLACE STATUTES AND RULES FOR THEM AT SHECHEM

AND JOSHUA WROTE THESE WORDS IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF GOD

AND HE TOOK A LARGE STONE AND SET IT UP THERE UNDER THE TEREBINTH THAT WAS BY THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD

AND JOSHUA SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE BEHOLD THIS STONE SHALL BE A WITNESS AGAINST US FOR IT HAS HEARD ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE TO US

THEREFORE IT SHALL BE A WITNESS AGAINST YOU LEST YOU DEAL FALSELY WITH YOUR GOD

 SO JOSHUA SENT THE PEOPLE AWAY EVERY MAN TO HIS INHERITANCE

AFTER THESE THINGS JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED BEING  YEARS OLD

AND THEY BURIED HIM IN HIS OWN INHERITANCE AT TIMNATHSERAH WHICH IS IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM NORTH OF THE MOUNTAIN OF GAASH

ISRAEL SERVED THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF JOSHUA AND ALL THE DAYS OF THE ELDERS WHO OUTLIVED JOSHUA AND HAD KNOWN ALL THE WORK THAT THE LORD DID FOR ISRAEL

AS FOR THE BONES OF JOSEPH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT UP FROM EGYPT THEY BURIED THEM AT SHECHEM IN THE PIECE OF LAND THAT JACOB BOUGHT FROM THE SONS OF HAMOR THE FATHER OF SHECHEM FOR A HUNDRED PIECES OF MONEY

IT BECAME AN INHERITANCE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF JOSEPH

AND ELEAZAR THE SON OF AARON DIED AND THEY BURIED HIM AT GIBEAH THE TOWN OF PHINEHAS HIS SON WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM IN THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM

 CORINTHIANSPAUL CALLED BY THE WILL OF GOD TO BE AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS AND OUR BROTHER SOSTHENES TO THE CHURCH OF GOD THAT IS IN CORINTH TO THOSE SANCTIFIED IN CHRIST JESUS CALLED TO BE SAINTS TOGETHER WITH ALL THOSE WHO IN EVERY PLACE CALL UPON THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BOTH THEIR LORD AND OURS GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

I GIVE THANKS TO MY GOD ALWAYS FOR YOU BECAUSE OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT WAS GIVEN YOU IN CHRIST JESUS THAT IN EVERY WAY YOU WERE ENRICHED IN HIM IN ALL SPEECH AND ALL KNOWLEDGE EVEN AS THE TESTIMONY ABOUT CHRIST WAS CONFIRMED AMONG YOU SO THAT YOU ARE NOT LACKING IN ANY SPIRITUAL GIFT AS YOU WAIT FOR THE REVEALING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO WILL SUSTAIN YOU TO THE END GUILTLESS IN THE DAY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

GOD IS FAITHFUL BY WHOM YOU WERE CALLED INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD

I APPEAL TO YOU BROTHERS BY THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT ALL OF YOU AGREE AND THAT THERE BE NO DIVISIONS AMONG YOU BUT THAT YOU BE UNITED IN THE SAME MIND AND THE SAME JUDGMENT

FOR IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO ME BY CHLOE'S PEOPLE THAT THERE IS QUARRELING AMONG YOU MY BROTHERS

WHAT I MEAN IS THAT EACH ONE OF YOU SAYS I FOLLOW PAUL OR I FOLLOW APOLLOS OR I FOLLOW CEPHAS OR I FOLLOW CHRIST

 IS CHRIST DIVIDED

WAS PAUL CRUCIFIED FOR YOU

OR WERE YOU BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF PAUL

I THANK GOD THAT I BAPTIZED NONE OF YOU EXCEPT CRISPUS AND GAIUS SO THAT NO ONE MAY SAY THAT YOU WERE BAPTIZED IN MY NAME

I DID BAPTIZE ALSO THE HOUSEHOLD OF STEPHANAS

BEYOND THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I BAPTIZED ANYONE ELSE

 FOR CHRIST DID NOT SEND ME TO BAPTIZE BUT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND NOT WITH WORDS OF ELOQUENT WISDOM LEST THE CROSS OF CHRIST BE EMPTIED OF ITS POWER

FOR THE WORD OF THE CROSS IS FOLLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PERISHING BUT TO US WHO ARE BEING SAVED IT IS THE POWER OF GOD

FOR IT IS WRITTEN I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE AND THE DISCERNMENT OF THE DISCERNING I WILL THWART

 WHERE IS THE ONE WHO IS WISE

WHERE IS THE SCRIBE

WHERE IS THE DEBATER OF THIS AGE

HAS NOT GOD MADE FOOLISH THE WISDOM OF THE WORLD

FOR SINCE IN THE WISDOM OF GOD THE WORLD DID NOT KNOW GOD THROUGH WISDOM IT PLEASED GOD THROUGH THE FOLLY OF WHAT WE PREACH TO SAVE THOSE WHO BELIEVE

FOR JEWS DEMAND SIGNS AND GREEKS SEEK WISDOM BUT WE PREACH CHRIST CRUCIFIED A STUMBLING BLOCK TO JEWS AND FOLLY TO GENTILES BUT TO THOSE WHO ARE CALLED BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS CHRIST THE POWER OF GOD AND THE WISDOM OF GOD

FOR THE FOOLISHNESS OF GOD IS WISER THAN MEN AND THE WEAKNESS OF GOD IS STRONGER THAN MEN

FOR CONSIDER YOUR CALLING BROTHERS NOT MANY OF YOU WERE WISE ACCORDING TO WORLDLY STANDARDS NOT MANY WERE POWERFUL NOT MANY WERE OF NOBLE BIRTH

BUT GOD CHOSE WHAT IS FOOLISH IN THE WORLD TO SHAME THE WISE; GOD CHOSE WHAT IS WEAK IN THE WORLD TO SHAME THE STRONG; GOD CHOSE WHAT IS LOW AND DESPISED IN THE WORLD EVEN THINGS THAT ARE NOT TO BRING TO NOTHING THINGS THAT ARE SO THAT NO HUMAN BEING MIGHT BOAST IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD

HE IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS WHOM GOD MADE OUR WISDOM AND OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SANCTIFICATION AND REDEMPTION

THEREFORE AS IT IS WRITTEN LET THE ONE WHO BOASTS BOAST IN THE LORD

AND I WHEN I CAME TO YOU BROTHERS DID NOT COME PROCLAIMING TO YOU THE TESTIMONY OF GOD WITH LOFTY SPEECH OR WISDOM

FOR I DECIDED TO KNOW NOTHING AMONG YOU EXCEPT JESUS CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED

AND I WAS WITH YOU IN WEAKNESS AND IN FEAR AND MUCH TREMBLING AND MY SPEECH AND MY MESSAGE WERE NOT IN PLAUSIBLE WORDS OF WISDOM BUT IN DEMONSTRATION OF THE SPIRIT AND OF POWER THAT YOUR FAITH MIGHT NOT REST IN THE WISDOM OF MEN BUT IN THE POWER OF GOD

YET AMONG THE MATURE WE DO IMPART WISDOM ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT A WISDOM OF THIS AGE OR OF THE RULERS OF THIS AGE WHO ARE DOOMED TO PASS AWAY

BUT WE IMPART A SECRET AND HIDDEN WISDOM OF GOD WHICH GOD DECREED BEFORE THE AGES FOR OUR GLORY

NONE OF THE RULERS OF THIS AGE UNDERSTOOD THIS FOR IF THEY HAD THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CRUCIFIED THE LORD OF GLORY

BUT AS IT IS WRITTEN WHAT NO EYE HAS SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NOR THE HEART OF MAN IMAGINED WHAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM THESE THINGS GOD HAS REVEALED TO US THROUGH THE SPIRIT

FOR THE SPIRIT SEARCHES EVERYTHING EVEN THE DEPTHS OF GOD

FOR WHO KNOWS A PERSON'S THOUGHTS EXCEPT THE SPIRIT OF THAT PERSON WHICH IS IN HIM

SO ALSO NO ONE COMPREHENDS THE THOUGHTS OF GOD EXCEPT THE SPIRIT OF GOD

NOW WE HAVE RECEIVED NOT THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD BUT THE SPIRIT WHO IS FROM GOD THAT WE MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE THINGS FREELY GIVEN US BY GOD

AND WE IMPART THIS IN WORDS NOT TAUGHT BY HUMAN WISDOM BUT TAUGHT BY THE SPIRIT INTERPRETING SPIRITUAL TRUTHS TO THOSE WHO ARE SPIRITUAL

THE NATURAL PERSON DOES NOT ACCEPT THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD FOR THEY ARE FOLLY TO HIM AND HE IS NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SPIRITUALLY DISCERNED

THE SPIRITUAL PERSON JUDGES ALL THINGS BUT IS HIMSELF TO BE JUDGED BY NO ONE

FOR WHO HAS UNDERSTOOD THE MIND OF THE LORD SO AS TO INSTRUCT HIM

 BUT WE HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST

BUT I BROTHERS COULD NOT ADDRESS YOU AS SPIRITUAL PEOPLE BUT AS PEOPLE OF THE FLESH AS INFANTS IN CHRIST

I FED YOU WITH MILK NOT SOLID FOOD FOR YOU WERE NOT READY FOR IT

AND EVEN NOW YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR YOU ARE STILL OF THE FLESH

FOR WHILE THERE IS JEALOUSY AND STRIFE AMONG YOU ARE YOU NOT OF THE FLESH AND BEHAVING ONLY IN A HUMAN WAY

FOR WHEN ONE SAYS I FOLLOW PAUL AND ANOTHER I FOLLOW APOLLOS ARE YOU NOT BEING MERELY HUMAN

WHAT THEN IS APOLLOS

WHAT IS PAUL

SERVANTS THROUGH WHOM YOU BELIEVED AS THE LORD ASSIGNED TO EACH

I PLANTED APOLLOS WATERED BUT GOD GAVE THE GROWTH

SO NEITHER HE WHO PLANTS NOR HE WHO WATERS IS ANYTHING BUT ONLY GOD WHO GIVES THE GROWTH

HE WHO PLANTS AND HE WHO WATERS ARE ONE AND EACH WILL RECEIVE HIS WAGES ACCORDING TO HIS LABOR

FOR WE ARE GOD'S FELLOW WORKERS

YOU ARE GOD'S FIELD GOD'S BUILDING

ACCORDING TO THE GRACE OF GOD GIVEN TO ME LIKE A SKILLED MASTER BUILDER I LAID A FOUNDATION AND SOMEONE ELSE IS BUILDING UPON IT

LET EACH ONE TAKE CARE HOW HE BUILDS UPON IT

FOR NO ONE CAN LAY A FOUNDATION OTHER THAN THAT WHICH IS LAID WHICH IS JESUS CHRIST

NOW IF ANYONE BUILDS ON THE FOUNDATION WITH GOLD SILVER PRECIOUS STONES WOOD HAY STRAW EACH ONE'S WORK WILL BECOME MANIFEST FOR THE DAY WILL DISCLOSE IT BECAUSE IT WILL BE REVEALED BY FIRE AND THE FIRE WILL TEST WHAT SORT OF WORK EACH ONE HAS DONE

IF THE WORK THAT ANYONE HAS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION SURVIVES HE WILL RECEIVE A REWARD

IF ANYONE'S WORK IS BURNED UP HE WILL SUFFER LOSS THOUGH HE HIMSELF WILL BE SAVED BUT ONLY AS THROUGH FIRE

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOD'S TEMPLE AND THAT GOD'S SPIRIT DWELLS IN YOU

IF ANYONE DESTROYS GOD'S TEMPLE GOD WILL DESTROY HIM

FOR GOD'S TEMPLE IS HOLY AND YOU ARE THAT TEMPLE

LET NO ONE DECEIVE HIMSELF

IF ANYONE AMONG YOU THINKS THAT HE IS WISE IN THIS AGE LET HIM BECOME A FOOL THAT HE MAY BECOME WISE

FOR THE WISDOM OF THIS WORLD IS FOLLY WITH GOD

FOR IT IS WRITTEN HE CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS AND AGAIN THE LORD KNOWS THE THOUGHTS OF THE WISE THAT THEY ARE FUTILE

 SO LET NO ONE BOAST IN MEN

FOR ALL THINGS ARE YOURS WHETHER PAUL OR APOLLOS OR CEPHAS OR THE WORLD OR LIFE OR DEATH OR THE PRESENT OR THE FUTUREALL ARE YOURS AND YOU ARE CHRIST'S AND CHRIST IS GOD'S

THIS IS HOW ONE SHOULD REGARD US AS SERVANTS OF CHRIST AND STEWARDS OF THE MYSTERIES OF GOD

MOREOVER IT IS REQUIRED OF STEWARDS THAT THEY BE FOUND TRUSTWORTHY

BUT WITH ME IT IS A VERY SMALL THING THAT I SHOULD BE JUDGED BY YOU OR BY ANY HUMAN COURT

IN FACT I DO NOT EVEN JUDGE MYSELF

I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING AGAINST MYSELF BUT I AM NOT THEREBY ACQUITTED

IT IS THE LORD WHO JUDGES ME

THEREFORE DO NOT PRONOUNCE JUDGMENT BEFORE THE TIME BEFORE THE LORD COMES WHO WILL BRING TO LIGHT THE THINGS NOW HIDDEN IN DARKNESS AND WILL DISCLOSE THE PURPOSES OF THE HEART

THEN EACH ONE WILL RECEIVE HIS COMMENDATION FROM GOD

I HAVE APPLIED ALL THESE THINGS TO MYSELF AND APOLLOS FOR YOUR BENEFIT BROTHERS THAT YOU MAY LEARN BY US NOT TO GO BEYOND WHAT IS WRITTEN THAT NONE OF YOU MAY BE PUFFED UP IN FAVOR OF ONE AGAINST ANOTHER

FOR WHO SEES ANYTHING DIFFERENT IN YOU

WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU DID NOT RECEIVE

IF THEN YOU RECEIVED IT WHY DO YOU BOAST AS IF YOU DID NOT RECEIVE IT

ALREADY YOU HAVE ALL YOU WANT

ALREADY YOU HAVE BECOME RICH

WITHOUT US YOU HAVE BECOME KINGS

AND WOULD THAT YOU DID REIGN SO THAT WE MIGHT SHARE THE RULE WITH YOU

FOR I THINK THAT GOD HAS EXHIBITED US APOSTLES AS LAST OF ALL LIKE MEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME A SPECTACLE TO THE WORLD TO ANGELS AND TO MEN

WE ARE FOOLS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE BUT YOU ARE WISE IN CHRIST

WE ARE WEAK BUT YOU ARE STRONG

YOU ARE HELD IN HONOR BUT WE IN DISREPUTE

TO THE PRESENT HOUR WE HUNGER AND THIRST WE ARE POORLY DRESSED AND BUFFETED AND HOMELESS AND WE LABOR WORKING WITH OUR OWN HANDS

WHEN REVILED WE BLESS; WHEN PERSECUTED WE ENDURE; WHEN SLANDERED WE ENTREAT

WE HAVE BECOME AND ARE STILL LIKE THE SCUM OF THE WORLD THE REFUSE OF ALL THINGS

I DO NOT WRITE THESE THINGS TO MAKE YOU ASHAMED BUT TO ADMONISH YOU AS MY BELOVED CHILDREN

FOR THOUGH YOU HAVE COUNTLESS GUIDES IN CHRIST YOU DO NOT HAVE MANY FATHERS

FOR I BECAME YOUR FATHER IN CHRIST JESUS THROUGH THE GOSPEL

I URGE YOU THEN BE IMITATORS OF ME

THAT IS WHY I SENT YOU TIMOTHY MY BELOVED AND FAITHFUL CHILD IN THE LORD TO REMIND YOU OF MY WAYS IN CHRIST AS I TEACH THEM EVERYWHERE IN EVERY CHURCH

SOME ARE ARROGANT AS THOUGH I WERE NOT COMING TO YOU

BUT I WILL COME TO YOU SOON IF THE LORD WILLS AND I WILL FIND OUT NOT THE TALK OF THESE ARROGANT PEOPLE BUT THEIR POWER

FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD DOES NOT CONSIST IN TALK BUT IN POWER

WHAT DO YOU WISH

SHALL I COME TO YOU WITH A ROD OR WITH LOVE IN A SPIRIT OF GENTLENESS

IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED THAT THERE IS SEXUAL IMMORALITY AMONG YOU AND OF A KIND THAT IS NOT TOLERATED EVEN AMONG PAGANS FOR A MAN HAS HIS FATHER'S WIFE

AND YOU ARE ARROGANT

OUGHT YOU NOT RATHER TO MOURN

LET HIM WHO HAS DONE THIS BE REMOVED FROM AMONG YOU

FOR THOUGH ABSENT IN BODY I AM PRESENT IN SPIRIT; AND AS IF PRESENT I HAVE ALREADY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT ON THE ONE WHO DID SUCH A THING

WHEN YOU ARE ASSEMBLED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS AND MY SPIRIT IS PRESENT WITH THE POWER OF OUR LORD JESUS YOU ARE TO DELIVER THIS MAN TO SATAN FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FLESH SO THAT HIS SPIRIT MAY BE SAVED IN THE DAY OF THE LORD

YOUR BOASTING IS NOT GOOD

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENS THE WHOLE LUMP

CLEANSE OUT THE OLD LEAVEN THAT YOU MAY BE A NEW LUMP AS YOU REALLY ARE UNLEAVENED

FOR CHRIST OUR PASSOVER LAMB HAS BEEN SACRIFICED

LET US THEREFORE CELEBRATE THE FESTIVAL NOT WITH THE OLD LEAVEN THE LEAVEN OF MALICE AND EVIL BUT WITH THE UNLEAVENED BREAD OF SINCERITY AND TRUTH

I WROTE TO YOU IN MY LETTER NOT TO ASSOCIATE WITH SEXUALLY IMMORAL PEOPLE NOT AT ALL MEANING THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL OF THIS WORLD OR THE GREEDY AND SWINDLERS OR IDOLATERS SINCE THEN YOU WOULD NEED TO GO OUT OF THE WORLD

BUT NOW I AM WRITING TO YOU NOT TO ASSOCIATE WITH ANYONE WHO BEARS THE NAME OF BROTHER IF HE IS GUILTY OF SEXUAL IMMORALITY OR GREED OR IS AN IDOLATER REVILER DRUNKARD OR SWINDLERNOT EVEN TO EAT WITH SUCH A ONE

FOR WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH JUDGING OUTSIDERS

IS IT NOT THOSE INSIDE THE CHURCH WHOM YOU ARE TO JUDGE

GOD JUDGES THOSE OUTSIDE

PURGE THE EVIL PERSON FROM AMONG YOU

WHEN ONE OF YOU HAS A GRIEVANCE AGAINST ANOTHER DOES HE DARE GO TO LAW BEFORE THE UNRIGHTEOUS INSTEAD OF THE SAINTS

OR DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE SAINTS WILL JUDGE THE WORLD

AND IF THE WORLD IS TO BE JUDGED BY YOU ARE YOU INCOMPETENT TO TRY TRIVIAL CASES

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT WE ARE TO JUDGE ANGELS

HOW MUCH MORE THEN MATTERS PERTAINING TO THIS LIFE

SO IF YOU HAVE SUCH CASES WHY DO YOU LAY THEM BEFORE THOSE WHO HAVE NO STANDING IN THE CHURCH

I SAY THIS TO YOUR SHAME

CAN IT BE THAT THERE IS NO ONE AMONG YOU WISE ENOUGH TO SETTLE A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE BROTHERS BUT BROTHER GOES TO LAW AGAINST BROTHER AND THAT BEFORE UNBELIEVERS

TO HAVE LAWSUITS AT ALL WITH ONE ANOTHER IS ALREADY A DEFEAT FOR YOU

WHY NOT RATHER SUFFER WRONG

WHY NOT RATHER BE DEFRAUDED

BUT YOU YOURSELVES WRONG AND DEFRAUDEVEN YOUR OWN BROTHERS

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE UNRIGHTEOUS WILL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD

DO NOT BE DECEIVED NEITHER THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL NOR IDOLATERS NOR ADULTERERS NOR MEN WHO PRACTICE HOMOSEXUALITY NOR THIEVES NOR THE GREEDY NOR DRUNKARDS NOR REVILERS NOR SWINDLERS WILL INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD

AND SUCH WERE SOME OF YOU

BUT YOU WERE WASHED YOU WERE SANCTIFIED YOU WERE JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND BY THE SPIRIT OF OUR GOD

ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL FOR ME BUT NOT ALL THINGS ARE HELPFUL

ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL FOR ME BUT I WILL NOT BE ENSLAVED BY ANYTHING

FOOD IS MEANT FOR THE STOMACH AND THE STOMACH FOR FOODAND GOD WILL DESTROY BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER

THE BODY IS NOT MEANT FOR SEXUAL IMMORALITY BUT FOR THE LORD AND THE LORD FOR THE BODY

AND GOD RAISED THE LORD AND WILL ALSO RAISE US UP BY HIS POWER

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOUR BODIES ARE MEMBERS OF CHRIST

SHALL I THEN TAKE THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST AND MAKE THEM MEMBERS OF A PROSTITUTE

NEVER

OR DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT HE WHO IS JOINED TO A PROSTITUTE BECOMES ONE BODY WITH HER

FOR AS IT IS WRITTEN THE TWO WILL BECOME ONE FLESH

 BUT HE WHO IS JOINED TO THE LORD BECOMES ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM

FLEE FROM SEXUAL IMMORALITY

EVERY OTHER SIN A PERSON COMMITS IS OUTSIDE THE BODY BUT THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL PERSON SINS AGAINST HIS OWN BODY

OR DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOUR BODY IS A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU WHOM YOU HAVE FROM GOD

YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN FOR YOU WERE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE

SO GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY

NOW CONCERNING THE MATTERS ABOUT WHICH YOU WROTE IT IS GOOD FOR A MAN NOT TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH A WOMAN

 BUT BECAUSE OF THE TEMPTATION TO SEXUAL IMMORALITY EACH MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS OWN WIFE AND EACH WOMAN HER OWN HUSBAND

THE HUSBAND SHOULD GIVE TO HIS WIFE HER CONJUGAL RIGHTS AND LIKEWISE THE WIFE TO HER HUSBAND

FOR THE WIFE DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER HER OWN BODY BUT THE HUSBAND DOES

LIKEWISE THE HUSBAND DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER HIS OWN BODY BUT THE WIFE DOES

DO NOT DEPRIVE ONE ANOTHER EXCEPT PERHAPS BY AGREEMENT FOR A LIMITED TIME THAT YOU MAY DEVOTE YOURSELVES TO PRAYER; BUT THEN COME TOGETHER AGAIN SO THAT SATAN MAY NOT TEMPT YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR LACK OF SELFCONTROL

NOW AS A CONCESSION NOT A COMMAND I SAY THIS

I WISH THAT ALL WERE AS I MYSELF AM

BUT EACH HAS HIS OWN GIFT FROM GOD ONE OF ONE KIND AND ONE OF ANOTHER

TO THE UNMARRIED AND THE WIDOWS I SAY THAT IT IS GOOD FOR THEM TO REMAIN SINGLE AS I AM

BUT IF THEY CANNOT EXERCISE SELFCONTROL THEY SHOULD MARRY

FOR IT IS BETTER TO MARRY THAN TO BE AFLAME WITH PASSION

TO THE MARRIED I GIVE THIS CHARGE NOT I BUT THE LORD THE WIFE SHOULD NOT SEPARATE FROM HER HUSBAND BUT IF SHE DOES SHE SHOULD REMAIN UNMARRIED OR ELSE BE RECONCILED TO HER HUSBAND AND THE HUSBAND SHOULD NOT DIVORCE HIS WIFE

TO THE REST I SAY I NOT THE LORD THAT IF ANY BROTHER HAS A WIFE WHO IS AN UNBELIEVER AND SHE CONSENTS TO LIVE WITH HIM HE SHOULD NOT DIVORCE HER

IF ANY WOMAN HAS A HUSBAND WHO IS AN UNBELIEVER AND HE CONSENTS TO LIVE WITH HER SHE SHOULD NOT DIVORCE HIM

FOR THE UNBELIEVING HUSBAND IS MADE HOLY BECAUSE OF HIS WIFE AND THE UNBELIEVING WIFE IS MADE HOLY BECAUSE OF HER HUSBAND

OTHERWISE YOUR CHILDREN WOULD BE UNCLEAN BUT AS IT IS THEY ARE HOLY

BUT IF THE UNBELIEVING PARTNER SEPARATES LET IT BE SO

IN SUCH CASES THE BROTHER OR SISTER IS NOT ENSLAVED

GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO PEACE

WIFE HOW DO YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WILL SAVE YOUR HUSBAND

HUSBAND HOW DO YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WILL SAVE YOUR WIFE

ONLY LET EACH PERSON LEAD THE LIFE THAT THE LORD HAS ASSIGNED TO HIM AND TO WHICH GOD HAS CALLED HIM

THIS IS MY RULE IN ALL THE CHURCHES

WAS ANYONE AT THE TIME OF HIS CALL ALREADY CIRCUMCISED

LET HIM NOT SEEK TO REMOVE THE MARKS OF CIRCUMCISION

WAS ANYONE AT THE TIME OF HIS CALL UNCIRCUMCISED

LET HIM NOT SEEK CIRCUMCISION

FOR NEITHER CIRCUMCISION COUNTS FOR ANYTHING NOR UNCIRCUMCISION BUT KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD

EACH ONE SHOULD REMAIN IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH HE WAS CALLED

WERE YOU A SLAVE WHEN CALLED

DO NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT

BUT IF YOU CAN GAIN YOUR FREEDOM AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY

FOR HE WHO WAS CALLED IN THE LORD AS A SLAVE IS A FREEDMAN OF THE LORD

LIKEWISE HE WHO WAS FREE WHEN CALLED IS A SLAVE OF CHRIST

YOU WERE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE; DO NOT BECOME SLAVES OF MEN

SO BROTHERS IN WHATEVER CONDITION EACH WAS CALLED THERE LET HIM REMAIN WITH GOD

NOW CONCERNING THE BETROTHED I HAVE NO COMMAND FROM THE LORD BUT I GIVE MY JUDGMENT AS ONE WHO BY THE LORD'S MERCY IS TRUSTWORTHY

I THINK THAT IN VIEW OF THE PRESENT DISTRESS IT IS GOOD FOR A PERSON TO REMAIN AS HE IS

ARE YOU BOUND TO A WIFE

DO NOT SEEK TO BE FREE

ARE YOU FREE FROM A WIFE

DO NOT SEEK A WIFE

BUT IF YOU DO MARRY YOU HAVE NOT SINNED AND IF A BETROTHED WOMAN MARRIES SHE HAS NOT SINNED

YET THOSE WHO MARRY WILL HAVE WORLDLY TROUBLES AND I WOULD SPARE YOU THAT

THIS IS WHAT I MEAN BROTHERS THE APPOINTED TIME HAS GROWN VERY SHORT

FROM NOW ON LET THOSE WHO HAVE WIVES LIVE AS THOUGH THEY HAD NONE AND THOSE WHO MOURN AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT MOURNING AND THOSE WHO REJOICE AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT REJOICING AND THOSE WHO BUY AS THOUGH THEY HAD NO GOODS AND THOSE WHO DEAL WITH THE WORLD AS THOUGH THEY HAD NO DEALINGS WITH IT

FOR THE PRESENT FORM OF THIS WORLD IS PASSING AWAY

I WANT YOU TO BE FREE FROM ANXIETIES

THE UNMARRIED MAN IS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE THINGS OF THE LORD HOW TO PLEASE THE LORD

BUT THE MARRIED MAN IS ANXIOUS ABOUT WORLDLY THINGS HOW TO PLEASE HIS WIFE AND HIS INTERESTS ARE DIVIDED

AND THE UNMARRIED OR BETROTHED WOMAN IS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE THINGS OF THE LORD HOW TO BE HOLY IN BODY AND SPIRIT

BUT THE MARRIED WOMAN IS ANXIOUS ABOUT WORLDLY THINGS HOW TO PLEASE HER HUSBAND

I SAY THIS FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT NOT TO LAY ANY RESTRAINT UPON YOU BUT TO PROMOTE GOOD ORDER AND TO SECURE YOUR UNDIVIDED DEVOTION TO THE LORD

IF ANYONE THINKS THAT HE IS NOT BEHAVING PROPERLY TOWARD HIS BETROTHED IF HIS PASSIONS ARE STRONG AND IT HAS TO BE LET HIM DO AS HE WISHES LET THEM MARRYIT IS NO SIN

BUT WHOEVER IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN HIS HEART BEING UNDER NO NECESSITY BUT HAVING HIS DESIRE UNDER CONTROL AND HAS DETERMINED THIS IN HIS HEART TO KEEP HER AS HIS BETROTHED HE WILL DO WELL

SO THEN HE WHO MARRIES HIS BETROTHED DOES WELL AND HE WHO REFRAINS FROM MARRIAGE WILL DO EVEN BETTER

A WIFE IS BOUND TO HER HUSBAND AS LONG AS HE LIVES

BUT IF HER HUSBAND DIES SHE IS FREE TO BE MARRIED TO WHOM SHE WISHES ONLY IN THE LORD

YET IN MY JUDGMENT SHE IS HAPPIER IF SHE REMAINS AS SHE IS

AND I THINK THAT I TOO HAVE THE SPIRIT OF GOD

NOW CONCERNING FOOD OFFERED TO IDOLS WE KNOW THAT ALL OF US POSSESS KNOWLEDGE

 THIS KNOWLEDGE PUFFS UP BUT LOVE BUILDS UP

IF ANYONE IMAGINES THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING HE DOES NOT YET KNOW AS HE OUGHT TO KNOW

BUT IF ANYONE LOVES GOD HE IS KNOWN BY GOD

THEREFORE AS TO THE EATING OF FOOD OFFERED TO IDOLS WE KNOW THAT AN IDOL HAS NO REAL EXISTENCE AND THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT ONE

 FOR ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOCALLED GODS IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTHAS INDEED THERE ARE MANY GODS AND MANY LORDS YET FOR US THERE IS ONE GOD THE FATHER FROM WHOM ARE ALL THINGS AND FOR WHOM WE EXIST AND ONE LORD JESUS CHRIST THROUGH WHOM ARE ALL THINGS AND THROUGH WHOM WE EXIST

HOWEVER NOT ALL POSSESS THIS KNOWLEDGE

BUT SOME THROUGH FORMER ASSOCIATION WITH IDOLS EAT FOOD AS REALLY OFFERED TO AN IDOL AND THEIR CONSCIENCE BEING WEAK IS DEFILED

FOOD WILL NOT COMMEND US TO GOD

WE ARE NO WORSE OFF IF WE DO NOT EAT AND NO BETTER OFF IF WE DO

BUT TAKE CARE THAT THIS RIGHT OF YOURS DOES NOT SOMEHOW BECOME A STUMBLING BLOCK TO THE WEAK

FOR IF ANYONE SEES YOU WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE EATING IN AN IDOL'S TEMPLE WILL HE NOT BE ENCOURAGED IF HIS CONSCIENCE IS WEAK TO EAT FOOD OFFERED TO IDOLS

AND SO BY YOUR KNOWLEDGE THIS WEAK PERSON IS DESTROYED THE BROTHER FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED

THUS SINNING AGAINST YOUR BROTHERS AND WOUNDING THEIR CONSCIENCE WHEN IT IS WEAK YOU SIN AGAINST CHRIST

THEREFORE IF FOOD MAKES MY BROTHER STUMBLE I WILL NEVER EAT MEAT LEST I MAKE MY BROTHER STUMBLE

AM I NOT FREE

AM I NOT AN APOSTLE

HAVE I NOT SEEN JESUS OUR LORD

ARE NOT YOU MY WORKMANSHIP IN THE LORD

IF TO OTHERS I AM NOT AN APOSTLE AT LEAST I AM TO YOU FOR YOU ARE THE SEAL OF MY APOSTLESHIP IN THE LORD

THIS IS MY DEFENSE TO THOSE WHO WOULD EXAMINE ME

DO WE NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO EAT AND DRINK

DO WE NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE ALONG A BELIEVING WIFE AS DO THE OTHER APOSTLES AND THE BROTHERS OF THE LORD AND CEPHAS

OR IS IT ONLY BARNABAS AND I WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFRAIN FROM WORKING FOR A LIVING

WHO SERVES AS A SOLDIER AT HIS OWN EXPENSE

WHO PLANTS A VINEYARD WITHOUT EATING ANY OF ITS FRUIT

OR WHO TENDS A FLOCK WITHOUT GETTING SOME OF THE MILK

DO I SAY THESE THINGS ON HUMAN AUTHORITY

DOES NOT THE LAW SAY THE SAME

FOR IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE AN OX WHEN IT TREADS OUT THE GRAIN

 IS IT FOR OXEN THAT GOD IS CONCERNED

DOES HE NOT SPEAK ENTIRELY FOR OUR SAKE

IT WAS WRITTEN FOR OUR SAKE BECAUSE THE PLOWMAN SHOULD PLOW IN HOPE AND THE THRESHER THRESH IN HOPE OF SHARING IN THE CROP

IF WE HAVE SOWN SPIRITUAL THINGS AMONG YOU IS IT TOO MUCH IF WE REAP MATERIAL THINGS FROM YOU

IF OTHERS SHARE THIS RIGHTFUL CLAIM ON YOU DO NOT WE EVEN MORE

NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE NOT MADE USE OF THIS RIGHT BUT WE ENDURE ANYTHING RATHER THAN PUT AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THE TEMPLE SERVICE GET THEIR FOOD FROM THE TEMPLE AND THOSE WHO SERVE AT THE ALTAR SHARE IN THE SACRIFICIAL OFFERINGS

IN THE SAME WAY THE LORD COMMANDED THAT THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THE GOSPEL SHOULD GET THEIR LIVING BY THE GOSPEL

BUT I HAVE MADE NO USE OF ANY OF THESE RIGHTS NOR AM I WRITING THESE THINGS TO SECURE ANY SUCH PROVISION

FOR I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN HAVE ANYONE DEPRIVE ME OF MY GROUND FOR BOASTING

FOR IF I PREACH THE GOSPEL THAT GIVES ME NO GROUND FOR BOASTING

FOR NECESSITY IS LAID UPON ME

WOE TO ME IF I DO NOT PREACH THE GOSPEL

FOR IF I DO THIS OF MY OWN WILL I HAVE A REWARD BUT NOT OF MY OWN WILL I AM STILL ENTRUSTED WITH A STEWARDSHIP

WHAT THEN IS MY REWARD

THAT IN MY PREACHING I MAY PRESENT THE GOSPEL FREE OF CHARGE SO AS NOT TO MAKE FULL USE OF MY RIGHT IN THE GOSPEL

FOR THOUGH I AM FREE FROM ALL I HAVE MADE MYSELF A SERVANT TO ALL THAT I MIGHT WIN MORE OF THEM

TO THE JEWS I BECAME AS A JEW IN ORDER TO WIN JEWS

TO THOSE UNDER THE LAW I BECAME AS ONE UNDER THE LAW THOUGH NOT BEING MYSELF UNDER THE LAW THAT I MIGHT WIN THOSE UNDER THE LAW

TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE LAW I BECAME AS ONE OUTSIDE THE LAW NOT BEING OUTSIDE THE LAW OF GOD BUT UNDER THE LAW OF CHRIST THAT I MIGHT WIN THOSE OUTSIDE THE LAW

TO THE WEAK I BECAME WEAK THAT I MIGHT WIN THE WEAK

I HAVE BECOME ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE THAT BY ALL MEANS I MIGHT SAVE SOME

I DO IT ALL FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL THAT I MAY SHARE WITH THEM IN ITS BLESSINGS

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IN A RACE ALL THE RUNNERS COMPETE BUT ONLY ONE RECEIVES THE PRIZE

SO RUN THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN IT

EVERY ATHLETE EXERCISES SELFCONTROL IN ALL THINGS

THEY DO IT TO RECEIVE A PERISHABLE WREATH BUT WE AN IMPERISHABLE

SO I DO NOT RUN AIMLESSLY; I DO NOT BOX AS ONE BEATING THE AIR

BUT I DISCIPLINE MY BODY AND KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL LEST AFTER PREACHING TO OTHERS I MYSELF SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED

I WANT YOU TO KNOW BROTHERS THAT OUR FATHERS WERE ALL UNDER THE CLOUD AND ALL PASSED THROUGH THE SEA AND ALL WERE BAPTIZED INTO MOSES IN THE CLOUD AND IN THE SEA AND ALL ATE THE SAME SPIRITUAL FOOD AND ALL DRANK THE SAME SPIRITUAL DRINK

FOR THEY DRANK FROM THE SPIRITUAL ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM AND THE ROCK WAS CHRIST

NEVERTHELESS WITH MOST OF THEM GOD WAS NOT PLEASED FOR THEY WERE OVERTHROWN IN THE WILDERNESS

NOW THESE THINGS TOOK PLACE AS EXAMPLES FOR US THAT WE MIGHT NOT DESIRE EVIL AS THEY DID

DO NOT BE IDOLATERS AS SOME OF THEM WERE; AS IT IS WRITTEN THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK AND ROSE UP TO PLAY

 WE MUST NOT INDULGE IN SEXUAL IMMORALITY AS SOME OF THEM DID AND TWENTYTHREE THOUSAND FELL IN A SINGLE DAY

WE MUST NOT PUT CHRIST TO THE TEST AS SOME OF THEM DID AND WERE DESTROYED BY SERPENTS NOR GRUMBLE AS SOME OF THEM DID AND WERE DESTROYED BY THE DESTROYER

NOW THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO THEM AS AN EXAMPLE BUT THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN FOR OUR INSTRUCTION ON WHOM THE END OF THE AGES HAS COME

THEREFORE LET ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT HE STANDS TAKE HEED LEST HE FALL

NO TEMPTATION HAS OVERTAKEN YOU THAT IS NOT COMMON TO MAN

GOD IS FAITHFUL AND HE WILL NOT LET YOU BE TEMPTED BEYOND YOUR ABILITY BUT WITH THE TEMPTATION HE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE WAY OF ESCAPE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ENDURE IT

THEREFORE MY BELOVED FLEE FROM IDOLATRY

I SPEAK AS TO SENSIBLE PEOPLE; JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT I SAY

THE CUP OF BLESSING THAT WE BLESS IS IT NOT A PARTICIPATION IN THE BLOOD OF CHRIST

THE BREAD THAT WE BREAK IS IT NOT A PARTICIPATION IN THE BODY OF CHRIST

BECAUSE THERE IS ONE BREAD WE WHO ARE MANY ARE ONE BODY FOR WE ALL PARTAKE OF THE ONE BREAD

CONSIDER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ARE NOT THOSE WHO EAT THE SACRIFICES PARTICIPANTS IN THE ALTAR

WHAT DO I IMPLY THEN

THAT FOOD OFFERED TO IDOLS IS ANYTHING OR THAT AN IDOL IS ANYTHING

NO I IMPLY THAT WHAT PAGANS SACRIFICE THEY OFFER TO DEMONS AND NOT TO GOD

I DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE PARTICIPANTS WITH DEMONS

YOU CANNOT DRINK THE CUP OF THE LORD AND THE CUP OF DEMONS

YOU CANNOT PARTAKE OF THE TABLE OF THE LORD AND THE TABLE OF DEMONS

SHALL WE PROVOKE THE LORD TO JEALOUSY

ARE WE STRONGER THAN HE

ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL BUT NOT ALL THINGS ARE HELPFUL

ALL THINGS ARE LAWFUL BUT NOT ALL THINGS BUILD UP

LET NO ONE SEEK HIS OWN GOOD BUT THE GOOD OF HIS NEIGHBOR

EAT WHATEVER IS SOLD IN THE MEAT MARKET WITHOUT RAISING ANY QUESTION ON THE GROUND OF CONSCIENCE

FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S AND THE FULLNESS THEREOF

 IF ONE OF THE UNBELIEVERS INVITES YOU TO DINNER AND YOU ARE DISPOSED TO GO EAT WHATEVER IS SET BEFORE YOU WITHOUT RAISING ANY QUESTION ON THE GROUND OF CONSCIENCE

BUT IF SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU THIS HAS BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE THEN DO NOT EAT IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE WHO INFORMED YOU AND FOR THE SAKE OF CONSCIENCE I DO NOT MEAN YOUR CONSCIENCE BUT HIS

FOR WHY SHOULD MY LIBERTY BE DETERMINED BY SOMEONE ELSE'S CONSCIENCE

IF I PARTAKE WITH THANKFULNESS WHY AM I DENOUNCED BECAUSE OF THAT FOR WHICH I GIVE THANKS

SO WHETHER YOU EAT OR DRINK OR WHATEVER YOU DO DO ALL TO THE GLORY OF GOD

GIVE NO OFFENSE TO JEWS OR TO GREEKS OR TO THE CHURCH OF GOD JUST AS I TRY TO PLEASE EVERYONE IN EVERYTHING I DO NOT SEEKING MY OWN ADVANTAGE BUT THAT OF MANY THAT THEY MAY BE SAVED

BE IMITATORS OF ME AS I AM OF CHRIST

NOW I COMMEND YOU BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER ME IN EVERYTHING AND MAINTAIN THE TRADITIONS EVEN AS I DELIVERED THEM TO YOU

BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN IS CHRIST THE HEAD OF A WIFE IS HER HUSBAND AND THE HEAD OF CHRIST IS GOD

EVERY MAN WHO PRAYS OR PROPHESIES WITH HIS HEAD COVERED DISHONORS HIS HEAD BUT EVERY WIFE WHO PRAYS OR PROPHESIES WITH HER HEAD UNCOVERED DISHONORS HER HEADIT IS THE SAME AS IF HER HEAD WERE SHAVEN

FOR IF A WIFE WILL NOT COVER HER HEAD THEN SHE SHOULD CUT HER HAIR SHORT

BUT SINCE IT IS DISGRACEFUL FOR A WIFE TO CUT OFF HER HAIR OR SHAVE HER HEAD LET HER COVER HER HEAD

FOR A MAN OUGHT NOT TO COVER HIS HEAD SINCE HE IS THE IMAGE AND GLORY OF GOD BUT WOMAN IS THE GLORY OF MAN

FOR MAN WAS NOT MADE FROM WOMAN BUT WOMAN FROM MAN

NEITHER WAS MAN CREATED FOR WOMAN BUT WOMAN FOR MAN

THAT IS WHY A WIFE OUGHT TO HAVE A SYMBOL OF AUTHORITY ON HER HEAD BECAUSE OF THE ANGELS

NEVERTHELESS IN THE LORD WOMAN IS NOT INDEPENDENT OF MAN NOR MAN OF WOMAN; FOR AS WOMAN WAS MADE FROM MAN SO MAN IS NOW BORN OF WOMAN

AND ALL THINGS ARE FROM GOD

JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES IS IT PROPER FOR A WIFE TO PRAY TO GOD WITH HER HEAD UNCOVERED

DOES NOT NATURE ITSELF TEACH YOU THAT IF A MAN WEARS LONG HAIR IT IS A DISGRACE FOR HIM BUT IF A WOMAN HAS LONG HAIR IT IS HER GLORY

FOR HER HAIR IS GIVEN TO HER FOR A COVERING

IF ANYONE IS INCLINED TO BE CONTENTIOUS WE HAVE NO SUCH PRACTICE NOR DO THE CHURCHES OF GOD

BUT IN THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS I DO NOT COMMEND YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER IT IS NOT FOR THE BETTER BUT FOR THE WORSE

FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER AS A CHURCH I HEAR THAT THERE ARE DIVISIONS AMONG YOU

AND I BELIEVE IT IN PART FOR THERE MUST BE FACTIONS AMONG YOU IN ORDER THAT THOSE WHO ARE GENUINE AMONG YOU MAY BE RECOGNIZED

WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER IT IS NOT THE LORD'S SUPPER THAT YOU EAT

FOR IN EATING EACH ONE GOES AHEAD WITH HIS OWN MEAL

ONE GOES HUNGRY ANOTHER GETS DRUNK

WHAT

DO YOU NOT HAVE HOUSES TO EAT AND DRINK IN

OR DO YOU DESPISE THE CHURCH OF GOD AND HUMILIATE THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING

WHAT SHALL I SAY TO YOU

SHALL I COMMEND YOU IN THIS

NO I WILL NOT

FOR I RECEIVED FROM THE LORD WHAT I ALSO DELIVERED TO YOU THAT THE LORD JESUS ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE WAS BETRAYED TOOK BREAD AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THANKS HE BROKE IT AND SAID THIS IS MY BODY WHICH IS FOR YOU

DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME

 IN THE SAME WAY ALSO HE TOOK THE CUP AFTER SUPPER SAYING THIS CUP IS THE NEW COVENANT IN MY BLOOD

DO THIS AS OFTEN AS YOU DRINK IT IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME

 FOR AS OFTEN AS YOU EAT THIS BREAD AND DRINK THE CUP YOU PROCLAIM THE LORD'S DEATH UNTIL HE COMES

WHOEVER THEREFORE EATS THE BREAD OR DRINKS THE CUP OF THE LORD IN AN UNWORTHY MANNER WILL BE GUILTY OF PROFANING THE BODY AND BLOOD OF THE LORD

LET A PERSON EXAMINE HIMSELF THEN AND SO EAT OF THE BREAD AND DRINK OF THE CUP

FOR ANYONE WHO EATS AND DRINKS WITHOUT DISCERNING THE BODY EATS AND DRINKS JUDGMENT ON HIMSELF

THAT IS WHY MANY OF YOU ARE WEAK AND ILL AND SOME HAVE DIED

BUT IF WE JUDGED OURSELVES TRULY WE WOULD NOT BE JUDGED

BUT WHEN WE ARE JUDGED BY THE LORD WE ARE DISCIPLINED SO THAT WE MAY NOT BE CONDEMNED ALONG WITH THE WORLD

SO THEN MY BROTHERS WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER TO EAT WAIT FOR ONE ANOTHER IF ANYONE IS HUNGRY LET HIM EAT AT HOMESO THAT WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER IT WILL NOT BE FOR JUDGMENT

ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS I WILL GIVE DIRECTIONS WHEN I COME

NOW CONCERNING SPIRITUAL GIFTS BROTHERS I DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE UNINFORMED

YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU WERE PAGANS YOU WERE LED ASTRAY TO MUTE IDOLS HOWEVER YOU WERE LED

THEREFORE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO ONE SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD EVER SAYS JESUS IS ACCURSED

 AND NO ONE CAN SAY JESUS IS LORD EXCEPT IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

NOW THERE ARE VARIETIES OF GIFTS BUT THE SAME SPIRIT; AND THERE ARE VARIETIES OF SERVICE BUT THE SAME LORD; AND THERE ARE VARIETIES OF ACTIVITIES BUT IT IS THE SAME GOD WHO EMPOWERS THEM ALL IN EVERYONE

TO EACH IS GIVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT FOR THE COMMON GOOD

TO ONE IS GIVEN THROUGH THE SPIRIT THE UTTERANCE OF WISDOM AND TO ANOTHER THE UTTERANCE OF KNOWLEDGE ACCORDING TO THE SAME SPIRIT TO ANOTHER FAITH BY THE SAME SPIRIT TO ANOTHER GIFTS OF HEALING BY THE ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER THE WORKING OF MIRACLES TO ANOTHER PROPHECY TO ANOTHER THE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SPIRITS TO ANOTHER VARIOUS KINDS OF TONGUES TO ANOTHER THE INTERPRETATION OF TONGUES

ALL THESE ARE EMPOWERED BY ONE AND THE SAME SPIRIT WHO APPORTIONS TO EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY AS HE WILLS

FOR JUST AS THE BODY IS ONE AND HAS MANY MEMBERS AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY THOUGH MANY ARE ONE BODY SO IT IS WITH CHRIST

FOR IN ONE SPIRIT WE WERE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODYJEWS OR GREEKS SLAVES OR FREEAND ALL WERE MADE TO DRINK OF ONE SPIRIT

FOR THE BODY DOES NOT CONSIST OF ONE MEMBER BUT OF MANY

IF THE FOOT SHOULD SAY BECAUSE I AM NOT A HAND I DO NOT BELONG TO THE BODY THAT WOULD NOT MAKE IT ANY LESS A PART OF THE BODY

AND IF THE EAR SHOULD SAY BECAUSE I AM NOT AN EYE I DO NOT BELONG TO THE BODY THAT WOULD NOT MAKE IT ANY LESS A PART OF THE BODY

IF THE WHOLE BODY WERE AN EYE WHERE WOULD BE THE SENSE OF HEARING

IF THE WHOLE BODY WERE AN EAR WHERE WOULD BE THE SENSE OF SMELL

BUT AS IT IS GOD ARRANGED THE MEMBERS IN THE BODY EACH ONE OF THEM AS HE CHOSE

IF ALL WERE A SINGLE MEMBER WHERE WOULD THE BODY BE

AS IT IS THERE ARE MANY PARTS YET ONE BODY

THE EYE CANNOT SAY TO THE HAND I HAVE NO NEED OF YOU NOR AGAIN THE HEAD TO THE FEET I HAVE NO NEED OF YOU

 ON THE CONTRARY THE PARTS OF THE BODY THAT SEEM TO BE WEAKER ARE INDISPENSABLE AND ON THOSE PARTS OF THE BODY THAT WE THINK LESS HONORABLE WE BESTOW THE GREATER HONOR AND OUR UNPRESENTABLE PARTS ARE TREATED WITH GREATER MODESTY WHICH OUR MORE PRESENTABLE PARTS DO NOT REQUIRE

BUT GOD HAS SO COMPOSED THE BODY GIVING GREATER HONOR TO THE PART THAT LACKED IT THAT THERE MAY BE NO DIVISION IN THE BODY BUT THAT THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE THE SAME CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER

IF ONE MEMBER SUFFERS ALL SUFFER TOGETHER; IF ONE MEMBER IS HONORED ALL REJOICE TOGETHER

NOW YOU ARE THE BODY OF CHRIST AND INDIVIDUALLY MEMBERS OF IT

AND GOD HAS APPOINTED IN THE CHURCH FIRST APOSTLES SECOND PROPHETS THIRD TEACHERS THEN MIRACLES THEN GIFTS OF HEALING HELPING ADMINISTRATING AND VARIOUS KINDS OF TONGUES

ARE ALL APOSTLES

ARE ALL PROPHETS

ARE ALL TEACHERS

DO ALL WORK MIRACLES

DO ALL POSSESS GIFTS OF HEALING

DO ALL SPEAK WITH TONGUES

DO ALL INTERPRET

BUT EARNESTLY DESIRE THE HIGHER GIFTS

AND I WILL SHOW YOU A STILL MORE EXCELLENT WAY

IF I SPEAK IN THE TONGUES OF MEN AND OF ANGELS BUT HAVE NOT LOVE I AM A NOISY GONG OR A CLANGING CYMBAL

AND IF I HAVE PROPHETIC POWERS AND UNDERSTAND ALL MYSTERIES AND ALL KNOWLEDGE AND IF I HAVE ALL FAITH SO AS TO REMOVE MOUNTAINS BUT HAVE NOT LOVE I AM NOTHING

IF I GIVE AWAY ALL I HAVE AND IF I DELIVER UP MY BODY TO BE BURNED BUT HAVE NOT LOVE I GAIN NOTHING

LOVE IS PATIENT AND KIND; LOVE DOES NOT ENVY OR BOAST; IT IS NOT ARROGANT OR RUDE

IT DOES NOT INSIST ON ITS OWN WAY; IT IS NOT IRRITABLE OR RESENTFUL; IT DOES NOT REJOICE AT WRONGDOING BUT REJOICES WITH THE TRUTH

LOVE BEARS ALL THINGS BELIEVES ALL THINGS HOPES ALL THINGS ENDURES ALL THINGS

LOVE NEVER ENDS

AS FOR PROPHECIES THEY WILL PASS AWAY; AS FOR TONGUES THEY WILL CEASE; AS FOR KNOWLEDGE IT WILL PASS AWAY

FOR WE KNOW IN PART AND WE PROPHESY IN PART BUT WHEN THE PERFECT COMES THE PARTIAL WILL PASS AWAY

WHEN I WAS A CHILD I SPOKE LIKE A CHILD I THOUGHT LIKE A CHILD I REASONED LIKE A CHILD

WHEN I BECAME A MAN I GAVE UP CHILDISH WAYS

FOR NOW WE SEE IN A MIRROR DIMLY BUT THEN FACE TO FACE

NOW I KNOW IN PART; THEN I SHALL KNOW FULLY EVEN AS I HAVE BEEN FULLY KNOWN

SO NOW FAITH HOPE AND LOVE ABIDE THESE THREE; BUT THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE

PURSUE LOVE AND EARNESTLY DESIRE THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS ESPECIALLY THAT YOU MAY PROPHESY

FOR ONE WHO SPEAKS IN A TONGUE SPEAKS NOT TO MEN BUT TO GOD; FOR NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HE UTTERS MYSTERIES IN THE SPIRIT

ON THE OTHER HAND THE ONE WHO PROPHESIES SPEAKS TO PEOPLE FOR THEIR UPBUILDING AND ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONSOLATION

THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IN A TONGUE BUILDS UP HIMSELF BUT THE ONE WHO PROPHESIES BUILDS UP THE CHURCH

NOW I WANT YOU ALL TO SPEAK IN TONGUES BUT EVEN MORE TO PROPHESY

THE ONE WHO PROPHESIES IS GREATER THAN THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IN TONGUES UNLESS SOMEONE INTERPRETS SO THAT THE CHURCH MAY BE BUILT UP

NOW BROTHERS IF I COME TO YOU SPEAKING IN TONGUES HOW WILL I BENEFIT YOU UNLESS I BRING YOU SOME REVELATION OR KNOWLEDGE OR PROPHECY OR TEACHING

IF EVEN LIFELESS INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE FLUTE OR THE HARP DO NOT GIVE DISTINCT NOTES HOW WILL ANYONE KNOW WHAT IS PLAYED

AND IF THE BUGLE GIVES AN INDISTINCT SOUND WHO WILL GET READY FOR BATTLE

SO WITH YOURSELVES IF WITH YOUR TONGUE YOU UTTER SPEECH THAT IS NOT INTELLIGIBLE HOW WILL ANYONE KNOW WHAT IS SAID

FOR YOU WILL BE SPEAKING INTO THE AIR

THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN THE WORLD AND NONE IS WITHOUT MEANING BUT IF I DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THE LANGUAGE I WILL BE A FOREIGNER TO THE SPEAKER AND THE SPEAKER A FOREIGNER TO ME

SO WITH YOURSELVES SINCE YOU ARE EAGER FOR MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SPIRIT STRIVE TO EXCEL IN BUILDING UP THE CHURCH

THEREFORE ONE WHO SPEAKS IN A TONGUE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE POWER TO INTERPRET

FOR IF I PRAY IN A TONGUE MY SPIRIT PRAYS BUT MY MIND IS UNFRUITFUL

WHAT AM I TO DO

I WILL PRAY WITH MY SPIRIT BUT I WILL PRAY WITH MY MIND ALSO; I WILL SING PRAISE WITH MY SPIRIT BUT I WILL SING WITH MY MIND ALSO

OTHERWISE IF YOU GIVE THANKS WITH YOUR SPIRIT HOW CAN ANYONE IN THE POSITION OF AN OUTSIDER SAY AMEN TO YOUR THANKSGIVING WHEN HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

FOR YOU MAY BE GIVING THANKS WELL ENOUGH BUT THE OTHER PERSON IS NOT BEING BUILT UP

I THANK GOD THAT I SPEAK IN TONGUES MORE THAN ALL OF YOU

NEVERTHELESS IN CHURCH I WOULD RATHER SPEAK FIVE WORDS WITH MY MIND IN ORDER TO INSTRUCT OTHERS THAN TEN THOUSAND WORDS IN A TONGUE

BROTHERS DO NOT BE CHILDREN IN YOUR THINKING

BE INFANTS IN EVIL BUT IN YOUR THINKING BE MATURE

IN THE LAW IT IS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF FOREIGNERS WILL I SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE AND EVEN THEN THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME SAYS THE LORD

 THUS TONGUES ARE A SIGN NOT FOR BELIEVERS BUT FOR UNBELIEVERS WHILE PROPHECY IS A SIGN NOT FOR UNBELIEVERS BUT FOR BELIEVERS

IF THEREFORE THE WHOLE CHURCH COMES TOGETHER AND ALL SPEAK IN TONGUES AND OUTSIDERS OR UNBELIEVERS ENTER WILL THEY NOT SAY THAT YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MINDS

BUT IF ALL PROPHESY AND AN UNBELIEVER OR OUTSIDER ENTERS HE IS CONVICTED BY ALL HE IS CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY ALL THE SECRETS OF HIS HEART ARE DISCLOSED AND SO FALLING ON HIS FACE HE WILL WORSHIP GOD AND DECLARE THAT GOD IS REALLY AMONG YOU

WHAT THEN BROTHERS

WHEN YOU COME TOGETHER EACH ONE HAS A HYMN A LESSON A REVELATION A TONGUE OR AN INTERPRETATION

LET ALL THINGS BE DONE FOR BUILDING UP

IF ANY SPEAK IN A TONGUE LET THERE BE ONLY TWO OR AT MOST THREE AND EACH IN TURN AND LET SOMEONE INTERPRET

BUT IF THERE IS NO ONE TO INTERPRET LET EACH OF THEM KEEP SILENT IN CHURCH AND SPEAK TO HIMSELF AND TO GOD

LET TWO OR THREE PROPHETS SPEAK AND LET THE OTHERS WEIGH WHAT IS SAID

IF A REVELATION IS MADE TO ANOTHER SITTING THERE LET THE FIRST BE SILENT

FOR YOU CAN ALL PROPHESY ONE BY ONE SO THAT ALL MAY LEARN AND ALL BE ENCOURAGED AND THE SPIRITS OF PROPHETS ARE SUBJECT TO PROPHETS

FOR GOD IS NOT A GOD OF CONFUSION BUT OF PEACE

AS IN ALL THE CHURCHES OF THE SAINTS THE WOMEN SHOULD KEEP SILENT IN THE CHURCHES

FOR THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK BUT SHOULD BE IN SUBMISSION AS THE LAW ALSO SAYS

IF THERE IS ANYTHING THEY DESIRE TO LEARN LET THEM ASK THEIR HUSBANDS AT HOME

FOR IT IS SHAMEFUL FOR A WOMAN TO SPEAK IN CHURCH

OR WAS IT FROM YOU THAT THE WORD OF GOD CAME

OR ARE YOU THE ONLY ONES IT HAS REACHED

IF ANYONE THINKS THAT HE IS A PROPHET OR SPIRITUAL HE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE THINGS I AM WRITING TO YOU ARE A COMMAND OF THE LORD

IF ANYONE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS HE IS NOT RECOGNIZED

SO MY BROTHERS EARNESTLY DESIRE TO PROPHESY AND DO NOT FORBID SPEAKING IN TONGUES

BUT ALL THINGS SHOULD BE DONE DECENTLY AND IN ORDER

NOW I WOULD REMIND YOU BROTHERS OF THE GOSPEL I PREACHED TO YOU WHICH YOU RECEIVED IN WHICH YOU STAND AND BY WHICH YOU ARE BEING SAVED IF YOU HOLD FAST TO THE WORD I PREACHED TO YOUUNLESS YOU BELIEVED IN VAIN

FOR I DELIVERED TO YOU AS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE WHAT I ALSO RECEIVED THAT CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCRIPTURES THAT HE WAS BURIED THAT HE WAS RAISED ON THE THIRD DAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCRIPTURES AND THAT HE APPEARED TO CEPHAS THEN TO THE TWELVE

THEN HE APPEARED TO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED BROTHERS AT ONE TIME MOST OF WHOM ARE STILL ALIVE THOUGH SOME HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP

THEN HE APPEARED TO JAMES THEN TO ALL THE APOSTLES

LAST OF ALL AS TO ONE UNTIMELY BORN HE APPEARED ALSO TO ME

FOR I AM THE LEAST OF THE APOSTLES UNWORTHY TO BE CALLED AN APOSTLE BECAUSE I PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF GOD

BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD I AM WHAT I AM AND HIS GRACE TOWARD ME WAS NOT IN VAIN

ON THE CONTRARY I WORKED HARDER THAN ANY OF THEM THOUGH IT WAS NOT I BUT THE GRACE OF GOD THAT IS WITH ME

WHETHER THEN IT WAS I OR THEY SO WE PREACH AND SO YOU BELIEVED

NOW IF CHRIST IS PROCLAIMED AS RAISED FROM THE DEAD HOW CAN SOME OF YOU SAY THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD

BUT IF THERE IS NO RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD THEN NOT EVEN CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED

AND IF CHRIST HAS NOT BEEN RAISED THEN OUR PREACHING IS IN VAIN AND YOUR FAITH IS IN VAIN

WE ARE EVEN FOUND TO BE MISREPRESENTING GOD BECAUSE WE TESTIFIED ABOUT GOD THAT HE RAISED CHRIST WHOM HE DID NOT RAISE IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE DEAD ARE NOT RAISED

FOR IF THE DEAD ARE NOT RAISED NOT EVEN CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED

AND IF CHRIST HAS NOT BEEN RAISED YOUR FAITH IS FUTILE AND YOU ARE STILL IN YOUR SINS

THEN THOSE ALSO WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP IN CHRIST HAVE PERISHED

IF IN THIS LIFE ONLY WE HAVE HOPED IN CHRIST WE ARE OF ALL PEOPLE MOST TO BE PITIED

BUT IN FACT CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP

FOR AS BY A MAN CAME DEATH BY A MAN HAS COME ALSO THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD

FOR AS IN ADAM ALL DIE SO ALSO IN CHRIST SHALL ALL BE MADE ALIVE

BUT EACH IN HIS OWN ORDER CHRIST THE FIRSTFRUITS THEN AT HIS COMING THOSE WHO BELONG TO CHRIST

THEN COMES THE END WHEN HE DELIVERS THE KINGDOM TO GOD THE FATHER AFTER DESTROYING EVERY RULE AND EVERY AUTHORITY AND POWER

FOR HE MUST REIGN UNTIL HE HAS PUT ALL HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS FEET

THE LAST ENEMY TO BE DESTROYED IS DEATH

FOR GOD HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET

 BUT WHEN IT SAYS ALL THINGS ARE PUT IN SUBJECTION IT IS PLAIN THAT HE IS EXCEPTED WHO PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIM

WHEN ALL THINGS ARE SUBJECTED TO HIM THEN THE SON HIMSELF WILL ALSO BE SUBJECTED TO HIM WHO PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIM THAT GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL

OTHERWISE WHAT DO PEOPLE MEAN BY BEING BAPTIZED ON BEHALF OF THE DEAD

IF THE DEAD ARE NOT RAISED AT ALL WHY ARE PEOPLE BAPTIZED ON THEIR BEHALF

WHY AM I IN DANGER EVERY HOUR

I PROTEST BROTHERS BY MY PRIDE IN YOU WHICH I HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD I DIE EVERY DAY

WHAT DO I GAIN IF HUMANLY SPEAKING I FOUGHT WITH BEASTS AT EPHESUS

IF THE DEAD ARE NOT RAISED LET US EAT AND DRINK FOR TOMORROW WE DIE

 DO NOT BE DECEIVED BAD COMPANY RUINS GOOD MORALS

 WAKE UP FROM YOUR DRUNKEN STUPOR AS IS RIGHT AND DO NOT GO ON SINNING

FOR SOME HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

I SAY THIS TO YOUR SHAME

BUT SOMEONE WILL ASK HOW ARE THE DEAD RAISED

WITH WHAT KIND OF BODY DO THEY COME

 YOU FOOLISH PERSON

WHAT YOU SOW DOES NOT COME TO LIFE UNLESS IT DIES

AND WHAT YOU SOW IS NOT THE BODY THAT IS TO BE BUT A BARE KERNEL PERHAPS OF WHEAT OR OF SOME OTHER GRAIN

BUT GOD GIVES IT A BODY AS HE HAS CHOSEN AND TO EACH KIND OF SEED ITS OWN BODY

FOR NOT ALL FLESH IS THE SAME BUT THERE IS ONE KIND FOR HUMANS ANOTHER FOR ANIMALS ANOTHER FOR BIRDS AND ANOTHER FOR FISH

THERE ARE HEAVENLY BODIES AND EARTHLY BODIES BUT THE GLORY OF THE HEAVENLY IS OF ONE KIND AND THE GLORY OF THE EARTHLY IS OF ANOTHER

THERE IS ONE GLORY OF THE SUN AND ANOTHER GLORY OF THE MOON AND ANOTHER GLORY OF THE STARS; FOR STAR DIFFERS FROM STAR IN GLORY

SO IS IT WITH THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD

WHAT IS SOWN IS PERISHABLE; WHAT IS RAISED IS IMPERISHABLE

IT IS SOWN IN DISHONOR; IT IS RAISED IN GLORY

IT IS SOWN IN WEAKNESS; IT IS RAISED IN POWER

IT IS SOWN A NATURAL BODY; IT IS RAISED A SPIRITUAL BODY

IF THERE IS A NATURAL BODY THERE IS ALSO A SPIRITUAL BODY

THUS IT IS WRITTEN THE FIRST MAN ADAM BECAME A LIVING BEING; THE LAST ADAM BECAME A LIFEGIVING SPIRIT

BUT IT IS NOT THE SPIRITUAL THAT IS FIRST BUT THE NATURAL AND THEN THE SPIRITUAL

THE FIRST MAN WAS FROM THE EARTH A MAN OF DUST; THE SECOND MAN IS FROM HEAVEN

AS WAS THE MAN OF DUST SO ALSO ARE THOSE WHO ARE OF THE DUST AND AS IS THE MAN OF HEAVEN SO ALSO ARE THOSE WHO ARE OF HEAVEN

JUST AS WE HAVE BORNE THE IMAGE OF THE MAN OF DUST WE SHALL ALSO BEAR THE IMAGE OF THE MAN OF HEAVEN

I TELL YOU THIS BROTHERS FLESH AND BLOOD CANNOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD NOR DOES THE PERISHABLE INHERIT THE IMPERISHABLE

BEHOLD

I TELL YOU A MYSTERY

WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP BUT WE SHALL ALL BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AT THE LAST TRUMPET

FOR THE TRUMPET WILL SOUND AND THE DEAD WILL BE RAISED IMPERISHABLE AND WE SHALL BE CHANGED

FOR THIS PERISHABLE BODY MUST PUT ON THE IMPERISHABLE AND THIS MORTAL BODY MUST PUT ON IMMORTALITY

WHEN THE PERISHABLE PUTS ON THE IMPERISHABLE AND THE MORTAL PUTS ON IMMORTALITY THEN SHALL COME TO PASS THE SAYING THAT IS WRITTEN DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP IN VICTORY

 O DEATH WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY

O DEATH WHERE IS YOUR STING

 THE STING OF DEATH IS SIN AND THE POWER OF SIN IS THE LAW

BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVES US THE VICTORY THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

THEREFORE MY BELOVED BROTHERS BE STEADFAST IMMOVABLE ALWAYS ABOUNDING IN THE WORK OF THE LORD KNOWING THAT IN THE LORD YOUR LABOR IS NOT IN VAIN

NOW CONCERNING THE COLLECTION FOR THE SAINTS AS I DIRECTED THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA SO YOU ALSO ARE TO DO

ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY WEEK EACH OF YOU IS TO PUT SOMETHING ASIDE AND STORE IT UP AS HE MAY PROSPER SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO COLLECTING WHEN I COME

EZRAIN THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD BY THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH MIGHT BE FULFILLED THE LORD STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA SO THAT HE MADE A PROCLAMATION THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM AND ALSO PUT IT IN WRITING THUS SAYS CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THE LORD THE GOD OF HEAVEN HAS GIVEN ME ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH AND HE HAS CHARGED ME TO BUILD HIM A HOUSE AT JERUSALEM WHICH IS IN JUDAH

ALSO OF THE SONS OF THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF HABAIAH THE SONS OF HAKKOZ AND THE SONS OF BARZILLAI WHO HAD TAKEN A WIFE FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF BARZILLAI THE GILEADITE AND WAS CALLED BY THEIR NAME

THESE SOUGHT THEIR REGISTRATION AMONG THOSE ENROLLED IN THE GENEALOGIES BUT THEY WERE NOT FOUND THERE AND SO THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD AS UNCLEAN

THE GOVERNOR TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE NOT TO PARTAKE OF THE MOST HOLY FOOD UNTIL THERE SHOULD BE A PRIEST TO CONSULT URIM AND THUMMIM

THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER WAS  BESIDES THEIR MALE AND FEMALE SERVANTS OF WHOM THERE WERE  AND THEY HAD  MALE AND FEMALE SINGERS

THEIR HORSES WERE  THEIR MULES WERE  THEIR CAMELS WERE  AND THEIR DONKEYS WERE 

SOME OF THE HEADS OF FAMILIES WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM MADE FREEWILL OFFERINGS FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD TO ERECT IT ON ITS SITE

ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY THEY GAVE TO THE TREASURY OF THE WORK  DARICS OF GOLD  MINAS OF SILVER AND  PRIESTS' GARMENTS

NOW THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES SOME OF THE PEOPLE THE SINGERS THE GATEKEEPERS AND THE TEMPLE SERVANTS LIVED IN THEIR TOWNS AND ALL THE REST OF ISRAEL IN THEIR TOWNS

WHEN THE SEVENTH MONTH CAME AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE IN THE TOWNS THE PEOPLE GATHERED AS ONE MAN TO JERUSALEM

THEN AROSE JESHUA THE SON OF JOZADAK WITH HIS FELLOW PRIESTS AND ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL WITH HIS KINSMEN AND THEY BUILT THE ALTAR OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS ON IT AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE LAW OF MOSES THE MAN OF GOD

THEY SET THE ALTAR IN ITS PLACE FOR FEAR WAS ON THEM BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLES OF THE LANDS AND THEY OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS ON IT TO THE LORD BURNT OFFERINGS MORNING AND EVENING

AND THEY KEPT THE FEAST OF BOOTHS AS IT IS WRITTEN AND OFFERED THE DAILY BURNT OFFERINGS BY NUMBER ACCORDING TO THE RULE AS EACH DAY REQUIRED AND AFTER THAT THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERINGS THE OFFERINGS AT THE NEW MOON AND AT ALL THE APPOINTED FEASTS OF THE LORD AND THE OFFERINGS OF EVERYONE WHO MADE A FREEWILL OFFERING TO THE LORD

FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH THEY BEGAN TO OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE LORD

BUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD WAS NOT YET LAID

SO THEY GAVE MONEY TO THE MASONS AND THE CARPENTERS AND FOOD DRINK AND OIL TO THE SIDONIANS AND THE TYRIANS TO BRING CEDAR TREES FROM LEBANON TO THE SEA TO JOPPA ACCORDING TO THE GRANT THAT THEY HAD FROM CYRUS KING OF PERSIA

NOW IN THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THEIR COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AT JERUSALEM IN THE SECOND MONTH ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL AND JESHUA THE SON OF JOZADAK MADE A BEGINNING TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THEIR KINSMEN THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND ALL WHO HAD COME TO JERUSALEM FROM THE CAPTIVITY

THEY APPOINTED THE LEVITES FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD TO SUPERVISE THE WORK OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND JESHUA WITH HIS SONS AND HIS BROTHERS AND KADMIEL AND HIS SONS THE SONS OF JUDAH TOGETHER SUPERVISED THE WORKMEN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD ALONG WITH THE SONS OF HENADAD AND THE LEVITES THEIR SONS AND BROTHERS

AND WHEN THE BUILDERS LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD THE PRIESTS IN THEIR VESTMENTS CAME FORWARD WITH TRUMPETS AND THE LEVITES THE SONS OF ASAPH WITH CYMBALS TO PRAISE THE LORD ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS OF DAVID KING OF ISRAEL

AND THEY SANG RESPONSIVELY PRAISING AND GIVING THANKS TO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER TOWARD ISRAEL

AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHOUTED WITH A GREAT SHOUT WHEN THEY PRAISED THE LORD BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WAS LAID

BUT MANY OF THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES AND HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES OLD MEN WHO HAD SEEN THE FIRST HOUSE WEPT WITH A LOUD VOICE WHEN THEY SAW THE FOUNDATION OF THIS HOUSE BEING LAID THOUGH MANY SHOUTED ALOUD FOR JOY SO THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THE SOUND OF THE JOYFUL SHOUT FROM THE SOUND OF THE PEOPLE'S WEEPING FOR THE PEOPLE SHOUTED WITH A GREAT SHOUT AND THE SOUND WAS HEARD FAR AWAY

NOW WHEN THE ADVERSARIES OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN HEARD THAT THE RETURNED EXILES WERE BUILDING A TEMPLE TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL THEY APPROACHED ZERUBBABEL AND THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES AND SAID TO THEM LET US BUILD WITH YOU FOR WE WORSHIP YOUR GOD AS YOU DO AND WE HAVE BEEN SACRIFICING TO HIM EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF ESARHADDON KING OF ASSYRIA WHO BROUGHT US HERE

 BUT ZERUBBABEL JESHUA AND THE REST OF THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES IN ISRAEL SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH US IN BUILDING A HOUSE TO OUR GOD; BUT WE ALONE WILL BUILD TO THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL AS KING CYRUS THE KING OF PERSIA HAS COMMANDED US

 THEN THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND DISCOURAGED THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH AND MADE THEM AFRAID TO BUILD AND BRIBED COUNSELORS AGAINST THEM TO FRUSTRATE THEIR PURPOSE ALL THE DAYS OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA EVEN UNTIL THE REIGN OF DARIUS KING OF PERSIA

AND IN THE REIGN OF AHASUERUS IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THEY WROTE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM

IN THE DAYS OF ARTAXERXES BISHLAM AND MITHREDATH AND TABEEL AND THE REST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES WROTE TO ARTAXERXES KING OF PERSIA

THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN ARAMAIC AND TRANSLATED

REHUM THE COMMANDER AND SHIMSHAI THE SCRIBE WROTE A LETTER AGAINST JERUSALEM TO ARTAXERXES THE KING AS FOLLOWS REHUM THE COMMANDER SHIMSHAI THE SCRIBE AND THE REST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES THE JUDGES THE GOVERNORS THE OFFICIALS THE PERSIANS THE MEN OF ERECH THE BABYLONIANS THE MEN OF SUSA THAT IS THE ELAMITES AND THE REST OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE GREAT AND NOBLE OSNAPPAR DEPORTED AND SETTLED IN THE CITIES OF SAMARIA AND IN THE REST OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER

THIS IS A COPY OF THE LETTER THAT THEY SENT

 TO ARTAXERXES THE KING YOUR SERVANTS THE MEN OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER SEND GREETING

AND NOW BE IT KNOWN TO THE KING THAT THE JEWS WHO CAME UP FROM YOU TO US HAVE GONE TO JERUSALEM

THEY ARE REBUILDING THAT REBELLIOUS AND WICKED CITY

THEY ARE FINISHING THE WALLS AND REPAIRING THE FOUNDATIONS

NOW BE IT KNOWN TO THE KING THAT IF THIS CITY IS REBUILT AND THE WALLS FINISHED THEY WILL NOT PAY TRIBUTE CUSTOM OR TOLL AND THE ROYAL REVENUE WILL BE IMPAIRED

NOW BECAUSE WE EAT THE SALT OF THE PALACE AND IT IS NOT FITTING FOR US TO WITNESS THE KING'S DISHONOR THEREFORE WE SEND AND INFORM THE KING IN ORDER THAT SEARCH MAY BE MADE IN THE BOOK OF THE RECORDS OF YOUR FATHERS

YOU WILL FIND IN THE BOOK OF THE RECORDS AND LEARN THAT THIS CITY IS A REBELLIOUS CITY HURTFUL TO KINGS AND PROVINCES AND THAT SEDITION WAS STIRRED UP IN IT FROM OF OLD

THAT WAS WHY THIS CITY WAS LAID WASTE

WE MAKE KNOWN TO THE KING THAT IF THIS CITY IS REBUILT AND ITS WALLS FINISHED YOU WILL THEN HAVE NO POSSESSION IN THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER

 THE KING SENT AN ANSWER TO REHUM THE COMMANDER AND SHIMSHAI THE SCRIBE AND THE REST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES WHO LIVE IN SAMARIA AND IN THE REST OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER GREETING

AND NOW THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT TO US HAS BEEN PLAINLY READ BEFORE ME

AND I MADE A DECREE AND SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE AND IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THIS CITY FROM OF OLD HAS RISEN AGAINST KINGS AND THAT REBELLION AND SEDITION HAVE BEEN MADE IN IT

AND MIGHTY KINGS HAVE BEEN OVER JERUSALEM WHO RULED OVER THE WHOLE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER TO WHOM TRIBUTE CUSTOM AND TOLL WERE PAID

THEREFORE MAKE A DECREE THAT THESE MEN BE MADE TO CEASE AND THAT THIS CITY BE NOT REBUILT UNTIL A DECREE IS MADE BY ME

AND TAKE CARE NOT TO BE SLACK IN THIS MATTER

WHY SHOULD DAMAGE GROW TO THE HURT OF THE KING

 THEN WHEN THE COPY OF KING ARTAXERXES' LETTER WAS READ BEFORE REHUM AND SHIMSHAI THE SCRIBE AND THEIR ASSOCIATES THEY WENT IN HASTE TO THE JEWS AT JERUSALEM AND BY FORCE AND POWER MADE THEM CEASE

THEN THE WORK ON THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM STOPPED AND IT CEASED UNTIL THE SECOND YEAR OF THE REIGN OF DARIUS KING OF PERSIA

NOW THE PROPHETS HAGGAI AND ZECHARIAH THE SON OF IDDO PROPHESIED TO THE JEWS WHO WERE IN JUDAH AND JERUSALEM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO WAS OVER THEM

THEN ZERUBBABEL THE SON OF SHEALTIEL AND JESHUA THE SON OF JOZADAK AROSE AND BEGAN TO REBUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM AND THE PROPHETS OF GOD WERE WITH THEM SUPPORTING THEM

AT THE SAME TIME TATTENAI THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER AND SHETHARBOZENAI AND THEIR ASSOCIATES CAME TO THEM AND SPOKE TO THEM THUS WHO GAVE YOU A DECREE TO BUILD THIS HOUSE AND TO FINISH THIS STRUCTURE

 THEY ALSO ASKED THEM THIS WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHO ARE BUILDING THIS BUILDING

 BUT THE EYE OF THEIR GOD WAS ON THE ELDERS OF THE JEWS AND THEY DID NOT STOP THEM UNTIL THE REPORT SHOULD REACH DARIUS AND THEN AN ANSWER BE RETURNED BY LETTER CONCERNING IT

THIS IS A COPY OF THE LETTER THAT TATTENAI THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER AND SHETHARBOZENAI AND HIS ASSOCIATES THE GOVERNORS WHO WERE IN THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER SENT TO DARIUS THE KING

THEY SENT HIM A REPORT IN WHICH WAS WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS TO DARIUS THE KING ALL PEACE

BE IT KNOWN TO THE KING THAT WE WENT TO THE PROVINCE OF JUDAH TO THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT GOD

IT IS BEING BUILT WITH HUGE STONES AND TIMBER IS LAID IN THE WALLS

THIS WORK GOES ON DILIGENTLY AND PROSPERS IN THEIR HANDS

THEN WE ASKED THOSE ELDERS AND SPOKE TO THEM THUS 'WHO GAVE YOU A DECREE TO BUILD THIS HOUSE AND TO FINISH THIS STRUCTURE

' WE ALSO ASKED THEM THEIR NAMES FOR YOUR INFORMATION THAT WE MIGHT WRITE DOWN THE NAMES OF THEIR LEADERS

AND THIS WAS THEIR REPLY TO US 'WE ARE THE SERVANTS OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND WE ARE REBUILDING THE HOUSE THAT WAS BUILT MANY YEARS AGO WHICH A GREAT KING OF ISRAEL BUILT AND FINISHED

BUT BECAUSE OUR FATHERS HAD ANGERED THE GOD OF HEAVEN HE GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON THE CHALDEAN WHO DESTROYED THIS HOUSE AND CARRIED AWAY THE PEOPLE TO BABYLONIA

HOWEVER IN THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS KING OF BABYLON CYRUS THE KING MADE A DECREE THAT THIS HOUSE OF GOD SHOULD BE REBUILT

AND THE GOLD AND SILVER VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR HAD TAKEN OUT OF THE TEMPLE THAT WAS IN JERUSALEM AND BROUGHT INTO THE TEMPLE OF BABYLON THESE CYRUS THE KING TOOK OUT OF THE TEMPLE OF BABYLON AND THEY WERE DELIVERED TO ONE WHOSE NAME WAS SHESHBAZZAR WHOM HE HAD MADE GOVERNOR; AND HE SAID TO HIM TAKE THESE VESSELS GO AND PUT THEM IN THE TEMPLE THAT IS IN JERUSALEM AND LET THE HOUSE OF GOD BE REBUILT ON ITS SITE

 THEN THIS SHESHBAZZAR CAME AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM AND FROM THAT TIME UNTIL NOW IT HAS BEEN IN BUILDING AND IT IS NOT YET FINISHED

' THEREFORE IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO THE KING LET SEARCH BE MADE IN THE ROYAL ARCHIVES THERE IN BABYLON TO SEE WHETHER A DECREE WAS ISSUED BY CYRUS THE KING FOR THE REBUILDING OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD IN JERUSALEM

AND LET THE KING SEND US HIS PLEASURE IN THIS MATTER

THEN DARIUS THE KING MADE A DECREE AND SEARCH WAS MADE IN BABYLONIA IN THE HOUSE OF THE ARCHIVES WHERE THE DOCUMENTS WERE STORED

AND IN ECBATANA THE CAPITAL THAT IS IN THE PROVINCE OF MEDIA A SCROLL WAS FOUND ON WHICH THIS WAS WRITTEN A RECORD

IN THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS THE KING CYRUS THE KING ISSUED A DECREE CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF GOD AT JERUSALEM LET THE HOUSE BE REBUILT THE PLACE WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED AND LET ITS FOUNDATIONS BE RETAINED

ITS HEIGHT SHALL BE SIXTY CUBITS AND ITS BREADTH SIXTY CUBITS WITH THREE LAYERS OF GREAT STONES AND ONE LAYER OF TIMBER

LET THE COST BE PAID FROM THE ROYAL TREASURY

AND ALSO LET THE GOLD AND SILVER VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD WHICH NEBUCHADNEZZAR TOOK OUT OF THE TEMPLE THAT IS IN JERUSALEM AND BROUGHT TO BABYLON BE RESTORED AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE TEMPLE THAT IS IN JERUSALEM EACH TO ITS PLACE

YOU SHALL PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

NOW THEREFORE TATTENAI GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER SHETHARBOZENAI AND YOUR ASSOCIATES THE GOVERNORS WHO ARE IN THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER KEEP AWAY

LET THE WORK ON THIS HOUSE OF GOD ALONE

LET THE GOVERNOR OF THE JEWS AND THE ELDERS OF THE JEWS REBUILD THIS HOUSE OF GOD ON ITS SITE

MOREOVER I MAKE A DECREE REGARDING WHAT YOU SHALL DO FOR THESE ELDERS OF THE JEWS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD

THE COST IS TO BE PAID TO THESE MEN IN FULL AND WITHOUT DELAY FROM THE ROYAL REVENUE THE TRIBUTE OF THE PROVINCE FROM BEYOND THE RIVER

AND WHATEVER IS NEEDEDBULLS RAMS OR SHEEP FOR BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN WHEAT SALT WINE OR OIL AS THE PRIESTS AT JERUSALEM REQUIRELET THAT BE GIVEN TO THEM DAY BY DAY WITHOUT FAIL THAT THEY MAY OFFER PLEASING SACRIFICES TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN AND PRAY FOR THE LIFE OF THE KING AND HIS SONS

ALSO I MAKE A DECREE THAT IF ANYONE ALTERS THIS EDICT A BEAM SHALL BE PULLED OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND HE SHALL BE IMPALED ON IT AND HIS HOUSE SHALL BE MADE A DUNGHILL

MAY THE GOD WHO HAS CAUSED HIS NAME TO DWELL THERE OVERTHROW ANY KING OR PEOPLE WHO SHALL PUT OUT A HAND TO ALTER THIS OR TO DESTROY THIS HOUSE OF GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM

I DARIUS MAKE A DECREE; LET IT BE DONE WITH ALL DILIGENCE

 THEN ACCORDING TO THE WORD SENT BY DARIUS THE KING TATTENAI THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER SHETHARBOZENAI AND THEIR ASSOCIATES DID WITH ALL DILIGENCE WHAT DARIUS THE KING HAD ORDERED

AND THE ELDERS OF THE JEWS BUILT AND PROSPERED THROUGH THE PROPHESYING OF HAGGAI THE PROPHET AND ZECHARIAH THE SON OF IDDO

THEY FINISHED THEIR BUILDING BY DECREE OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL AND BY DECREE OF CYRUS AND DARIUS AND ARTAXERXES KING OF PERSIA; AND THIS HOUSE WAS FINISHED ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE MONTH OF ADAR IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF DARIUS THE KING

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND THE REST OF THE RETURNED EXILES CELEBRATED THE DEDICATION OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD WITH JOY

THEY OFFERED AT THE DEDICATION OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD  BULLS  RAMS  LAMBS AND AS A SIN OFFERING FOR ALL ISRAEL  MALE GOATS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

AND THEY SET THE PRIESTS IN THEIR DIVISIONS AND THE LEVITES IN THEIR DIVISIONS FOR THE SERVICE OF GOD AT JERUSALEM AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF MOSES

ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH THE RETURNED EXILES KEPT THE PASSOVER

FOR THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES HAD PURIFIED THEMSELVES TOGETHER; ALL OF THEM WERE CLEAN

SO THEY SLAUGHTERED THE PASSOVER LAMB FOR ALL THE RETURNED EXILES FOR THEIR FELLOW PRIESTS AND FOR THEMSELVES

IT WAS EATEN BY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO HAD RETURNED FROM EXILE AND ALSO BY EVERYONE WHO HAD JOINED THEM AND SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE UNCLEANNESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE LAND TO WORSHIP THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

AND THEY KEPT THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD SEVEN DAYS WITH JOY FOR THE LORD HAD MADE THEM JOYFUL AND HAD TURNED THE HEART OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA TO THEM SO THAT HE AIDED THEM IN THE WORK OF THE HOUSE OF GOD THE GOD OF ISRAEL

NOW AFTER THIS IN THE REIGN OF ARTAXERXES KING OF PERSIA EZRA THE SON OF SERAIAH SON OF AZARIAH SON OF HILKIAH SON OF SHALLUM SON OF ZADOK SON OF AHITUB SON OF AMARIAH SON OF AZARIAH SON OF MERAIOTH SON OF ZERAHIAH SON OF UZZI SON OF BUKKI SON OF ABISHUA SON OF PHINEHAS SON OF ELEAZAR SON OF AARON THE CHIEF PRIEST THIS EZRA WENT UP FROM BABYLONIA

HE WAS A SCRIBE SKILLED IN THE LAW OF MOSES THAT THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAD GIVEN AND THE KING GRANTED HIM ALL THAT HE ASKED FOR THE HAND OF THE LORD HIS GOD WAS ON HIM

AND THERE WENT UP ALSO TO JERUSALEM IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF ARTAXERXES THE KING SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND SOME OF THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES THE SINGERS AND GATEKEEPERS AND THE TEMPLE SERVANTS

AND HE CAME TO JERUSALEM IN THE FIFTH MONTH WHICH WAS IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF THE KING

FOR ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH HE BEGAN TO GO UP FROM BABYLONIA AND ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH HE CAME TO JERUSALEM FOR THE GOOD HAND OF HIS GOD WAS ON HIM

FOR EZRA HAD SET HIS HEART TO STUDY THE LAW OF THE LORD AND TO DO IT AND TO TEACH HIS STATUTES AND RULES IN ISRAEL

THIS IS A COPY OF THE LETTER THAT KING ARTAXERXES GAVE TO EZRA THE PRIEST THE SCRIBE A MAN LEARNED IN MATTERS OF THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD AND HIS STATUTES FOR ISRAEL ARTAXERXES KING OF KINGS TO EZRA THE PRIEST THE SCRIBE OF THE LAW OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN

PEACE

AND NOW I MAKE A DECREE THAT ANYONE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OR THEIR PRIESTS OR LEVITES IN MY KINGDOM WHO FREELY OFFERS TO GO TO JERUSALEM MAY GO WITH YOU

FOR YOU ARE SENT BY THE KING AND HIS SEVEN COUNSELORS TO MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT JUDAH AND JERUSALEM ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF YOUR GOD WHICH IS IN YOUR HAND AND ALSO TO CARRY THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT THE KING AND HIS COUNSELORS HAVE FREELY OFFERED TO THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHOSE DWELLING IS IN JERUSALEM WITH ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT YOU SHALL FIND IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE OF BABYLONIA AND WITH THE FREEWILL OFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE PRIESTS VOWED WILLINGLY FOR THE HOUSE OF THEIR GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM

WITH THIS MONEY THEN YOU SHALL WITH ALL DILIGENCE BUY BULLS RAMS AND LAMBS WITH THEIR GRAIN OFFERINGS AND THEIR DRINK OFFERINGS AND YOU SHALL OFFER THEM ON THE ALTAR OF THE HOUSE OF YOUR GOD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM

WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD TO YOU AND YOUR BROTHERS TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE SILVER AND GOLD YOU MAY DO ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF YOUR GOD

THE VESSELS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN YOU FOR THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF YOUR GOD YOU SHALL DELIVER BEFORE THE GOD OF JERUSALEM

AND WHATEVER ELSE IS REQUIRED FOR THE HOUSE OF YOUR GOD WHICH IT FALLS TO YOU TO PROVIDE YOU MAY PROVIDE IT OUT OF THE KING'S TREASURY

AND I ARTAXERXES THE KING MAKE A DECREE TO ALL THE TREASURERS IN THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER WHATEVER EZRA THE PRIEST THE SCRIBE OF THE LAW OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN REQUIRES OF YOU LET IT BE DONE WITH ALL DILIGENCE UP TO  TALENTS OF SILVER  CORS OF WHEAT  BATHS OF WINE  BATHS OF OIL AND SALT WITHOUT PRESCRIBING HOW MUCH

WHATEVER IS DECREED BY THE GOD OF HEAVEN LET IT BE DONE IN FULL FOR THE HOUSE OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN LEST HIS WRATH BE AGAINST THE REALM OF THE KING AND HIS SONS

WE ALSO NOTIFY YOU THAT IT SHALL NOT BE LAWFUL TO IMPOSE TRIBUTE CUSTOM OR TOLL ON ANYONE OF THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES THE SINGERS THE DOORKEEPERS THE TEMPLE SERVANTS OR OTHER SERVANTS OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD

AND YOU EZRA ACCORDING TO THE WISDOM OF YOUR GOD THAT IS IN YOUR HAND APPOINT MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES WHO MAY JUDGE ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER ALL SUCH AS KNOW THE LAWS OF YOUR GOD

AND THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THEM YOU SHALL TEACH

WHOEVER WILL NOT OBEY THE LAW OF YOUR GOD AND THE LAW OF THE KING LET JUDGMENT BE STRICTLY EXECUTED ON HIM WHETHER FOR DEATH OR FOR BANISHMENT OR FOR CONFISCATION OF HIS GOODS OR FOR IMPRISONMENT

 BLESSED BE THE LORD THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS WHO PUT SUCH A THING AS THIS INTO THE HEART OF THE KING TO BEAUTIFY THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THAT IS IN JERUSALEM AND WHO EXTENDED TO ME HIS STEADFAST LOVE BEFORE THE KING AND HIS COUNSELORS AND BEFORE ALL THE KING'S MIGHTY OFFICERS

I TOOK COURAGE FOR THE HAND OF THE LORD MY GOD WAS ON ME AND I GATHERED LEADING MEN FROM ISRAEL TO GO UP WITH ME

THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES AND THIS IS THE GENEALOGY OF THOSE WHO WENT UP WITH ME FROM BABYLONIA IN THE REIGN OF ARTAXERXES THE KING OF THE SONS OF PHINEHAS GERSHOM

OF THE SONS OF ITHAMAR DANIEL

OF THE SONS OF DAVID HATTUSH

OF THE SONS OF SHECANIAH WHO WAS OF THE SONS OF PAROSH ZECHARIAH WITH WHOM WERE REGISTERED  MEN

OF THE SONS OF PAHATHMOAB ELIEHOENAI THE SON OF ZERAHIAH AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF ZATTU SHECANIAH THE SON OF JAHAZIEL AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF ADIN EBED THE SON OF JONATHAN AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF ELAM JESHAIAH THE SON OF ATHALIAH AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF SHEPHATIAH ZEBADIAH THE SON OF MICHAEL AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF JOAB OBADIAH THE SON OF JEHIEL AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF BANI SHELOMITH THE SON OF JOSIPHIAH AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF BEBAI ZECHARIAH THE SON OF BEBAI AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF AZGAD JOHANAN THE SON OF HAKKATAN AND WITH HIM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF ADONIKAM THOSE WHO CAME LATER THEIR NAMES BEING ELIPHELET JEUEL AND SHEMAIAH AND WITH THEM  MEN

OF THE SONS OF BIGVAI UTHAI AND ZACCUR AND WITH THEM  MEN

I GATHERED THEM TO THE RIVER THAT RUNS TO AHAVA AND THERE WE CAMPED THREE DAYS

AS I REVIEWED THE PEOPLE AND THE PRIESTS I FOUND THERE NONE OF THE SONS OF LEVI

THEN I SENT FOR ELIEZER ARIEL SHEMAIAH ELNATHAN JARIB ELNATHAN NATHAN ZECHARIAH AND MESHULLAM LEADING MEN AND FOR JOIARIB AND ELNATHAN WHO WERE MEN OF INSIGHT AND SENT THEM TO IDDO THE LEADING MAN AT THE PLACE CASIPHIA TELLING THEM WHAT TO SAY TO IDDO AND HIS BROTHERS AND THE TEMPLE SERVANTS AT THE PLACE CASIPHIA NAMELY TO SEND US MINISTERS FOR THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD

AND BY THE GOOD HAND OF OUR GOD ON US THEY BROUGHT US A MAN OF DISCRETION OF THE SONS OF MAHLI THE SON OF LEVI SON OF ISRAEL NAMELY SHEREBIAH WITH HIS SONS AND KINSMEN ; ALSO HASHABIAH AND WITH HIM JESHAIAH OF THE SONS OF MERARI WITH HIS KINSMEN AND THEIR SONS ; BESIDES  OF THE TEMPLE SERVANTS WHOM DAVID AND HIS OFFICIALS HAD SET APART TO ATTEND THE LEVITES

THESE WERE ALL MENTIONED BY NAME

THEN I PROCLAIMED A FAST THERE AT THE RIVER AHAVA THAT WE MIGHT HUMBLE OURSELVES BEFORE OUR GOD TO SEEK FROM HIM A SAFE JOURNEY FOR OURSELVES OUR CHILDREN AND ALL OUR GOODS

FOR I WAS ASHAMED TO ASK THE KING FOR A BAND OF SOLDIERS AND HORSEMEN TO PROTECT US AGAINST THE ENEMY ON OUR WAY SINCE WE HAD TOLD THE KING THE HAND OF OUR GOD IS FOR GOOD ON ALL WHO SEEK HIM AND THE POWER OF HIS WRATH IS AGAINST ALL WHO FORSAKE HIM

 SO WE FASTED AND IMPLORED OUR GOD FOR THIS AND HE LISTENED TO OUR ENTREATY

THEN I SET APART TWELVE OF THE LEADING PRIESTS SHEREBIAH HASHABIAH AND TEN OF THEIR KINSMEN WITH THEM

AND I WEIGHED OUT TO THEM THE SILVER AND THE GOLD AND THE VESSELS THE OFFERING FOR THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD THAT THE KING AND HIS COUNSELORS AND HIS LORDS AND ALL ISRAEL THERE PRESENT HAD OFFERED

I WEIGHED OUT INTO THEIR HAND  TALENTS OF SILVER AND SILVER VESSELS WORTH  TALENTS AND  TALENTS OF GOLD  BOWLS OF GOLD WORTH  DARICS AND TWO VESSELS OF FINE BRIGHT BRONZE AS PRECIOUS AS GOLD

AND I SAID TO THEM YOU ARE HOLY TO THE LORD AND THE VESSELS ARE HOLY AND THE SILVER AND THE GOLD ARE A FREEWILL OFFERING TO THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS

GUARD THEM AND KEEP THEM UNTIL YOU WEIGH THEM BEFORE THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES AND THE HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES IN ISRAEL AT JERUSALEM WITHIN THE CHAMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 SO THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES TOOK OVER THE WEIGHT OF THE SILVER AND THE GOLD AND THE VESSELS TO BRING THEM TO JERUSALEM TO THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD

THEN WE DEPARTED FROM THE RIVER AHAVA ON THE TWELFTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH TO GO TO JERUSALEM

THE HAND OF OUR GOD WAS ON US AND HE DELIVERED US FROM THE HAND OF THE ENEMY AND FROM AMBUSHES BY THE WAY

WE CAME TO JERUSALEM AND THERE WE REMAINED THREE DAYS

ON THE FOURTH DAY WITHIN THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD THE SILVER AND THE GOLD AND THE VESSELS WERE WEIGHED INTO THE HANDS OF MEREMOTH THE PRIEST SON OF URIAH AND WITH HIM WAS ELEAZAR THE SON OF PHINEHAS AND WITH THEM WERE THE LEVITES JOZABAD THE SON OF JESHUA AND NOADIAH THE SON OF BINNUI

THE WHOLE WAS COUNTED AND WEIGHED AND THE WEIGHT OF EVERYTHING WAS RECORDED

AT THAT TIME THOSE WHO HAD COME FROM CAPTIVITY THE RETURNED EXILES OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS TO THE GOD OF ISRAEL TWELVE BULLS FOR ALL ISRAEL NINETYSIX RAMS SEVENTYSEVEN LAMBS AND AS A SIN OFFERING TWELVE MALE GOATS

ALL THIS WAS A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD

THEY ALSO DELIVERED THE KING'S COMMISSIONS TO THE KING'S SATRAPS AND TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCE BEYOND THE RIVER AND THEY AIDED THE PEOPLE AND THE HOUSE OF GOD

AFTER THESE THINGS HAD BEEN DONE THE OFFICIALS APPROACHED ME AND SAID THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES HAVE NOT SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE LANDS WITH THEIR ABOMINATIONS FROM THE CANAANITES THE HITTITES THE PERIZZITES THE JEBUSITES THE AMMONITES THE MOABITES THE EGYPTIANS AND THE AMORITES

FOR THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THEIR DAUGHTERS TO BE WIVES FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR SONS SO THAT THE HOLY RACE HAS MIXED ITSELF WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE LANDS

AND IN THIS FAITHLESSNESS THE HAND OF THE OFFICIALS AND CHIEF MEN HAS BEEN FOREMOST

 AS SOON AS I HEARD THIS I TORE MY GARMENT AND MY CLOAK AND PULLED HAIR FROM MY HEAD AND BEARD AND SAT APPALLED

THEN ALL WHO TREMBLED AT THE WORDS OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL BECAUSE OF THE FAITHLESSNESS OF THE RETURNED EXILES GATHERED AROUND ME WHILE I SAT APPALLED UNTIL THE EVENING SACRIFICE

AND AT THE EVENING SACRIFICE I ROSE FROM MY FASTING WITH MY GARMENT AND MY CLOAK TORN AND FELL UPON MY KNEES AND SPREAD OUT MY HANDS TO THE LORD MY GOD SAYINGO MY GOD I AM ASHAMED AND BLUSH TO LIFT MY FACE TO YOU MY GOD FOR OUR INIQUITIES HAVE RISEN HIGHER THAN OUR HEADS AND OUR GUILT HAS MOUNTED UP TO THE HEAVENS

FROM THE DAYS OF OUR FATHERS TO THIS DAY WE HAVE BEEN IN GREAT GUILT

AND FOR OUR INIQUITIES WE OUR KINGS AND OUR PRIESTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KINGS OF THE LANDS TO THE SWORD TO CAPTIVITY TO PLUNDERING AND TO UTTER SHAME AS IT IS TODAY

BUT NOW FOR A BRIEF MOMENT FAVOR HAS BEEN SHOWN BY THE LORD OUR GOD TO LEAVE US A REMNANT AND TO GIVE US A SECURE HOLD WITHIN HIS HOLY PLACE THAT OUR GOD MAY BRIGHTEN OUR EYES AND GRANT US A LITTLE REVIVING IN OUR SLAVERY

FOR WE ARE SLAVES

YET OUR GOD HAS NOT FORSAKEN US IN OUR SLAVERY BUT HAS EXTENDED TO US HIS STEADFAST LOVE BEFORE THE KINGS OF PERSIA TO GRANT US SOME REVIVING TO SET UP THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD TO REPAIR ITS RUINS AND TO GIVE US PROTECTION IN JUDEA AND JERUSALEM

AND NOW O OUR GOD WHAT SHALL WE SAY AFTER THIS

FOR WE HAVE FORSAKEN YOUR COMMANDMENTS WHICH YOU COMMANDED BY YOUR SERVANTS THE PROPHETS SAYING 'THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ENTERING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT IS A LAND IMPURE WITH THE IMPURITY OF THE PEOPLES OF THE LANDS WITH THEIR ABOMINATIONS THAT HAVE FILLED IT FROM END TO END WITH THEIR UNCLEANNESS

THEREFORE DO NOT GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THEIR SONS NEITHER TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS FOR YOUR SONS AND NEVER SEEK THEIR PEACE OR PROSPERITY THAT YOU MAY BE STRONG AND EAT THE GOOD OF THE LAND AND LEAVE IT FOR AN INHERITANCE TO YOUR CHILDREN FOREVER

' AND AFTER ALL THAT HAS COME UPON US FOR OUR EVIL DEEDS AND FOR OUR GREAT GUILT SEEING THAT YOU OUR GOD HAVE PUNISHED US LESS THAN OUR INIQUITIES DESERVED AND HAVE GIVEN US SUCH A REMNANT AS THIS SHALL WE BREAK YOUR COMMANDMENTS AGAIN AND INTERMARRY WITH THE PEOPLES WHO PRACTICE THESE ABOMINATIONS

WOULD YOU NOT BE ANGRY WITH US UNTIL YOU CONSUMED US SO THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO REMNANT NOR ANY TO ESCAPE

O LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOU ARE JUST FOR WE ARE LEFT A REMNANT THAT HAS ESCAPED AS IT IS TODAY

BEHOLD WE ARE BEFORE YOU IN OUR GUILT FOR NONE CAN STAND BEFORE YOU BECAUSE OF THIS

WHILE EZRA PRAYED AND MADE CONFESSION WEEPING AND CASTING HIMSELF DOWN BEFORE THE HOUSE OF GOD A VERY GREAT ASSEMBLY OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN GATHERED TO HIM OUT OF ISRAEL FOR THE PEOPLE WEPT BITTERLY

AND SHECANIAH THE SON OF JEHIEL OF THE SONS OF ELAM ADDRESSED EZRA WE HAVE BROKEN FAITH WITH OUR GOD AND HAVE MARRIED FOREIGN WOMEN FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE LAND BUT EVEN NOW THERE IS HOPE FOR ISRAEL IN SPITE OF THIS

THEREFORE LET US MAKE A COVENANT WITH OUR GOD TO PUT AWAY ALL THESE WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE COUNSEL OF MY LORD AND OF THOSE WHO TREMBLE AT THE COMMANDMENT OF OUR GOD AND LET IT BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE LAW

ARISE FOR IT IS YOUR TASK AND WE ARE WITH YOU; BE STRONG AND DO IT

 THEN EZRA AROSE AND MADE THE LEADING PRIESTS AND LEVITES AND ALL ISRAEL TAKE OATH THAT THEY WOULD DO AS HAD BEEN SAID

SO THEY TOOK THE OATH

THEN EZRA WITHDREW FROM BEFORE THE HOUSE OF GOD AND WENT TO THE CHAMBER OF JEHOHANAN THE SON OF ELIASHIB WHERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT NEITHER EATING BREAD NOR DRINKING WATER FOR HE WAS MOURNING OVER THE FAITHLESSNESS OF THE EXILES

AND A PROCLAMATION WAS MADE THROUGHOUT JUDAH AND JERUSALEM TO ALL THE RETURNED EXILES THAT THEY SHOULD ASSEMBLE AT JERUSALEM AND THAT IF ANYONE DID NOT COME WITHIN THREE DAYS BY ORDER OF THE OFFICIALS AND THE ELDERS ALL HIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE FORFEITED AND HE HIMSELF BANNED FROM THE CONGREGATION OF THE EXILES

THEN ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH AND BENJAMIN ASSEMBLED AT JERUSALEM WITHIN THE THREE DAYS

IT WAS THE NINTH MONTH ON THE TWENTIETH DAY OF THE MONTH

AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAT IN THE OPEN SQUARE BEFORE THE HOUSE OF GOD TREMBLING BECAUSE OF THIS MATTER AND BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY RAIN

AND EZRA THE PRIEST STOOD UP AND SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE BROKEN FAITH AND MARRIED FOREIGN WOMEN AND SO INCREASED THE GUILT OF ISRAEL

NOW THEN MAKE CONFESSION TO THE LORD THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS AND DO HIS WILL

SEPARATE YOURSELVES FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE LAND AND FROM THE FOREIGN WIVES

 THEN ALL THE ASSEMBLY ANSWERED WITH A LOUD VOICE IT IS SO; WE MUST DO AS YOU HAVE SAID

BUT THE PEOPLE ARE MANY AND IT IS A TIME OF HEAVY RAIN; WE CANNOT STAND IN THE OPEN

NOR IS THIS A TASK FOR ONE DAY OR FOR TWO FOR WE HAVE GREATLY TRANSGRESSED IN THIS MATTER

LET OUR OFFICIALS STAND FOR THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY

LET ALL IN OUR CITIES WHO HAVE TAKEN FOREIGN WIVES COME AT APPOINTED TIMES AND WITH THEM THE ELDERS AND JUDGES OF EVERY CITY UNTIL THE FIERCE WRATH OF OUR GOD OVER THIS MATTER IS TURNED AWAY FROM US

 ONLY JONATHAN THE SON OF ASAHEL AND JAHZEIAH THE SON OF TIKVAH OPPOSED THIS AND MESHULLAM AND SHABBETHAI THE LEVITE SUPPORTED THEM

THEN THE RETURNED EXILES DID SO

EZRA THE PRIEST SELECTED MEN HEADS OF FATHERS' HOUSES ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES EACH OF THEM DESIGNATED BY NAME

ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE TENTH MONTH THEY SAT DOWN TO EXAMINE THE MATTER; AND BY THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH THEY HAD COME TO THE END OF ALL THE MEN WHO HAD MARRIED FOREIGN WOMEN

NOW THERE WERE FOUND SOME OF THE SONS OF THE PRIESTS WHO HAD MARRIED FOREIGN WOMEN MAASEIAH ELIEZER JARIB AND GEDALIAH SOME OF THE SONS OF JESHUA THE SON OF JOZADAK AND HIS BROTHERS

THEY PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PUT AWAY THEIR WIVES AND THEIR GUILT OFFERING WAS A RAM OF THE FLOCK FOR THEIR GUILT

OF THE SONS OF IMMER HANANI AND ZEBADIAH

OF THE SONS OF HARIM MAASEIAH ELIJAH SHEMAIAH JEHIEL AND UZZIAH

OF THE SONS OF PASHHUR ELIOENAI MAASEIAH ISHMAEL NETHANEL JOZABAD AND ELASAH

OF THE LEVITES JOZABAD SHIMEI KELAIAH THAT IS KELITA PETHAHIAH JUDAH AND ELIEZER

OF THE SINGERS ELIASHIB

OF THE GATEKEEPERS SHALLUM TELEM AND URI

AND OF ISRAEL OF THE SONS OF PAROSH RAMIAH IZZIAH MALCHIJAH MIJAMIN ELEAZAR HASHABIAH AND BENAIAH

OF THE SONS OF ELAM MATTANIAH ZECHARIAH JEHIEL ABDI JEREMOTH AND ELIJAH

OF THE SONS OF ZATTU ELIOENAI ELIASHIB MATTANIAH JEREMOTH ZABAD AND AZIZA

OF THE SONS OF BEBAI WERE JEHOHANAN HANANIAH ZABBAI AND ATHLAI

OF THE SONS OF BANI WERE MESHULLAM MALLUCH ADAIAH JASHUB SHEAL AND JEREMOTH

OF THE SONS OF PAHATHMOAB ADNA CHELAL BENAIAH MAASEIAH MATTANIAH BEZALEL BINNUI AND MANASSEH

OF THE SONS OF HARIM ELIEZER ISSHIJAH MALCHIJAH SHEMAIAH SHIMEON BENJAMIN MALLUCH AND SHEMARIAH

OF THE SONS OF HASHUM MATTENAI MATTATTAH ZABAD ELIPHELET JEREMAI MANASSEH AND SHIMEI

OF THE SONS OF BANI MAADAI AMRAM UEL BENAIAH BEDEIAH CHELUHI VANIAH MEREMOTH ELIASHIB MATTANIAH MATTENAI JAASU

OF THE SONS OF BINNUI SHIMEI SHELEMIAH NATHAN ADAIAH MACHNADEBAI SHASHAI SHARAI AZAREL SHELEMIAH SHEMARIAH SHALLUM AMARIAH AND JOSEPH

OF THE SONS OF NEBO JEIEL MATTITHIAH ZABAD ZEBINA JADDAI JOEL AND BENAIAH

ALL THESE HAD MARRIED FOREIGN WOMEN AND SOME OF THE WOMEN HAD EVEN BORNE CHILDREN

ROMANSPAUL A SERVANT OF CHRIST JESUS CALLED TO BE AN APOSTLE SET APART FOR THE GOSPEL OF GOD WHICH HE PROMISED BEFOREHAND THROUGH HIS PROPHETS IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES CONCERNING HIS SON WHO WAS DESCENDED FROM DAVID ACCORDING TO THE FLESH AND WAS DECLARED TO BE THE SON OF GOD IN POWER ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS BY HIS RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD THROUGH WHOM WE HAVE RECEIVED GRACE AND APOSTLESHIP TO BRING ABOUT THE OBEDIENCE OF FAITH FOR THE SAKE OF HIS NAME AMONG ALL THE NATIONS INCLUDING YOU WHO ARE CALLED TO BELONG TO JESUS CHRIST TO ALL THOSE IN ROME WHO ARE LOVED BY GOD AND CALLED TO BE SAINTSGRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

FIRST I THANK MY GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST FOR ALL OF YOU BECAUSE YOUR FAITH IS PROCLAIMED IN ALL THE WORLD

FOR GOD IS MY WITNESS WHOM I SERVE WITH MY SPIRIT IN THE GOSPEL OF HIS SON THAT WITHOUT CEASING I MENTION YOU ALWAYS IN MY PRAYERS ASKING THAT SOMEHOW BY GOD'S WILL I MAY NOW AT LAST SUCCEED IN COMING TO YOU

FOR I LONG TO SEE YOU THAT I MAY IMPART TO YOU SOME SPIRITUAL GIFT TO STRENGTHEN YOU THAT IS THAT WE MAY BE MUTUALLY ENCOURAGED BY EACH OTHER'S FAITH BOTH YOURS AND MINE

I WANT YOU TO KNOW BROTHERS THAT I HAVE OFTEN INTENDED TO COME TO YOU BUT THUS FAR HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IN ORDER THAT I MAY REAP SOME HARVEST AMONG YOU AS WELL AS AMONG THE REST OF THE GENTILES

I AM UNDER OBLIGATION BOTH TO GREEKS AND TO BARBARIANS BOTH TO THE WISE AND TO THE FOOLISH

SO I AM EAGER TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO YOU ALSO WHO ARE IN ROME

FOR I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL FOR IT IS THE POWER OF GOD FOR SALVATION TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES TO THE JEW FIRST AND ALSO TO THE GREEK

FOR IN IT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IS REVEALED FROM FAITH FOR FAITH AS IT IS WRITTEN THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE BY FAITH

 FOR THE WRATH OF GOD IS REVEALED FROM HEAVEN AGAINST ALL UNGODLINESS AND UNRIGHTEOUSNESS OF MEN WHO BY THEIR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SUPPRESS THE TRUTH

FOR WHAT CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT GOD IS PLAIN TO THEM BECAUSE GOD HAS SHOWN IT TO THEM

FOR HIS INVISIBLE ATTRIBUTES NAMELY HIS ETERNAL POWER AND DIVINE NATURE HAVE BEEN CLEARLY PERCEIVED EVER SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD IN THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

SO THEY ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE

FOR ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW GOD THEY DID NOT HONOR HIM AS GOD OR GIVE THANKS TO HIM BUT THEY BECAME FUTILE IN THEIR THINKING AND THEIR FOOLISH HEARTS WERE DARKENED

CLAIMING TO BE WISE THEY BECAME FOOLS AND EXCHANGED THE GLORY OF THE IMMORTAL GOD FOR IMAGES RESEMBLING MORTAL MAN AND BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND REPTILES

THEREFORE GOD GAVE THEM UP IN THE LUSTS OF THEIR HEARTS TO IMPURITY TO THE DISHONORING OF THEIR BODIES AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY EXCHANGED THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD FOR A LIE AND WORSHIPED AND SERVED THE CREATURE RATHER THAN THE CREATOR WHO IS BLESSED FOREVER

AMEN

FOR THIS REASON GOD GAVE THEM UP TO DISHONORABLE PASSIONS

FOR THEIR WOMEN EXCHANGED NATURAL RELATIONS FOR THOSE THAT ARE CONTRARY TO NATURE; AND THE MEN LIKEWISE GAVE UP NATURAL RELATIONS WITH WOMEN AND WERE CONSUMED WITH PASSION FOR ONE ANOTHER MEN COMMITTING SHAMELESS ACTS WITH MEN AND RECEIVING IN THEMSELVES THE DUE PENALTY FOR THEIR ERROR

AND SINCE THEY DID NOT SEE FIT TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD GOD GAVE THEM UP TO A DEBASED MIND TO DO WHAT OUGHT NOT TO BE DONE

THEY WERE FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS EVIL COVETOUSNESS MALICE

THEY ARE FULL OF ENVY MURDER STRIFE DECEIT MALICIOUSNESS

THEY ARE GOSSIPS SLANDERERS HATERS OF GOD INSOLENT HAUGHTY BOASTFUL INVENTORS OF EVIL DISOBEDIENT TO PARENTS FOOLISH FAITHLESS HEARTLESS RUTHLESS

THOUGH THEY KNOW GOD'S DECREE THAT THOSE WHO PRACTICE SUCH THINGS DESERVE TO DIE THEY NOT ONLY DO THEM BUT GIVE APPROVAL TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE THEM

THEREFORE YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE O MAN EVERY ONE OF YOU WHO JUDGES

FOR IN PASSING JUDGMENT ON ANOTHER YOU CONDEMN YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU THE JUDGE PRACTICE THE VERY SAME THINGS

WE KNOW THAT THE JUDGMENT OF GOD RIGHTLY FALLS ON THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS

DO YOU SUPPOSE O MANYOU WHO JUDGE THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS AND YET DO THEM YOURSELFTHAT YOU WILL ESCAPE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD

OR DO YOU PRESUME ON THE RICHES OF HIS KINDNESS AND FORBEARANCE AND PATIENCE NOT KNOWING THAT GOD'S KINDNESS IS MEANT TO LEAD YOU TO REPENTANCE

BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR HARD AND IMPENITENT HEART YOU ARE STORING UP WRATH FOR YOURSELF ON THE DAY OF WRATH WHEN GOD'S RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT WILL BE REVEALED

HE WILL RENDER TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS TO THOSE WHO BY PATIENCE IN WELLDOING SEEK FOR GLORY AND HONOR AND IMMORTALITY HE WILL GIVE ETERNAL LIFE; BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE SELFSEEKING AND DO NOT OBEY THE TRUTH BUT OBEY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS THERE WILL BE WRATH AND FURY

THERE WILL BE TRIBULATION AND DISTRESS FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING WHO DOES EVIL THE JEW FIRST AND ALSO THE GREEK BUT GLORY AND HONOR AND PEACE FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES GOOD THE JEW FIRST AND ALSO THE GREEK

FOR GOD SHOWS NO PARTIALITY

FOR ALL WHO HAVE SINNED WITHOUT THE LAW WILL ALSO PERISH WITHOUT THE LAW AND ALL WHO HAVE SINNED UNDER THE LAW WILL BE JUDGED BY THE LAW

FOR IT IS NOT THE HEARERS OF THE LAW WHO ARE RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD BUT THE DOERS OF THE LAW WHO WILL BE JUSTIFIED

FOR WHEN GENTILES WHO DO NOT HAVE THE LAW BY NATURE DO WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES THEY ARE A LAW TO THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LAW

THEY SHOW THAT THE WORK OF THE LAW IS WRITTEN ON THEIR HEARTS WHILE THEIR CONSCIENCE ALSO BEARS WITNESS AND THEIR CONFLICTING THOUGHTS ACCUSE OR EVEN EXCUSE THEM ON THAT DAY WHEN ACCORDING TO MY GOSPEL GOD JUDGES THE SECRETS OF MEN BY CHRIST JESUS

BUT IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A JEW AND RELY ON THE LAW AND BOAST IN GOD AND KNOW HIS WILL AND APPROVE WHAT IS EXCELLENT BECAUSE YOU ARE INSTRUCTED FROM THE LAW; AND IF YOU ARE SURE THAT YOU YOURSELF ARE A GUIDE TO THE BLIND A LIGHT TO THOSE WHO ARE IN DARKNESS AN INSTRUCTOR OF THE FOOLISH A TEACHER OF CHILDREN HAVING IN THE LAW THE EMBODIMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH YOU THEN WHO TEACH OTHERS DO YOU NOT TEACH YOURSELF

WHILE YOU PREACH AGAINST STEALING DO YOU STEAL

YOU WHO SAY THAT ONE MUST NOT COMMIT ADULTERY DO YOU COMMIT ADULTERY

YOU WHO ABHOR IDOLS DO YOU ROB TEMPLES

YOU WHO BOAST IN THE LAW DISHONOR GOD BY BREAKING THE LAW

FOR AS IT IS WRITTEN THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU

 FOR CIRCUMCISION INDEED IS OF VALUE IF YOU OBEY THE LAW BUT IF YOU BREAK THE LAW YOUR CIRCUMCISION BECOMES UNCIRCUMCISION

SO IF A MAN WHO IS UNCIRCUMCISED KEEPS THE PRECEPTS OF THE LAW WILL NOT HIS UNCIRCUMCISION BE REGARDED AS CIRCUMCISION

THEN HE WHO IS PHYSICALLY UNCIRCUMCISED BUT KEEPS THE LAW WILL CONDEMN YOU WHO HAVE THE WRITTEN CODE AND CIRCUMCISION BUT BREAK THE LAW

FOR NO ONE IS A JEW WHO IS MERELY ONE OUTWARDLY NOR IS CIRCUMCISION OUTWARD AND PHYSICAL

BUT A JEW IS ONE INWARDLY AND CIRCUMCISION IS A MATTER OF THE HEART BY THE SPIRIT NOT BY THE LETTER

HIS PRAISE IS NOT FROM MAN BUT FROM GOD

THEN WHAT ADVANTAGE HAS THE JEW

OR WHAT IS THE VALUE OF CIRCUMCISION

MUCH IN EVERY WAY

TO BEGIN WITH THE JEWS WERE ENTRUSTED WITH THE ORACLES OF GOD

WHAT IF SOME WERE UNFAITHFUL

DOES THEIR FAITHLESSNESS NULLIFY THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD

BY NO MEANS

LET GOD BE TRUE THOUGH EVERY ONE WERE A LIAR AS IT IS WRITTEN THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED

 BUT IF OUR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SERVES TO SHOW THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD WHAT SHALL WE SAY

THAT GOD IS UNRIGHTEOUS TO INFLICT WRATH ON US

I SPEAK IN A HUMAN WAY

 BY NO MEANS

FOR THEN HOW COULD GOD JUDGE THE WORLD

BUT IF THROUGH MY LIE GOD'S TRUTH ABOUNDS TO HIS GLORY WHY AM I STILL BEING CONDEMNED AS A SINNER

AND WHY NOT DO EVIL THAT GOOD MAY COME

AS SOME PEOPLE SLANDEROUSLY CHARGE US WITH SAYING

THEIR CONDEMNATION IS JUST

WHAT THEN

ARE WE JEWS ANY BETTER OFF

NO NOT AT ALL

FOR WE HAVE ALREADY CHARGED THAT ALL BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS ARE UNDER SIN AS IT IS WRITTEN NONE IS RIGHTEOUS NO NOT ONE; NO ONE UNDERSTANDS; NO ONE SEEKS FOR GOD

ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE; TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME WORTHLESS; NO ONE DOES GOOD NOT EVEN ONE

 THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE; THEY USE THEIR TONGUES TO DECEIVE

THE VENOM OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS

 THEIR MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSES AND BITTERNESS

 THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD; IN THEIR PATHS ARE RUIN AND MISERY AND THE WAY OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN

 THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES

 NOW WE KNOW THAT WHATEVER THE LAW SAYS IT SPEAKS TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THE LAW SO THAT EVERY MOUTH MAY BE STOPPED AND THE WHOLE WORLD MAY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD

FOR BY WORKS OF THE LAW NO HUMAN BEING WILL BE JUSTIFIED IN HIS SIGHT SINCE THROUGH THE LAW COMES KNOWLEDGE OF SIN

BUT NOW THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD HAS BEEN MANIFESTED APART FROM THE LAW ALTHOUGH THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS BEAR WITNESS TO IT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST FOR ALL WHO BELIEVE

FOR THERE IS NO DISTINCTION FOR ALL HAVE SINNED AND FALL SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD AND ARE JUSTIFIED BY HIS GRACE AS A GIFT THROUGH THE REDEMPTION THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS WHOM GOD PUT FORWARD AS A PROPITIATION BY HIS BLOOD TO BE RECEIVED BY FAITH

THIS WAS TO SHOW GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE IN HIS DIVINE FORBEARANCE HE HAD PASSED OVER FORMER SINS

IT WAS TO SHOW HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AT THE PRESENT TIME SO THAT HE MIGHT BE JUST AND THE JUSTIFIER OF THE ONE WHO HAS FAITH IN JESUS

THEN WHAT BECOMES OF OUR BOASTING

IT IS EXCLUDED

BY WHAT KIND OF LAW

BY A LAW OF WORKS

NO BUT BY THE LAW OF FAITH

FOR WE HOLD THAT ONE IS JUSTIFIED BY FAITH APART FROM WORKS OF THE LAW

OR IS GOD THE GOD OF JEWS ONLY

IS HE NOT THE GOD OF GENTILES ALSO

YES OF GENTILES ALSO SINCE GOD IS ONE

HE WILL JUSTIFY THE CIRCUMCISED BY FAITH AND THE UNCIRCUMCISED THROUGH FAITH

DO WE THEN OVERTHROW THE LAW BY THIS FAITH

BY NO MEANS

ON THE CONTRARY WE UPHOLD THE LAW

WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY WAS GAINED BY ABRAHAM OUR FOREFATHER ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

FOR IF ABRAHAM WAS JUSTIFIED BY WORKS HE HAS SOMETHING TO BOAST ABOUT BUT NOT BEFORE GOD

FOR WHAT DOES THE SCRIPTURE SAY

ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS

 NOW TO THE ONE WHO WORKS HIS WAGES ARE NOT COUNTED AS A GIFT BUT AS HIS DUE

AND TO THE ONE WHO DOES NOT WORK BUT TRUSTS HIM WHO JUSTIFIES THE UNGODLY HIS FAITH IS COUNTED AS RIGHTEOUSNESS JUST AS DAVID ALSO SPEAKS OF THE BLESSING OF THE ONE TO WHOM GOD COUNTS RIGHTEOUSNESS APART FROM WORKS BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS ARE FORGIVEN AND WHOSE SINS ARE COVERED; BLESSED IS THE MAN AGAINST WHOM THE LORD WILL NOT COUNT HIS SIN

 IS THIS BLESSING THEN ONLY FOR THE CIRCUMCISED OR ALSO FOR THE UNCIRCUMCISED

WE SAY THAT FAITH WAS COUNTED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS

HOW THEN WAS IT COUNTED TO HIM

WAS IT BEFORE OR AFTER HE HAD BEEN CIRCUMCISED

IT WAS NOT AFTER BUT BEFORE HE WAS CIRCUMCISED

HE RECEIVED THE SIGN OF CIRCUMCISION AS A SEAL OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT HE HAD BY FAITH WHILE HE WAS STILL UNCIRCUMCISED

THE PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE HIM THE FATHER OF ALL WHO BELIEVE WITHOUT BEING CIRCUMCISED SO THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WOULD BE COUNTED TO THEM AS WELL AND TO MAKE HIM THE FATHER OF THE CIRCUMCISED WHO ARE NOT MERELY CIRCUMCISED BUT WHO ALSO WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE FAITH THAT OUR FATHER ABRAHAM HAD BEFORE HE WAS CIRCUMCISED

FOR THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM AND HIS OFFSPRING THAT HE WOULD BE HEIR OF THE WORLD DID NOT COME THROUGH THE LAW BUT THROUGH THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH

FOR IF IT IS THE ADHERENTS OF THE LAW WHO ARE TO BE THE HEIRS FAITH IS NULL AND THE PROMISE IS VOID

FOR THE LAW BRINGS WRATH BUT WHERE THERE IS NO LAW THERE IS NO TRANSGRESSION

THAT IS WHY IT DEPENDS ON FAITH IN ORDER THAT THE PROMISE MAY REST ON GRACE AND BE GUARANTEED TO ALL HIS OFFSPRINGNOT ONLY TO THE ADHERENT OF THE LAW BUT ALSO TO THE ONE WHO SHARES THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM WHO IS THE FATHER OF US ALL AS IT IS WRITTEN I HAVE MADE YOU THE FATHER OF MANY NATIONSIN THE PRESENCE OF THE GOD IN WHOM HE BELIEVED WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD AND CALLS INTO EXISTENCE THE THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST

IN HOPE HE BELIEVED AGAINST HOPE THAT HE SHOULD BECOME THE FATHER OF MANY NATIONS AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD SO SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING BE

 HE DID NOT WEAKEN IN FAITH WHEN HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN BODY WHICH WAS AS GOOD AS DEAD SINCE HE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS OLD OR WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE BARRENNESS OF SARAH'S WOMB

NO DISTRUST MADE HIM WAVER CONCERNING THE PROMISE OF GOD BUT HE GREW STRONG IN HIS FAITH AS HE GAVE GLORY TO GOD FULLY CONVINCED THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO DO WHAT HE HAD PROMISED

THAT IS WHY HIS FAITH WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS

 BUT THE WORDS IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM WERE NOT WRITTEN FOR HIS SAKE ALONE BUT FOR OURS ALSO

IT WILL BE COUNTED TO US WHO BELIEVE IN HIM WHO RAISED FROM THE DEAD JESUS OUR LORD WHO WAS DELIVERED UP FOR OUR TRESPASSES AND RAISED FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION

THEREFORE SINCE WE HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED BY FAITH WE HAVE PEACE WITH GOD THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

THROUGH HIM WE HAVE ALSO OBTAINED ACCESS BY FAITH INTO THIS GRACE IN WHICH WE STAND AND WE REJOICE IN HOPE OF THE GLORY OF GOD

MORE THAN THAT WE REJOICE IN OUR SUFFERINGS KNOWING THAT SUFFERING PRODUCES ENDURANCE AND ENDURANCE PRODUCES CHARACTER AND CHARACTER PRODUCES HOPE AND HOPE DOES NOT PUT US TO SHAME BECAUSE GOD'S LOVE HAS BEEN POURED INTO OUR HEARTS THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US

FOR WHILE WE WERE STILL WEAK AT THE RIGHT TIME CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY

FOR ONE WILL SCARCELY DIE FOR A RIGHTEOUS PERSONTHOUGH PERHAPS FOR A GOOD PERSON ONE WOULD DARE EVEN TO DIE BUT GOD SHOWS HIS LOVE FOR US IN THAT WHILE WE WERE STILL SINNERS CHRIST DIED FOR US

SINCE THEREFORE WE HAVE NOW BEEN JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD MUCH MORE SHALL WE BE SAVED BY HIM FROM THE WRATH OF GOD

FOR IF WHILE WE WERE ENEMIES WE WERE RECONCILED TO GOD BY THE DEATH OF HIS SON MUCH MORE NOW THAT WE ARE RECONCILED SHALL WE BE SAVED BY HIS LIFE

MORE THAN THAT WE ALSO REJOICE IN GOD THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THROUGH WHOM WE HAVE NOW RECEIVED RECONCILIATION

THEREFORE JUST AS SIN CAME INTO THE WORLD THROUGH ONE MAN AND DEATH THROUGH SIN AND SO DEATH SPREAD TO ALL MEN BECAUSE ALL SINNED FOR SIN INDEED WAS IN THE WORLD BEFORE THE LAW WAS GIVEN BUT SIN IS NOT COUNTED WHERE THERE IS NO LAW

YET DEATH REIGNED FROM ADAM TO MOSES EVEN OVER THOSE WHOSE SINNING WAS NOT LIKE THE TRANSGRESSION OF ADAM WHO WAS A TYPE OF THE ONE WHO WAS TO COME

BUT THE FREE GIFT IS NOT LIKE THE TRESPASS

FOR IF MANY DIED THROUGH ONE MAN'S TRESPASS MUCH MORE HAVE THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE FREE GIFT BY THE GRACE OF THAT ONE MAN JESUS CHRIST ABOUNDED FOR MANY

AND THE FREE GIFT IS NOT LIKE THE RESULT OF THAT ONE MAN'S SIN

FOR THE JUDGMENT FOLLOWING ONE TRESPASS BROUGHT CONDEMNATION BUT THE FREE GIFT FOLLOWING MANY TRESPASSES BROUGHT JUSTIFICATION

IF BECAUSE OF ONE MAN'S TRESPASS DEATH REIGNED THROUGH THAT ONE MAN MUCH MORE WILL THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE ABUNDANCE OF GRACE AND THE FREE GIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS REIGN IN LIFE THROUGH THE ONE MAN JESUS CHRIST

THEREFORE AS ONE TRESPASS LED TO CONDEMNATION FOR ALL MEN SO ONE ACT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS LEADS TO JUSTIFICATION AND LIFE FOR ALL MEN

FOR AS BY THE ONE MAN'S DISOBEDIENCE THE MANY WERE MADE SINNERS SO BY THE ONE MAN'S OBEDIENCE THE MANY WILL BE MADE RIGHTEOUS

NOW THE LAW CAME IN TO INCREASE THE TRESPASS BUT WHERE SIN INCREASED GRACE ABOUNDED ALL THE MORE SO THAT AS SIN REIGNED IN DEATH GRACE ALSO MIGHT REIGN THROUGH RIGHTEOUSNESS LEADING TO ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD

WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN

ARE WE TO CONTINUE IN SIN THAT GRACE MAY ABOUND

BY NO MEANS

HOW CAN WE WHO DIED TO SIN STILL LIVE IN IT

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST JESUS WERE BAPTIZED INTO HIS DEATH

WE WERE BURIED THEREFORE WITH HIM BY BAPTISM INTO DEATH IN ORDER THAT JUST AS CHRIST WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD BY THE GLORY OF THE FATHER WE TOO MIGHT WALK IN NEWNESS OF LIFE

FOR IF WE HAVE BEEN UNITED WITH HIM IN A DEATH LIKE HIS WE SHALL CERTAINLY BE UNITED WITH HIM IN A RESURRECTION LIKE HIS

WE KNOW THAT OUR OLD SELF WAS CRUCIFIED WITH HIM IN ORDER THAT THE BODY OF SIN MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO NOTHING SO THAT WE WOULD NO LONGER BE ENSLAVED TO SIN

FOR ONE WHO HAS DIED HAS BEEN SET FREE FROM SIN

NOW IF WE HAVE DIED WITH CHRIST WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ALSO LIVE WITH HIM

WE KNOW THAT CHRIST BEING RAISED FROM THE DEAD WILL NEVER DIE AGAIN; DEATH NO LONGER HAS DOMINION OVER HIM

FOR THE DEATH HE DIED HE DIED TO SIN ONCE FOR ALL BUT THE LIFE HE LIVES HE LIVES TO GOD

SO YOU ALSO MUST CONSIDER YOURSELVES DEAD TO SIN AND ALIVE TO GOD IN CHRIST JESUS

LET NOT SIN THEREFORE REIGN IN YOUR MORTAL BODIES TO MAKE YOU OBEY THEIR PASSIONS

DO NOT PRESENT YOUR MEMBERS TO SIN AS INSTRUMENTS FOR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS BUT PRESENT YOURSELVES TO GOD AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FROM DEATH TO LIFE AND YOUR MEMBERS TO GOD AS INSTRUMENTS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS

FOR SIN WILL HAVE NO DOMINION OVER YOU SINCE YOU ARE NOT UNDER LAW BUT UNDER GRACE

WHAT THEN

ARE WE TO SIN BECAUSE WE ARE NOT UNDER LAW BUT UNDER GRACE

BY NO MEANS

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IF YOU PRESENT YOURSELVES TO ANYONE AS OBEDIENT SLAVES YOU ARE SLAVES OF THE ONE WHOM YOU OBEY EITHER OF SIN WHICH LEADS TO DEATH OR OF OBEDIENCE WHICH LEADS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS

BUT THANKS BE TO GOD THAT YOU WHO WERE ONCE SLAVES OF SIN HAVE BECOME OBEDIENT FROM THE HEART TO THE STANDARD OF TEACHING TO WHICH YOU WERE COMMITTED AND HAVING BEEN SET FREE FROM SIN HAVE BECOME SLAVES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

I AM SPEAKING IN HUMAN TERMS BECAUSE OF YOUR NATURAL LIMITATIONS

FOR JUST AS YOU ONCE PRESENTED YOUR MEMBERS AS SLAVES TO IMPURITY AND TO LAWLESSNESS LEADING TO MORE LAWLESSNESS SO NOW PRESENT YOUR MEMBERS AS SLAVES TO RIGHTEOUSNESS LEADING TO SANCTIFICATION

WHEN YOU WERE SLAVES OF SIN YOU WERE FREE IN REGARD TO RIGHTEOUSNESS

BUT WHAT FRUIT WERE YOU GETTING AT THAT TIME FROM THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU ARE NOW ASHAMED

THE END OF THOSE THINGS IS DEATH

BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SET FREE FROM SIN AND HAVE BECOME SLAVES OF GOD THE FRUIT YOU GET LEADS TO SANCTIFICATION AND ITS END ETERNAL LIFE

FOR THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH BUT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD

OR DO YOU NOT KNOW BROTHERSFOR I AM SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO KNOW THE LAWTHAT THE LAW IS BINDING ON A PERSON ONLY AS LONG AS HE LIVES

THUS A MARRIED WOMAN IS BOUND BY LAW TO HER HUSBAND WHILE HE LIVES BUT IF HER HUSBAND DIES SHE IS RELEASED FROM THE LAW OF MARRIAGE

ACCORDINGLY SHE WILL BE CALLED AN ADULTERESS IF SHE LIVES WITH ANOTHER MAN WHILE HER HUSBAND IS ALIVE

BUT IF HER HUSBAND DIES SHE IS FREE FROM THAT LAW AND IF SHE MARRIES ANOTHER MAN SHE IS NOT AN ADULTERESS

LIKEWISE MY BROTHERS YOU ALSO HAVE DIED TO THE LAW THROUGH THE BODY OF CHRIST SO THAT YOU MAY BELONG TO ANOTHER TO HIM WHO HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BEAR FRUIT FOR GOD

FOR WHILE WE WERE LIVING IN THE FLESH OUR SINFUL PASSIONS AROUSED BY THE LAW WERE AT WORK IN OUR MEMBERS TO BEAR FRUIT FOR DEATH

BUT NOW WE ARE RELEASED FROM THE LAW HAVING DIED TO THAT WHICH HELD US CAPTIVE SO THAT WE SERVE NOT UNDER THE OLD WRITTEN CODE BUT IN THE NEW LIFE OF THE SPIRIT

WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY

THAT THE LAW IS SIN

BY NO MEANS

YET IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LAW I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN SIN

I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO COVET IF THE LAW HAD NOT SAID YOU SHALL NOT COVET

 BUT SIN SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE COMMANDMENT PRODUCED IN ME ALL KINDS OF COVETOUSNESS

APART FROM THE LAW SIN LIES DEAD

I WAS ONCE ALIVE APART FROM THE LAW BUT WHEN THE COMMANDMENT CAME SIN CAME ALIVE AND I DIED

THE VERY COMMANDMENT THAT PROMISED LIFE PROVED TO BE DEATH TO ME

FOR SIN SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE COMMANDMENT DECEIVED ME AND THROUGH IT KILLED ME

SO THE LAW IS HOLY AND THE COMMANDMENT IS HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS AND GOOD

DID THAT WHICH IS GOOD THEN BRING DEATH TO ME

BY NO MEANS

IT WAS SIN PRODUCING DEATH IN ME THROUGH WHAT IS GOOD IN ORDER THAT SIN MIGHT BE SHOWN TO BE SIN AND THROUGH THE COMMANDMENT MIGHT BECOME SINFUL BEYOND MEASURE

FOR WE KNOW THAT THE LAW IS SPIRITUAL BUT I AM OF THE FLESH SOLD UNDER SIN

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY OWN ACTIONS

FOR I DO NOT DO WHAT I WANT BUT I DO THE VERY THING I HATE

NOW IF I DO WHAT I DO NOT WANT I AGREE WITH THE LAW THAT IT IS GOOD

SO NOW IT IS NO LONGER I WHO DO IT BUT SIN THAT DWELLS WITHIN ME

FOR I KNOW THAT NOTHING GOOD DWELLS IN ME THAT IS IN MY FLESH

FOR I HAVE THE DESIRE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT BUT NOT THE ABILITY TO CARRY IT OUT

FOR I DO NOT DO THE GOOD I WANT BUT THE EVIL I DO NOT WANT IS WHAT I KEEP ON DOING

NOW IF I DO WHAT I DO NOT WANT IT IS NO LONGER I WHO DO IT BUT SIN THAT DWELLS WITHIN ME

SO I FIND IT TO BE A LAW THAT WHEN I WANT TO DO RIGHT EVIL LIES CLOSE AT HAND

FOR I DELIGHT IN THE LAW OF GOD IN MY INNER BEING BUT I SEE IN MY MEMBERS ANOTHER LAW WAGING WAR AGAINST THE LAW OF MY MIND AND MAKING ME CAPTIVE TO THE LAW OF SIN THAT DWELLS IN MY MEMBERS

WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM

WHO WILL DELIVER ME FROM THIS BODY OF DEATH

THANKS BE TO GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD

SO THEN I MYSELF SERVE THE LAW OF GOD WITH MY MIND BUT WITH MY FLESH I SERVE THE LAW OF SIN

THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST JESUS

FOR THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE HAS SET YOU FREE IN CHRIST JESUS FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH

FOR GOD HAS DONE WHAT THE LAW WEAKENED BY THE FLESH COULD NOT DO

BY SENDING HIS OWN SON IN THE LIKENESS OF SINFUL FLESH AND FOR SIN HE CONDEMNED SIN IN THE FLESH IN ORDER THAT THE RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT OF THE LAW MIGHT BE FULFILLED IN US WHO WALK NOT ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT

FOR THOSE WHO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH SET THEIR MINDS ON THE THINGS OF THE FLESH BUT THOSE WHO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT SET THEIR MINDS ON THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT

TO SET THE MIND ON THE FLESH IS DEATH BUT TO SET THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT IS LIFE AND PEACE

FOR THE MIND THAT IS SET ON THE FLESH IS HOSTILE TO GOD FOR IT DOES NOT SUBMIT TO GOD'S LAW; INDEED IT CANNOT

THOSE WHO ARE IN THE FLESH CANNOT PLEASE GOD

YOU HOWEVER ARE NOT IN THE FLESH BUT IN THE SPIRIT IF IN FACT THE SPIRIT OF GOD DWELLS IN YOU

ANYONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM

BUT IF CHRIST IS IN YOU ALTHOUGH THE BODY IS DEAD BECAUSE OF SIN THE SPIRIT IS LIFE BECAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

IF THE SPIRIT OF HIM WHO RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD DWELLS IN YOU HE WHO RAISED CHRIST JESUS FROM THE DEAD WILL ALSO GIVE LIFE TO YOUR MORTAL BODIES THROUGH HIS SPIRIT WHO DWELLS IN YOU

SO THEN BROTHERS WE ARE DEBTORS NOT TO THE FLESH TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

FOR IF YOU LIVE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH YOU WILL DIE BUT IF BY THE SPIRIT YOU PUT TO DEATH THE DEEDS OF THE BODY YOU WILL LIVE

FOR ALL WHO ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD ARE SONS OF GOD

FOR YOU DID NOT RECEIVE THE SPIRIT OF SLAVERY TO FALL BACK INTO FEAR BUT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION AS SONS BY WHOM WE CRY ABBA

FATHER

 THE SPIRIT HIMSELF BEARS WITNESS WITH OUR SPIRIT THAT WE ARE CHILDREN OF GOD AND IF CHILDREN THEN HEIRSHEIRS OF GOD AND FELLOW HEIRS WITH CHRIST PROVIDED WE SUFFER WITH HIM IN ORDER THAT WE MAY ALSO BE GLORIFIED WITH HIM

FOR I CONSIDER THAT THE SUFFERINGS OF THIS PRESENT TIME ARE NOT WORTH COMPARING WITH THE GLORY THAT IS TO BE REVEALED TO US

FOR THE CREATION WAITS WITH EAGER LONGING FOR THE REVEALING OF THE SONS OF GOD

FOR THE CREATION WAS SUBJECTED TO FUTILITY NOT WILLINGLY BUT BECAUSE OF HIM WHO SUBJECTED IT IN HOPE THAT THE CREATION ITSELF WILL BE SET FREE FROM ITS BONDAGE TO DECAY AND OBTAIN THE FREEDOM OF THE GLORY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD

FOR WE KNOW THAT THE WHOLE CREATION HAS BEEN GROANING TOGETHER IN THE PAINS OF CHILDBIRTH UNTIL NOW

AND NOT ONLY THE CREATION BUT WE OURSELVES WHO HAVE THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THE SPIRIT GROAN INWARDLY AS WE WAIT EAGERLY FOR ADOPTION AS SONS THE REDEMPTION OF OUR BODIES

FOR IN THIS HOPE WE WERE SAVED

NOW HOPE THAT IS SEEN IS NOT HOPE

FOR WHO HOPES FOR WHAT HE SEES

BUT IF WE HOPE FOR WHAT WE DO NOT SEE WE WAIT FOR IT WITH PATIENCE

LIKEWISE THE SPIRIT HELPS US IN OUR WEAKNESS

FOR WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO PRAY FOR AS WE OUGHT BUT THE SPIRIT HIMSELF INTERCEDES FOR US WITH GROANINGS TOO DEEP FOR WORDS

AND HE WHO SEARCHES HEARTS KNOWS WHAT IS THE MIND OF THE SPIRIT BECAUSE THE SPIRIT INTERCEDES FOR THE SAINTS ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD

AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THOSE WHO LOVE GOD ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD FOR THOSE WHO ARE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE

FOR THOSE WHOM HE FOREKNEW HE ALSO PREDESTINED TO BE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF HIS SON IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BROTHERS

AND THOSE WHOM HE PREDESTINED HE ALSO CALLED AND THOSE WHOM HE CALLED HE ALSO JUSTIFIED AND THOSE WHOM HE JUSTIFIED HE ALSO GLORIFIED

WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY TO THESE THINGS

IF GOD IS FOR US WHO CAN BE AGAINST US

HE WHO DID NOT SPARE HIS OWN SON BUT GAVE HIM UP FOR US ALL HOW WILL HE NOT ALSO WITH HIM GRACIOUSLY GIVE US ALL THINGS

WHO SHALL BRING ANY CHARGE AGAINST GOD'S ELECT

IT IS GOD WHO JUSTIFIES

WHO IS TO CONDEMN

CHRIST JESUS IS THE ONE WHO DIEDMORE THAN THAT WHO WAS RAISEDWHO IS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD WHO INDEED IS INTERCEDING FOR US

WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST

SHALL TRIBULATION OR DISTRESS OR PERSECUTION OR FAMINE OR NAKEDNESS OR DANGER OR SWORD

AS IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING KILLED ALL THE DAY LONG; WE ARE REGARDED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED

 NO IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH HIM WHO LOVED US

FOR I AM SURE THAT NEITHER DEATH NOR LIFE NOR ANGELS NOR RULERS NOR THINGS PRESENT NOR THINGS TO COME NOR POWERS NOR HEIGHT NOR DEPTH NOR ANYTHING ELSE IN ALL CREATION WILL BE ABLE TO SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD

I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN CHRISTI AM NOT LYING; MY CONSCIENCE BEARS ME WITNESS IN THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT I HAVE GREAT SORROW AND UNCEASING ANGUISH IN MY HEART

FOR I COULD WISH THAT I MYSELF WERE ACCURSED AND CUT OFF FROM CHRIST FOR THE SAKE OF MY BROTHERS MY KINSMEN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

THEY ARE ISRAELITES AND TO THEM BELONG THE ADOPTION THE GLORY THE COVENANTS THE GIVING OF THE LAW THE WORSHIP AND THE PROMISES

TO THEM BELONG THE PATRIARCHS AND FROM THEIR RACE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH IS THE CHRIST WHO IS GOD OVER ALL BLESSED FOREVER

AMEN

BUT IT IS NOT AS THOUGH THE WORD OF GOD HAS FAILED

FOR NOT ALL WHO ARE DESCENDED FROM ISRAEL BELONG TO ISRAEL AND NOT ALL ARE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS OFFSPRING BUT THROUGH ISAAC SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING BE NAMED

 THIS MEANS THAT IT IS NOT THE CHILDREN OF THE FLESH WHO ARE THE CHILDREN OF GOD BUT THE CHILDREN OF THE PROMISE ARE COUNTED AS OFFSPRING

FOR THIS IS WHAT THE PROMISE SAID ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR I WILL RETURN AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON

 AND NOT ONLY SO BUT ALSO WHEN REBECCA HAD CONCEIVED CHILDREN BY ONE MAN OUR FOREFATHER ISAAC THOUGH THEY WERE NOT YET BORN AND HAD DONE NOTHING EITHER GOOD OR BADIN ORDER THAT GOD'S PURPOSE OF ELECTION MIGHT CONTINUE NOT BECAUSE OF WORKS BUT BECAUSE OF HIS CALL SHE WAS TOLD THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER

 AS IT IS WRITTEN JACOB I LOVED BUT ESAU I HATED

 WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN

IS THERE INJUSTICE ON GOD'S PART

BY NO MEANS

FOR HE SAYS TO MOSES I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION

 SO THEN IT DEPENDS NOT ON HUMAN WILL OR EXERTION BUT ON GOD WHO HAS MERCY

FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS TO PHARAOH FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I HAVE RAISED YOU UP THAT I MIGHT SHOW MY POWER IN YOU AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED IN ALL THE EARTH

 SO THEN HE HAS MERCY ON WHOMEVER HE WILLS AND HE HARDENS WHOMEVER HE WILLS

YOU WILL SAY TO ME THEN WHY DOES HE STILL FIND FAULT

FOR WHO CAN RESIST HIS WILL

 BUT WHO ARE YOU O MAN TO ANSWER BACK TO GOD

WILL WHAT IS MOLDED SAY TO ITS MOLDER WHY HAVE YOU MADE ME LIKE THIS

 HAS THE POTTER NO RIGHT OVER THE CLAY TO MAKE OUT OF THE SAME LUMP ONE VESSEL FOR HONORED USE AND ANOTHER FOR DISHONORABLE USE

WHAT IF GOD DESIRING TO SHOW HIS WRATH AND TO MAKE KNOWN HIS POWER HAS ENDURED WITH MUCH PATIENCE VESSELS OF WRATH PREPARED FOR DESTRUCTION IN ORDER TO MAKE KNOWN THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY FOR VESSELS OF MERCY WHICH HE HAS PREPARED BEFOREHAND FOR GLORY EVEN US WHOM HE HAS CALLED NOT FROM THE JEWS ONLY BUT ALSO FROM THE GENTILES

AS INDEED HE SAYS IN HOSEA THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE I WILL CALL 'MY PEOPLE' AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED I WILL CALL 'BELOVED

' AND IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM 'YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE' THERE THEY WILL BE CALLED 'SONS OF THE LIVING GOD

' AND ISAIAH CRIES OUT CONCERNING ISRAEL THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA ONLY A REMNANT OF THEM WILL BE SAVED FOR THE LORD WILL CARRY OUT HIS SENTENCE UPON THE EARTH FULLY AND WITHOUT DELAY

 AND AS ISAIAH PREDICTED IF THE LORD OF HOSTS HAD NOT LEFT US OFFSPRING WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE SODOM AND BECOME LIKE GOMORRAH

 WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN

THAT GENTILES WHO DID NOT PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS HAVE ATTAINED IT THAT IS A RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT IS BY FAITH; BUT THAT ISRAEL WHO PURSUED A LAW THAT WOULD LEAD TO RIGHTEOUSNESS DID NOT SUCCEED IN REACHING THAT LAW

WHY

BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PURSUE IT BY FAITH BUT AS IF IT WERE BASED ON WORKS

THEY HAVE STUMBLED OVER THE STUMBLING STONE AS IT IS WRITTEN BEHOLD I AM LAYING IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE; AND WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME

BROTHERS MY HEART'S DESIRE AND PRAYER TO GOD FOR THEM IS THAT THEY MAY BE SAVED

I BEAR THEM WITNESS THAT THEY HAVE A ZEAL FOR GOD BUT NOT ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE

FOR BEING IGNORANT OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT COMES FROM GOD AND SEEKING TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN THEY DID NOT SUBMIT TO GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS

FOR CHRIST IS THE END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES

FOR MOSES WRITES ABOUT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT IS BASED ON THE LAW THAT THE PERSON WHO DOES THE COMMANDMENTS SHALL LIVE BY THEM

BUT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS BASED ON FAITH SAYS DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART 'WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN

' THAT IS TO BRING CHRIST DOWN OR 'WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS

' THAT IS TO BRING CHRIST UP FROM THE DEAD

BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY

THE WORD IS NEAR YOU IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART THAT IS THE WORD OF FAITH THAT WE PROCLAIM; BECAUSE IF YOU CONFESS WITH YOUR MOUTH THAT JESUS IS LORD AND BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD YOU WILL BE SAVED

FOR WITH THE HEART ONE BELIEVES AND IS JUSTIFIED AND WITH THE MOUTH ONE CONFESSES AND IS SAVED

FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME

 FOR THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN JEW AND GREEK; THE SAME LORD IS LORD OF ALL BESTOWING HIS RICHES ON ALL WHO CALL ON HIM

FOR EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED

 BUT HOW ARE THEY TO CALL ON HIM IN WHOM THEY HAVE NOT BELIEVED

AND HOW ARE THEY TO BELIEVE IN HIM OF WHOM THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD

AND HOW ARE THEY TO HEAR WITHOUT SOMEONE PREACHING

AND HOW ARE THEY TO PREACH UNLESS THEY ARE SENT

AS IT IS WRITTEN HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO PREACH THE GOOD NEWS

 BUT THEY HAVE NOT ALL OBEYED THE GOSPEL

FOR ISAIAH SAYS LORD WHO HAS BELIEVED WHAT HE HAS HEARD FROM US

 SO FAITH COMES FROM HEARING AND HEARING THROUGH THE WORD OF CHRIST

BUT I ASK HAVE THEY NOT HEARD

INDEED THEY HAVE FOR THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT TO ALL THE EARTH AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD

 BUT I ASK DID ISRAEL NOT UNDERSTAND

FIRST MOSES SAYS I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT A NATION; WITH A FOOLISH NATION I WILL MAKE YOU ANGRY

 THEN ISAIAH IS SO BOLD AS TO SAY I HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME; I HAVE SHOWN MYSELF TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME

 BUT OF ISRAEL HE SAYS ALL DAY LONG I HAVE HELD OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND CONTRARY PEOPLE

I ASK THEN HAS GOD REJECTED HIS PEOPLE

BY NO MEANS

FOR I MYSELF AM AN ISRAELITE A DESCENDANT OF ABRAHAM A MEMBER OF THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN

GOD HAS NOT REJECTED HIS PEOPLE WHOM HE FOREKNEW

DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS OF ELIJAH HOW HE APPEALS TO GOD AGAINST ISRAEL

LORD THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS THEY HAVE DEMOLISHED YOUR ALTARS AND I ALONE AM LEFT AND THEY SEEK MY LIFE

 BUT WHAT IS GOD'S REPLY TO HIM

I HAVE KEPT FOR MYSELF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL

 SO TOO AT THE PRESENT TIME THERE IS A REMNANT CHOSEN BY GRACE

BUT IF IT IS BY GRACE IT IS NO LONGER ON THE BASIS OF WORKS; OTHERWISE GRACE WOULD NO LONGER BE GRACE

WHAT THEN

ISRAEL FAILED TO OBTAIN WHAT IT WAS SEEKING

THE ELECT OBTAINED IT BUT THE REST WERE HARDENED AS IT IS WRITTEN GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR EYES THAT WOULD NOT SEE AND EARS THAT WOULD NOT HEAR DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY

 AND DAVID SAYS LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION FOR THEM; LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER

 SO I ASK DID THEY STUMBLE IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT FALL

BY NO MEANS

RATHER THROUGH THEIR TRESPASS SALVATION HAS COME TO THE GENTILES SO AS TO MAKE ISRAEL JEALOUS

NOW IF THEIR TRESPASS MEANS RICHES FOR THE WORLD AND IF THEIR FAILURE MEANS RICHES FOR THE GENTILES HOW MUCH MORE WILL THEIR FULL INCLUSION MEAN

NOW I AM SPEAKING TO YOU GENTILES

INASMUCH THEN AS I AM AN APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES I MAGNIFY MY MINISTRY IN ORDER SOMEHOW TO MAKE MY FELLOW JEWS JEALOUS AND THUS SAVE SOME OF THEM

FOR IF THEIR REJECTION MEANS THE RECONCILIATION OF THE WORLD WHAT WILL THEIR ACCEPTANCE MEAN BUT LIFE FROM THE DEAD

IF THE DOUGH OFFERED AS FIRSTFRUITS IS HOLY SO IS THE WHOLE LUMP AND IF THE ROOT IS HOLY SO ARE THE BRANCHES

BUT IF SOME OF THE BRANCHES WERE BROKEN OFF AND YOU ALTHOUGH A WILD OLIVE SHOOT WERE GRAFTED IN AMONG THE OTHERS AND NOW SHARE IN THE NOURISHING ROOT OF THE OLIVE TREE DO NOT BE ARROGANT TOWARD THE BRANCHES

IF YOU ARE REMEMBER IT IS NOT YOU WHO SUPPORT THE ROOT BUT THE ROOT THAT SUPPORTS YOU

THEN YOU WILL SAY BRANCHES WERE BROKEN OFF SO THAT I MIGHT BE GRAFTED IN

 THAT IS TRUE

THEY WERE BROKEN OFF BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF BUT YOU STAND FAST THROUGH FAITH

SO DO NOT BECOME PROUD BUT STAND IN AWE

FOR IF GOD DID NOT SPARE THE NATURAL BRANCHES NEITHER WILL HE SPARE YOU

NOTE THEN THE KINDNESS AND THE SEVERITY OF GOD SEVERITY TOWARD THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN BUT GOD'S KINDNESS TO YOU PROVIDED YOU CONTINUE IN HIS KINDNESS

OTHERWISE YOU TOO WILL BE CUT OFF

AND EVEN THEY IF THEY DO NOT CONTINUE IN THEIR UNBELIEF WILL BE GRAFTED IN FOR GOD HAS THE POWER TO GRAFT THEM IN AGAIN

FOR IF YOU WERE CUT FROM WHAT IS BY NATURE A WILD OLIVE TREE AND GRAFTED CONTRARY TO NATURE INTO A CULTIVATED OLIVE TREE HOW MUCH MORE WILL THESE THE NATURAL BRANCHES BE GRAFTED BACK INTO THEIR OWN OLIVE TREE

LEST YOU BE WISE IN YOUR OWN CONCEITS I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS MYSTERY BROTHERS A PARTIAL HARDENING HAS COME UPON ISRAEL UNTIL THE FULLNESS OF THE GENTILES HAS COME IN

AND IN THIS WAY ALL ISRAEL WILL BE SAVED AS IT IS WRITTEN THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION HE WILL BANISH UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB; AND THIS WILL BE MY COVENANT WITH THEM WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS

 AS REGARDS THE GOSPEL THEY ARE ENEMIES OF GOD FOR YOUR SAKE

BUT AS REGARDS ELECTION THEY ARE BELOVED FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR FOREFATHERS

FOR THE GIFTS AND THE CALLING OF GOD ARE IRREVOCABLE

JUST AS YOU WERE AT ONE TIME DISOBEDIENT TO GOD BUT NOW HAVE RECEIVED MERCY BECAUSE OF THEIR DISOBEDIENCE SO THEY TOO HAVE NOW BEEN DISOBEDIENT IN ORDER THAT BY THE MERCY SHOWN TO YOU THEY ALSO MAY NOW RECEIVE MERCY

FOR GOD HAS CONSIGNED ALL TO DISOBEDIENCE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY ON ALL

OH THE DEPTH OF THE RICHES AND WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

HOW UNSEARCHABLE ARE HIS JUDGMENTS AND HOW INSCRUTABLE HIS WAYS

FOR WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD OR WHO HAS BEEN HIS COUNSELOR

 OR WHO HAS GIVEN A GIFT TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE REPAID

 FOR FROM HIM AND THROUGH HIM AND TO HIM ARE ALL THINGS

TO HIM BE GLORY FOREVER

AMEN

I APPEAL TO YOU THEREFORE BROTHERS BY THE MERCIES OF GOD TO PRESENT YOUR BODIES AS A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY AND ACCEPTABLE TO GOD WHICH IS YOUR SPIRITUAL WORSHIP

DO NOT BE CONFORMED TO THIS WORLD BUT BE TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWAL OF YOUR MIND THAT BY TESTING YOU MAY DISCERN WHAT IS THE WILL OF GOD WHAT IS GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE AND PERFECT

FOR BY THE GRACE GIVEN TO ME I SAY TO EVERYONE AMONG YOU NOT TO THINK OF HIMSELF MORE HIGHLY THAN HE OUGHT TO THINK BUT TO THINK WITH SOBER JUDGMENT EACH ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF FAITH THAT GOD HAS ASSIGNED

FOR AS IN ONE BODY WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS AND THE MEMBERS DO NOT ALL HAVE THE SAME FUNCTION SO WE THOUGH MANY ARE ONE BODY IN CHRIST AND INDIVIDUALLY MEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER

HAVING GIFTS THAT DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE GRACE GIVEN TO US LET US USE THEM IF PROPHECY IN PROPORTION TO OUR FAITH; IF SERVICE IN OUR SERVING; THE ONE WHO TEACHES IN HIS TEACHING; THE ONE WHO EXHORTS IN HIS EXHORTATION; THE ONE WHO CONTRIBUTES IN GENEROSITY; THE ONE WHO LEADS WITH ZEAL; THE ONE WHO DOES ACTS OF MERCY WITH CHEERFULNESS

LET LOVE BE GENUINE

ABHOR WHAT IS EVIL; HOLD FAST TO WHAT IS GOOD

LOVE ONE ANOTHER WITH BROTHERLY AFFECTION

OUTDO ONE ANOTHER IN SHOWING HONOR

DO NOT BE SLOTHFUL IN ZEAL BE FERVENT IN SPIRIT SERVE THE LORD

REJOICE IN HOPE BE PATIENT IN TRIBULATION BE CONSTANT IN PRAYER

CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEEDS OF THE SAINTS AND SEEK TO SHOW HOSPITALITY

BLESS THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOU; BLESS AND DO NOT CURSE THEM

REJOICE WITH THOSE WHO REJOICE WEEP WITH THOSE WHO WEEP

LIVE IN HARMONY WITH ONE ANOTHER

DO NOT BE HAUGHTY BUT ASSOCIATE WITH THE LOWLY

NEVER BE CONCEITED

REPAY NO ONE EVIL FOR EVIL BUT GIVE THOUGHT TO DO WHAT IS HONORABLE IN THE SIGHT OF ALL

IF POSSIBLE SO FAR AS IT DEPENDS ON YOU LIVE PEACEABLY WITH ALL

BELOVED NEVER AVENGE YOURSELVES BUT LEAVE IT TO THE WRATH OF GOD FOR IT IS WRITTEN VENGEANCE IS MINE I WILL REPAY SAYS THE LORD

 TO THE CONTRARY IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY FEED HIM; IF HE IS THIRSTY GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DRINK; FOR BY SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD

 DO NOT BE OVERCOME BY EVIL BUT OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD

LET EVERY PERSON BE SUBJECT TO THE GOVERNING AUTHORITIES

FOR THERE IS NO AUTHORITY EXCEPT FROM GOD AND THOSE THAT EXIST HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED BY GOD

THEREFORE WHOEVER RESISTS THE AUTHORITIES RESISTS WHAT GOD HAS APPOINTED AND THOSE WHO RESIST WILL INCUR JUDGMENT

FOR RULERS ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD CONDUCT BUT TO BAD

WOULD YOU HAVE NO FEAR OF THE ONE WHO IS IN AUTHORITY

THEN DO WHAT IS GOOD AND YOU WILL RECEIVE HIS APPROVAL FOR HE IS GOD'S SERVANT FOR YOUR GOOD

BUT IF YOU DO WRONG BE AFRAID FOR HE DOES NOT BEAR THE SWORD IN VAIN

FOR HE IS THE SERVANT OF GOD AN AVENGER WHO CARRIES OUT GOD'S WRATH ON THE WRONGDOER

THEREFORE ONE MUST BE IN SUBJECTION NOT ONLY TO AVOID GOD'S WRATH BUT ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF CONSCIENCE

FOR THE SAME REASON YOU ALSO PAY TAXES FOR THE AUTHORITIES ARE MINISTERS OF GOD ATTENDING TO THIS VERY THING

PAY TO ALL WHAT IS OWED TO THEM TAXES TO WHOM TAXES ARE OWED REVENUE TO WHOM REVENUE IS OWED RESPECT TO WHOM RESPECT IS OWED HONOR TO WHOM HONOR IS OWED

OWE NO ONE ANYTHING EXCEPT TO LOVE EACH OTHER FOR THE ONE WHO LOVES ANOTHER HAS FULFILLED THE LAW

THE COMMANDMENTS YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY YOU SHALL NOT MURDER YOU SHALL NOT STEAL YOU SHALL NOT COVET AND ANY OTHER COMMANDMENT ARE SUMMED UP IN THIS WORD YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

 LOVE DOES NO WRONG TO A NEIGHBOR; THEREFORE LOVE IS THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW

BESIDES THIS YOU KNOW THE TIME THAT THE HOUR HAS COME FOR YOU TO WAKE FROM SLEEP

FOR SALVATION IS NEARER TO US NOW THAN WHEN WE FIRST BELIEVED

THE NIGHT IS FAR GONE; THE DAY IS AT HAND

SO THEN LET US CAST OFF THE WORKS OF DARKNESS AND PUT ON THE ARMOR OF LIGHT

LET US WALK PROPERLY AS IN THE DAYTIME NOT IN ORGIES AND DRUNKENNESS NOT IN SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND SENSUALITY NOT IN QUARRELING AND JEALOUSY

BUT PUT ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND MAKE NO PROVISION FOR THE FLESH TO GRATIFY ITS DESIRES

AS FOR THE ONE WHO IS WEAK IN FAITH WELCOME HIM BUT NOT TO QUARREL OVER OPINIONS

ONE PERSON BELIEVES HE MAY EAT ANYTHING WHILE THE WEAK PERSON EATS ONLY VEGETABLES

LET NOT THE ONE WHO EATS DESPISE THE ONE WHO ABSTAINS AND LET NOT THE ONE WHO ABSTAINS PASS JUDGMENT ON THE ONE WHO EATS FOR GOD HAS WELCOMED HIM

WHO ARE YOU TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE SERVANT OF ANOTHER

IT IS BEFORE HIS OWN MASTER THAT HE STANDS OR FALLS

AND HE WILL BE UPHELD FOR THE LORD IS ABLE TO MAKE HIM STAND

ONE PERSON ESTEEMS ONE DAY AS BETTER THAN ANOTHER WHILE ANOTHER ESTEEMS ALL DAYS ALIKE

EACH ONE SHOULD BE FULLY CONVINCED IN HIS OWN MIND

THE ONE WHO OBSERVES THE DAY OBSERVES IT IN HONOR OF THE LORD

THE ONE WHO EATS EATS IN HONOR OF THE LORD SINCE HE GIVES THANKS TO GOD WHILE THE ONE WHO ABSTAINS ABSTAINS IN HONOR OF THE LORD AND GIVES THANKS TO GOD

FOR NONE OF US LIVES TO HIMSELF AND NONE OF US DIES TO HIMSELF

IF WE LIVE WE LIVE TO THE LORD AND IF WE DIE WE DIE TO THE LORD

SO THEN WHETHER WE LIVE OR WHETHER WE DIE WE ARE THE LORD'S

FOR TO THIS END CHRIST DIED AND LIVED AGAIN THAT HE MIGHT BE LORD BOTH OF THE DEAD AND OF THE LIVING

WHY DO YOU PASS JUDGMENT ON YOUR BROTHER

OR YOU WHY DO YOU DESPISE YOUR BROTHER

FOR WE WILL ALL STAND BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF GOD; FOR IT IS WRITTEN AS I LIVE SAYS THE LORD EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL CONFESS TO GOD

 SO THEN EACH OF US WILL GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF TO GOD

THEREFORE LET US NOT PASS JUDGMENT ON ONE ANOTHER ANY LONGER BUT RATHER DECIDE NEVER TO PUT A STUMBLING BLOCK OR HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF A BROTHER

I KNOW AND AM PERSUADED IN THE LORD JESUS THAT NOTHING IS UNCLEAN IN ITSELF BUT IT IS UNCLEAN FOR ANYONE WHO THINKS IT UNCLEAN

FOR IF YOUR BROTHER IS GRIEVED BY WHAT YOU EAT YOU ARE NO LONGER WALKING IN LOVE

BY WHAT YOU EAT DO NOT DESTROY THE ONE FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED

SO DO NOT LET WHAT YOU REGARD AS GOOD BE SPOKEN OF AS EVIL

FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT A MATTER OF EATING AND DRINKING BUT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE AND JOY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

WHOEVER THUS SERVES CHRIST IS ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND APPROVED BY MEN

SO THEN LET US PURSUE WHAT MAKES FOR PEACE AND FOR MUTUAL UPBUILDING

DO NOT FOR THE SAKE OF FOOD DESTROY THE WORK OF GOD

EVERYTHING IS INDEED CLEAN BUT IT IS WRONG FOR ANYONE TO MAKE ANOTHER STUMBLE BY WHAT HE EATS

IT IS GOOD NOT TO EAT MEAT OR DRINK WINE OR DO ANYTHING THAT CAUSES YOUR BROTHER TO STUMBLE

THE FAITH THAT YOU HAVE KEEP BETWEEN YOURSELF AND GOD

BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO HAS NO REASON TO PASS JUDGMENT ON HIMSELF FOR WHAT HE APPROVES

BUT WHOEVER HAS DOUBTS IS CONDEMNED IF HE EATS BECAUSE THE EATING IS NOT FROM FAITH

FOR WHATEVER DOES NOT PROCEED FROM FAITH IS SIN

WE WHO ARE STRONG HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BEAR WITH THE FAILINGS OF THE WEAK AND NOT TO PLEASE OURSELVES

LET EACH OF US PLEASE HIS NEIGHBOR FOR HIS GOOD TO BUILD HIM UP

FOR CHRIST DID NOT PLEASE HIMSELF BUT AS IT IS WRITTEN THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON ME

 FOR WHATEVER WAS WRITTEN IN FORMER DAYS WAS WRITTEN FOR OUR INSTRUCTION THAT THROUGH ENDURANCE AND THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES WE MIGHT HAVE HOPE

MAY THE GOD OF ENDURANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT GRANT YOU TO LIVE IN SUCH HARMONY WITH ONE ANOTHER IN ACCORD WITH CHRIST JESUS THAT TOGETHER YOU MAY WITH ONE VOICE GLORIFY THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

THEREFORE WELCOME ONE ANOTHER AS CHRIST HAS WELCOMED YOU FOR THE GLORY OF GOD

FOR I TELL YOU THAT CHRIST BECAME A SERVANT TO THE CIRCUMCISED TO SHOW GOD'S TRUTHFULNESS IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THE PROMISES GIVEN TO THE PATRIARCHS AND IN ORDER THAT THE GENTILES MIGHT GLORIFY GOD FOR HIS MERCY

AS IT IS WRITTEN THEREFORE I WILL PRAISE YOU AMONG THE GENTILES AND SING TO YOUR NAME

 AND AGAIN IT IS SAID REJOICE O GENTILES WITH HIS PEOPLE

 AND AGAIN PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES EXTOL HIM

 AND AGAIN ISAIAH SAYS THE ROOT OF JESSE WILL COME EVEN HE WHO ARISES TO RULE THE GENTILES; IN HIM WILL THE GENTILES HOPE

 MAY THE GOD OF HOPE FILL YOU WITH ALL JOY AND PEACE IN BELIEVING SO THAT BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU MAY ABOUND IN HOPE

I MYSELF AM SATISFIED ABOUT YOU MY BROTHERS THAT YOU YOURSELVES ARE FULL OF GOODNESS FILLED WITH ALL KNOWLEDGE AND ABLE TO INSTRUCT ONE ANOTHER

BUT ON SOME POINTS I HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU VERY BOLDLY BY WAY OF REMINDER BECAUSE OF THE GRACE GIVEN ME BY GOD TO BE A MINISTER OF CHRIST JESUS TO THE GENTILES IN THE PRIESTLY SERVICE OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD SO THAT THE OFFERING OF THE GENTILES MAY BE ACCEPTABLE SANCTIFIED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT

IN CHRIST JESUS THEN I HAVE REASON TO BE PROUD OF MY WORK FOR GOD

FOR I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT CHRIST HAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH ME TO BRING THE GENTILES TO OBEDIENCEBY WORD AND DEED BY THE POWER OF SIGNS AND WONDERS BY THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GODSO THAT FROM JERUSALEM AND ALL THE WAY AROUND TO ILLYRICUM I HAVE FULFILLED THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST; AND THUS I MAKE IT MY AMBITION TO PREACH THE GOSPEL NOT WHERE CHRIST HAS ALREADY BEEN NAMED LEST I BUILD ON SOMEONE ELSE'S FOUNDATION BUT AS IT IS WRITTEN THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD OF HIM WILL SEE AND THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND

 THIS IS THE REASON WHY I HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN HINDERED FROM COMING TO YOU

BUT NOW SINCE I NO LONGER HAVE ANY ROOM FOR WORK IN THESE REGIONS AND SINCE I HAVE LONGED FOR MANY YEARS TO COME TO YOU I HOPE TO SEE YOU IN PASSING AS I GO TO SPAIN AND TO BE HELPED ON MY JOURNEY THERE BY YOU ONCE I HAVE ENJOYED YOUR COMPANY FOR A WHILE

AT PRESENT HOWEVER I AM GOING TO JERUSALEM BRINGING AID TO THE SAINTS

FOR MACEDONIA AND ACHAIA HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION FOR THE POOR AMONG THE SAINTS AT JERUSALEM

THEY WERE PLEASED TO DO IT AND INDEED THEY OWE IT TO THEM

FOR IF THE GENTILES HAVE COME TO SHARE IN THEIR SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS THEY OUGHT ALSO TO BE OF SERVICE TO THEM IN MATERIAL BLESSINGS

WHEN THEREFORE I HAVE COMPLETED THIS AND HAVE DELIVERED TO THEM WHAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED I WILL LEAVE FOR SPAIN BY WAY OF YOU

I KNOW THAT WHEN I COME TO YOU I WILL COME IN THE FULLNESS OF THE BLESSING OF CHRIST

I APPEAL TO YOU BROTHERS BY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND BY THE LOVE OF THE SPIRIT TO STRIVE TOGETHER WITH ME IN YOUR PRAYERS TO GOD ON MY BEHALF THAT I MAY BE DELIVERED FROM THE UNBELIEVERS IN JUDEA AND THAT MY SERVICE FOR JERUSALEM MAY BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE SAINTS SO THAT BY GOD'S WILL I MAY COME TO YOU WITH JOY AND BE REFRESHED IN YOUR COMPANY

MAY THE GOD OF PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL

AMEN

I COMMEND TO YOU OUR SISTER PHOEBE A SERVANT OF THE CHURCH AT CENCHREAE THAT YOU MAY WELCOME HER IN THE LORD IN A WAY WORTHY OF THE SAINTS AND HELP HER IN WHATEVER SHE MAY NEED FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS BEEN A PATRON OF MANY AND OF MYSELF AS WELL

ALL THE CHURCHES OF CHRIST GREET YOU

I APPEAL TO YOU BROTHERS TO WATCH OUT FOR THOSE WHO CAUSE DIVISIONS AND CREATE OBSTACLES CONTRARY TO THE DOCTRINE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT; AVOID THEM

FOR SUCH PERSONS DO NOT SERVE OUR LORD CHRIST BUT THEIR OWN APPETITES AND BY SMOOTH TALK AND FLATTERY THEY DECEIVE THE HEARTS OF THE NAIVE

FOR YOUR OBEDIENCE IS KNOWN TO ALL SO THAT I REJOICE OVER YOU BUT I WANT YOU TO BE WISE AS TO WHAT IS GOOD AND INNOCENT AS TO WHAT IS EVIL

THE GOD OF PEACE WILL SOON CRUSH SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET

THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOU

TIMOTHY MY FELLOW WORKER GREETS YOU; SO DO LUCIUS AND JASON AND SOSIPATER MY KINSMEN

AMEN

 CORINTHIANSPAUL AN APOSTLE OF CHRIST JESUS BY THE WILL OF GOD AND TIMOTHY OUR BROTHERTO THE CHURCH OF GOD THAT IS AT CORINTH WITH ALL THE SAINTS WHO ARE IN THE WHOLE OF ACHAIA GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THE FATHER OF MERCIES AND GOD OF ALL COMFORT WHO COMFORTS US IN ALL OUR AFFLICTION SO THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO COMFORT THOSE WHO ARE IN ANY AFFLICTION WITH THE COMFORT WITH WHICH WE OURSELVES ARE COMFORTED BY GOD

FOR AS WE SHARE ABUNDANTLY IN CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS SO THROUGH CHRIST WE SHARE ABUNDANTLY IN COMFORT TOO

IF WE ARE AFFLICTED IT IS FOR YOUR COMFORT AND SALVATION; AND IF WE ARE COMFORTED IT IS FOR YOUR COMFORT WHICH YOU EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU PATIENTLY ENDURE THE SAME SUFFERINGS THAT WE SUFFER

OUR HOPE FOR YOU IS UNSHAKEN FOR WE KNOW THAT AS YOU SHARE IN OUR SUFFERINGS YOU WILL ALSO SHARE IN OUR COMFORT

FOR WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE IGNORANT BROTHERS OF THE AFFLICTION WE EXPERIENCED IN ASIA

FOR WE WERE SO UTTERLY BURDENED BEYOND OUR STRENGTH THAT WE DESPAIRED OF LIFE ITSELF

INDEED WE FELT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED THE SENTENCE OF DEATH

BUT THAT WAS TO MAKE US RELY NOT ON OURSELVES BUT ON GOD WHO RAISES THE DEAD

HE DELIVERED US FROM SUCH A DEADLY PERIL AND HE WILL DELIVER US

ON HIM WE HAVE SET OUR HOPE THAT HE WILL DELIVER US AGAIN

YOU ALSO MUST HELP US BY PRAYER SO THAT MANY WILL GIVE THANKS ON OUR BEHALF FOR THE BLESSING GRANTED US THROUGH THE PRAYERS OF MANY

FOR OUR BOAST IS THIS THE TESTIMONY OF OUR CONSCIENCE THAT WE BEHAVED IN THE WORLD WITH SIMPLICITY AND GODLY SINCERITY NOT BY EARTHLY WISDOM BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND SUPREMELY SO TOWARD YOU

FOR WE ARE NOT WRITING TO YOU ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND I HOPE YOU WILL FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE JUST AS YOU DID PARTIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE US THAT ON THE DAY OF OUR LORD JESUS YOU WILL BOAST OF US AS WE WILL BOAST OF YOU

BECAUSE I WAS SURE OF THIS I WANTED TO COME TO YOU FIRST SO THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A SECOND EXPERIENCE OF GRACE

I WANTED TO VISIT YOU ON MY WAY TO MACEDONIA AND TO COME BACK TO YOU FROM MACEDONIA AND HAVE YOU SEND ME ON MY WAY TO JUDEA

WAS I VACILLATING WHEN I WANTED TO DO THIS

DO I MAKE MY PLANS ACCORDING TO THE FLESH READY TO SAY YES YES AND NO NO AT THE SAME TIME

AS SURELY AS GOD IS FAITHFUL OUR WORD TO YOU HAS NOT BEEN YES AND NO

FOR THE SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST WHOM WE PROCLAIMED AMONG YOU SILVANUS AND TIMOTHY AND I WAS NOT YES AND NO BUT IN HIM IT IS ALWAYS YES

FOR ALL THE PROMISES OF GOD FIND THEIR YES IN HIM

THAT IS WHY IT IS THROUGH HIM THAT WE UTTER OUR AMEN TO GOD FOR HIS GLORY

AND IT IS GOD WHO ESTABLISHES US WITH YOU IN CHRIST AND HAS ANOINTED US AND WHO HAS ALSO PUT HIS SEAL ON US AND GIVEN US HIS SPIRIT IN OUR HEARTS AS A GUARANTEE

BUT I CALL GOD TO WITNESS AGAINST MEIT WAS TO SPARE YOU THAT I REFRAINED FROM COMING AGAIN TO CORINTH

NOT THAT WE LORD IT OVER YOUR FAITH BUT WE WORK WITH YOU FOR YOUR JOY FOR YOU STAND FIRM IN YOUR FAITH

FOR I MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO MAKE ANOTHER PAINFUL VISIT TO YOU

FOR IF I CAUSE YOU PAIN WHO IS THERE TO MAKE ME GLAD BUT THE ONE WHOM I HAVE PAINED

AND I WROTE AS I DID SO THAT WHEN I CAME I MIGHT NOT SUFFER PAIN FROM THOSE WHO SHOULD HAVE MADE ME REJOICE FOR I FELT SURE OF ALL OF YOU THAT MY JOY WOULD BE THE JOY OF YOU ALL

FOR I WROTE TO YOU OUT OF MUCH AFFLICTION AND ANGUISH OF HEART AND WITH MANY TEARS NOT TO CAUSE YOU PAIN BUT TO LET YOU KNOW THE ABUNDANT LOVE THAT I HAVE FOR YOU

NOW IF ANYONE HAS CAUSED PAIN HE HAS CAUSED IT NOT TO ME BUT IN SOME MEASURENOT TO PUT IT TOO SEVERELYTO ALL OF YOU

FOR SUCH A ONE THIS PUNISHMENT BY THE MAJORITY IS ENOUGH SO YOU SHOULD RATHER TURN TO FORGIVE AND COMFORT HIM OR HE MAY BE OVERWHELMED BY EXCESSIVE SORROW

SO I BEG YOU TO REAFFIRM YOUR LOVE FOR HIM

FOR THIS IS WHY I WROTE THAT I MIGHT TEST YOU AND KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE OBEDIENT IN EVERYTHING

ANYONE WHOM YOU FORGIVE I ALSO FORGIVE

WHAT I HAVE FORGIVEN IF I HAVE FORGIVEN ANYTHING HAS BEEN FOR YOUR SAKE IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST SO THAT WE WOULD NOT BE OUTWITTED BY SATAN; FOR WE ARE NOT IGNORANT OF HIS DESIGNS

WHEN I CAME TO TROAS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST EVEN THOUGH A DOOR WAS OPENED FOR ME IN THE LORD MY SPIRIT WAS NOT AT REST BECAUSE I DID NOT FIND MY BROTHER TITUS THERE

SO I TOOK LEAVE OF THEM AND WENT ON TO MACEDONIA

BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHO IN CHRIST ALWAYS LEADS US IN TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION AND THROUGH US SPREADS THE FRAGRANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM EVERYWHERE

FOR WE ARE THE AROMA OF CHRIST TO GOD AMONG THOSE WHO ARE BEING SAVED AND AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PERISHING TO ONE A FRAGRANCE FROM DEATH TO DEATH TO THE OTHER A FRAGRANCE FROM LIFE TO LIFE

WHO IS SUFFICIENT FOR THESE THINGS

FOR WE ARE NOT LIKE SO MANY PEDDLERS OF GOD'S WORD BUT AS MEN OF SINCERITY AS COMMISSIONED BY GOD IN THE SIGHT OF GOD WE SPEAK IN CHRIST

ARE WE BEGINNING TO COMMEND OURSELVES AGAIN

OR DO WE NEED AS SOME DO LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION TO YOU OR FROM YOU

YOU YOURSELVES ARE OUR LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WRITTEN ON OUR HEARTS TO BE KNOWN AND READ BY ALL

AND YOU SHOW THAT YOU ARE A LETTER FROM CHRIST DELIVERED BY US WRITTEN NOT WITH INK BUT WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD NOT ON TABLETS OF STONE BUT ON TABLETS OF HUMAN HEARTS

SUCH IS THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE THROUGH CHRIST TOWARD GOD

NOT THAT WE ARE SUFFICIENT IN OURSELVES TO CLAIM ANYTHING AS COMING FROM US BUT OUR SUFFICIENCY IS FROM GOD WHO HAS MADE US COMPETENT TO BE MINISTERS OF A NEW COVENANT NOT OF THE LETTER BUT OF THE SPIRIT

FOR THE LETTER KILLS BUT THE SPIRIT GIVES LIFE

NOW IF THE MINISTRY OF DEATH CARVED IN LETTERS ON STONE CAME WITH SUCH GLORY THAT THE ISRAELITES COULD NOT GAZE AT MOSES' FACE BECAUSE OF ITS GLORY WHICH WAS BEING BROUGHT TO AN END WILL NOT THE MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT HAVE EVEN MORE GLORY

FOR IF THERE WAS GLORY IN THE MINISTRY OF CONDEMNATION THE MINISTRY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS MUST FAR EXCEED IT IN GLORY

INDEED IN THIS CASE WHAT ONCE HAD GLORY HAS COME TO HAVE NO GLORY AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE GLORY THAT SURPASSES IT

FOR IF WHAT WAS BEING BROUGHT TO AN END CAME WITH GLORY MUCH MORE WILL WHAT IS PERMANENT HAVE GLORY

SINCE WE HAVE SUCH A HOPE WE ARE VERY BOLD NOT LIKE MOSES WHO WOULD PUT A VEIL OVER HIS FACE SO THAT THE ISRAELITES MIGHT NOT GAZE AT THE OUTCOME OF WHAT WAS BEING BROUGHT TO AN END

BUT THEIR MINDS WERE HARDENED

FOR TO THIS DAY WHEN THEY READ THE OLD COVENANT THAT SAME VEIL REMAINS UNLIFTED BECAUSE ONLY THROUGH CHRIST IS IT TAKEN AWAY

YES TO THIS DAY WHENEVER MOSES IS READ A VEIL LIES OVER THEIR HEARTS

BUT WHEN ONE TURNS TO THE LORD THE VEIL IS REMOVED

NOW THE LORD IS THE SPIRIT AND WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS THERE IS FREEDOM

AND WE ALL WITH UNVEILED FACE BEHOLDING THE GLORY OF THE LORD ARE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE SAME IMAGE FROM ONE DEGREE OF GLORY TO ANOTHER

FOR THIS COMES FROM THE LORD WHO IS THE SPIRIT

THEREFORE HAVING THIS MINISTRY BY THE MERCY OF GOD WE DO NOT LOSE HEART

BUT WE HAVE RENOUNCED DISGRACEFUL UNDERHANDED WAYS

WE REFUSE TO PRACTICE CUNNING OR TO TAMPER WITH GOD'S WORD BUT BY THE OPEN STATEMENT OF THE TRUTH WE WOULD COMMEND OURSELVES TO EVERYONE'S CONSCIENCE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

AND EVEN IF OUR GOSPEL IS VEILED IT IS VEILED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PERISHING

IN THEIR CASE THE GOD OF THIS WORLD HAS BLINDED THE MINDS OF THE UNBELIEVERS TO KEEP THEM FROM SEEING THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL OF THE GLORY OF CHRIST WHO IS THE IMAGE OF GOD

FOR WHAT WE PROCLAIM IS NOT OURSELVES BUT JESUS CHRIST AS LORD WITH OURSELVES AS YOUR SERVANTS FOR JESUS' SAKE

FOR GOD WHO SAID LET LIGHT SHINE OUT OF DARKNESS HAS SHONE IN OUR HEARTS TO GIVE THE LIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF GOD IN THE FACE OF JESUS CHRIST

BUT WE HAVE THIS TREASURE IN JARS OF CLAY TO SHOW THAT THE SURPASSING POWER BELONGS TO GOD AND NOT TO US

WE ARE AFFLICTED IN EVERY WAY BUT NOT CRUSHED; PERPLEXED BUT NOT DRIVEN TO DESPAIR; PERSECUTED BUT NOT FORSAKEN; STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED; ALWAYS CARRYING IN THE BODY THE DEATH OF JESUS SO THAT THE LIFE OF JESUS MAY ALSO BE MANIFESTED IN OUR BODIES

FOR WE WHO LIVE ARE ALWAYS BEING GIVEN OVER TO DEATH FOR JESUS' SAKE SO THAT THE LIFE OF JESUS ALSO MAY BE MANIFESTED IN OUR MORTAL FLESH

SO DEATH IS AT WORK IN US BUT LIFE IN YOU

SINCE WE HAVE THE SAME SPIRIT OF FAITH ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN I BELIEVED AND SO I SPOKE WE ALSO BELIEVE AND SO WE ALSO SPEAK KNOWING THAT HE WHO RAISED THE LORD JESUS WILL RAISE US ALSO WITH JESUS AND BRING US WITH YOU INTO HIS PRESENCE

FOR IT IS ALL FOR YOUR SAKE SO THAT AS GRACE EXTENDS TO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IT MAY INCREASE THANKSGIVING TO THE GLORY OF GOD

SO WE DO NOT LOSE HEART

THOUGH OUR OUTER NATURE IS WASTING AWAY OUR INNER NATURE IS BEING RENEWED DAY BY DAY

FOR THIS SLIGHT MOMENTARY AFFLICTION IS PREPARING FOR US AN ETERNAL WEIGHT OF GLORY BEYOND ALL COMPARISON AS WE LOOK NOT TO THE THINGS THAT ARE SEEN BUT TO THE THINGS THAT ARE UNSEEN

FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE SEEN ARE TRANSIENT BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE UNSEEN ARE ETERNAL

FOR WE KNOW THAT IF THE TENT WHICH IS OUR EARTHLY HOME IS DESTROYED WE HAVE A BUILDING FROM GOD A HOUSE NOT MADE WITH HANDS ETERNAL IN THE HEAVENS

FOR IN THIS TENT WE GROAN LONGING TO PUT ON OUR HEAVENLY DWELLING IF INDEED BY PUTTING IT ON WE MAY NOT BE FOUND NAKED

FOR WHILE WE ARE STILL IN THIS TENT WE GROAN BEING BURDENEDNOT THAT WE WOULD BE UNCLOTHED BUT THAT WE WOULD BE FURTHER CLOTHED SO THAT WHAT IS MORTAL MAY BE SWALLOWED UP BY LIFE

HE WHO HAS PREPARED US FOR THIS VERY THING IS GOD WHO HAS GIVEN US THE SPIRIT AS A GUARANTEE

SO WE ARE ALWAYS OF GOOD COURAGE

WE KNOW THAT WHILE WE ARE AT HOME IN THE BODY WE ARE AWAY FROM THE LORD FOR WE WALK BY FAITH NOT BY SIGHT

YES WE ARE OF GOOD COURAGE AND WE WOULD RATHER BE AWAY FROM THE BODY AND AT HOME WITH THE LORD

SO WHETHER WE ARE AT HOME OR AWAY WE MAKE IT OUR AIM TO PLEASE HIM

FOR WE MUST ALL APPEAR BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST SO THAT EACH ONE MAY RECEIVE WHAT IS DUE FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IN THE BODY WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL

THEREFORE KNOWING THE FEAR OF THE LORD WE PERSUADE OTHERS

BUT WHAT WE ARE IS KNOWN TO GOD AND I HOPE IT IS KNOWN ALSO TO YOUR CONSCIENCE

WE ARE NOT COMMENDING OURSELVES TO YOU AGAIN BUT GIVING YOU CAUSE TO BOAST ABOUT US SO THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE WHO BOAST ABOUT OUTWARD APPEARANCE AND NOT ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE HEART

FOR IF WE ARE BESIDE OURSELVES IT IS FOR GOD; IF WE ARE IN OUR RIGHT MIND IT IS FOR YOU

FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST CONTROLS US BECAUSE WE HAVE CONCLUDED THIS THAT ONE HAS DIED FOR ALL THEREFORE ALL HAVE DIED; AND HE DIED FOR ALL THAT THOSE WHO LIVE MIGHT NO LONGER LIVE FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR HIM WHO FOR THEIR SAKE DIED AND WAS RAISED

FROM NOW ON THEREFORE WE REGARD NO ONE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

EVEN THOUGH WE ONCE REGARDED CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE FLESH WE REGARD HIM THUS NO LONGER

THEREFORE IF ANYONE IS IN CHRIST HE IS A NEW CREATION

THE OLD HAS PASSED AWAY; BEHOLD THE NEW HAS COME

ALL THIS IS FROM GOD WHO THROUGH CHRIST RECONCILED US TO HIMSELF AND GAVE US THE MINISTRY OF RECONCILIATION; THAT IS IN CHRIST GOD WAS RECONCILING THE WORLD TO HIMSELF NOT COUNTING THEIR TRESPASSES AGAINST THEM AND ENTRUSTING TO US THE MESSAGE OF RECONCILIATION

THEREFORE WE ARE AMBASSADORS FOR CHRIST GOD MAKING HIS APPEAL THROUGH US

WE IMPLORE YOU ON BEHALF OF CHRIST BE RECONCILED TO GOD

FOR OUR SAKE HE MADE HIM TO BE SIN WHO KNEW NO SIN SO THAT IN HIM WE MIGHT BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD

WORKING TOGETHER WITH HIM THEN WE APPEAL TO YOU NOT TO RECEIVE THE GRACE OF GOD IN VAIN

FOR HE SAYS IN A FAVORABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU AND IN A DAY OF SALVATION I HAVE HELPED YOU

BEHOLD NOW IS THE FAVORABLE TIME; BEHOLD NOW IS THE DAY OF SALVATION

WE PUT NO OBSTACLE IN ANYONE'S WAY SO THAT NO FAULT MAY BE FOUND WITH OUR MINISTRY BUT AS SERVANTS OF GOD WE COMMEND OURSELVES IN EVERY WAY BY GREAT ENDURANCE IN AFFLICTIONS HARDSHIPS CALAMITIES BEATINGS IMPRISONMENTS RIOTS LABORS SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HUNGER; BY PURITY KNOWLEDGE PATIENCE KINDNESS THE HOLY SPIRIT GENUINE LOVE; BY TRUTHFUL SPEECH AND THE POWER OF GOD; WITH THE WEAPONS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THE RIGHT HAND AND FOR THE LEFT; THROUGH HONOR AND DISHONOR THROUGH SLANDER AND PRAISE

WE ARE TREATED AS IMPOSTORS AND YET ARE TRUE; AS UNKNOWN AND YET WELL KNOWN; AS DYING AND BEHOLD WE LIVE; AS PUNISHED AND YET NOT KILLED; AS SORROWFUL YET ALWAYS REJOICING; AS POOR YET MAKING MANY RICH; AS HAVING NOTHING YET POSSESSING EVERYTHING

WE HAVE SPOKEN FREELY TO YOU CORINTHIANS; OUR HEART IS WIDE OPEN

YOU ARE NOT RESTRICTED BY US BUT YOU ARE RESTRICTED IN YOUR OWN AFFECTIONS

IN RETURN I SPEAK AS TO CHILDREN WIDEN YOUR HEARTS ALSO

DO NOT BE UNEQUALLY YOKED WITH UNBELIEVERS

FOR WHAT PARTNERSHIP HAS RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH LAWLESSNESS

OR WHAT FELLOWSHIP HAS LIGHT WITH DARKNESS

WHAT ACCORD HAS CHRIST WITH BELIAL

OR WHAT PORTION DOES A BELIEVER SHARE WITH AN UNBELIEVER

WHAT AGREEMENT HAS THE TEMPLE OF GOD WITH IDOLS

FOR WE ARE THE TEMPLE OF THE LIVING GOD; AS GOD SAID I WILL MAKE MY DWELLING AMONG THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE

THEREFORE GO OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE FROM THEM SAYS THE LORD AND TOUCH NO UNCLEAN THING; THEN I WILL WELCOME YOU AND I WILL BE A FATHER TO YOU AND YOU SHALL BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO ME SAYS THE LORD ALMIGHTY

SINCE WE HAVE THESE PROMISES BELOVED LET US CLEANSE OURSELVES FROM EVERY DEFILEMENT OF BODY AND SPIRIT BRINGING HOLINESS TO COMPLETION IN THE FEAR OF GOD

MAKE ROOM IN YOUR HEARTS FOR US

WE HAVE WRONGED NO ONE WE HAVE CORRUPTED NO ONE WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF NO ONE

I DO NOT SAY THIS TO CONDEMN YOU FOR I SAID BEFORE THAT YOU ARE IN OUR HEARTS TO DIE TOGETHER AND TO LIVE TOGETHER

I AM ACTING WITH GREAT BOLDNESS TOWARD YOU; I HAVE GREAT PRIDE IN YOU; I AM FILLED WITH COMFORT

IN ALL OUR AFFLICTION I AM OVERFLOWING WITH JOY

FOR EVEN WHEN WE CAME INTO MACEDONIA OUR BODIES HAD NO REST BUT WE WERE AFFLICTED AT EVERY TURNFIGHTING WITHOUT AND FEAR WITHIN

BUT GOD WHO COMFORTS THE DOWNCAST COMFORTED US BY THE COMING OF TITUS AND NOT ONLY BY HIS COMING BUT ALSO BY THE COMFORT WITH WHICH HE WAS COMFORTED BY YOU AS HE TOLD US OF YOUR LONGING YOUR MOURNING YOUR ZEAL FOR ME SO THAT I REJOICED STILL MORE

FOR EVEN IF I MADE YOU GRIEVE WITH MY LETTER I DO NOT REGRET ITTHOUGH I DID REGRET IT FOR I SEE THAT THAT LETTER GRIEVED YOU THOUGH ONLY FOR A WHILE

AS IT IS I REJOICE NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE GRIEVED BUT BECAUSE YOU WERE GRIEVED INTO REPENTING

FOR YOU FELT A GODLY GRIEF SO THAT YOU SUFFERED NO LOSS THROUGH US

FOR GODLY GRIEF PRODUCES A REPENTANCE THAT LEADS TO SALVATION WITHOUT REGRET WHEREAS WORLDLY GRIEF PRODUCES DEATH

FOR SEE WHAT EARNESTNESS THIS GODLY GRIEF HAS PRODUCED IN YOU BUT ALSO WHAT EAGERNESS TO CLEAR YOURSELVES WHAT INDIGNATION WHAT FEAR WHAT LONGING WHAT ZEAL WHAT PUNISHMENT

AT EVERY POINT YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELVES INNOCENT IN THE MATTER

SO ALTHOUGH I WROTE TO YOU IT WAS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE WHO DID THE WRONG NOR FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE WHO SUFFERED THE WRONG BUT IN ORDER THAT YOUR EARNESTNESS FOR US MIGHT BE REVEALED TO YOU IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

THEREFORE WE ARE COMFORTED

AND BESIDES OUR OWN COMFORT WE REJOICED STILL MORE AT THE JOY OF TITUS BECAUSE HIS SPIRIT HAS BEEN REFRESHED BY YOU ALL

FOR WHATEVER BOASTS I MADE TO HIM ABOUT YOU I WAS NOT PUT TO SHAME

BUT JUST AS EVERYTHING WE SAID TO YOU WAS TRUE SO ALSO OUR BOASTING BEFORE TITUS HAS PROVED TRUE

AND HIS AFFECTION FOR YOU IS EVEN GREATER AS HE REMEMBERS THE OBEDIENCE OF YOU ALL HOW YOU RECEIVED HIM WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING

I REJOICE BECAUSE I HAVE PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN YOU

WE WANT YOU TO KNOW BROTHERS ABOUT THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AMONG THE CHURCHES OF MACEDONIA FOR IN A SEVERE TEST OF AFFLICTION THEIR ABUNDANCE OF JOY AND THEIR EXTREME POVERTY HAVE OVERFLOWED IN A WEALTH OF GENEROSITY ON THEIR PART

FOR THEY GAVE ACCORDING TO THEIR MEANS AS I CAN TESTIFY AND BEYOND THEIR MEANS OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL BEGGING US EARNESTLY FOR THE FAVOR OF TAKING PART IN THE RELIEF OF THE SAINTS AND THIS NOT AS WE EXPECTED BUT THEY GAVE THEMSELVES FIRST TO THE LORD AND THEN BY THE WILL OF GOD TO US

ACCORDINGLY WE URGED TITUS THAT AS HE HAD STARTED SO HE SHOULD COMPLETE AMONG YOU THIS ACT OF GRACE

BUT AS YOU EXCEL IN EVERYTHINGIN FAITH IN SPEECH IN KNOWLEDGE IN ALL EARNESTNESS AND IN OUR LOVE FOR YOUSEE THAT YOU EXCEL IN THIS ACT OF GRACE ALSO

I SAY THIS NOT AS A COMMAND BUT TO PROVE BY THE EARNESTNESS OF OTHERS THAT YOUR LOVE ALSO IS GENUINE

FOR YOU KNOW THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT THOUGH HE WAS RICH YET FOR YOUR SAKE HE BECAME POOR SO THAT YOU BY HIS POVERTY MIGHT BECOME RICH

AND IN THIS MATTER I GIVE MY JUDGMENT THIS BENEFITS YOU WHO A YEAR AGO STARTED NOT ONLY TO DO THIS WORK BUT ALSO TO DESIRE TO DO IT

SO NOW FINISH DOING IT AS WELL SO THAT YOUR READINESS IN DESIRING IT MAY BE MATCHED BY YOUR COMPLETING IT OUT OF WHAT YOU HAVE

FOR IF THE READINESS IS THERE IT IS ACCEPTABLE ACCORDING TO WHAT A PERSON HAS NOT ACCORDING TO WHAT HE DOES NOT HAVE

I DO NOT MEAN THAT OTHERS SHOULD BE EASED AND YOU BURDENED BUT THAT AS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS YOUR ABUNDANCE AT THE PRESENT TIME SHOULD SUPPLY THEIR NEED SO THAT THEIR ABUNDANCE MAY SUPPLY YOUR NEED THAT THERE MAY BE FAIRNESS

AS IT IS WRITTEN WHOEVER GATHERED MUCH HAD NOTHING LEFT OVER AND WHOEVER GATHERED LITTLE HAD NO LACK

 BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHO PUT INTO THE HEART OF TITUS THE SAME EARNEST CARE I HAVE FOR YOU

FOR HE NOT ONLY ACCEPTED OUR APPEAL BUT BEING HIMSELF VERY EARNEST HE IS GOING TO YOU OF HIS OWN ACCORD

WITH HIM WE ARE SENDING THE BROTHER WHO IS FAMOUS AMONG ALL THE CHURCHES FOR HIS PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL

AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT HE HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE CHURCHES TO TRAVEL WITH US AS WE CARRY OUT THIS ACT OF GRACE THAT IS BEING MINISTERED BY US FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD HIMSELF AND TO SHOW OUR GOOD WILL

WE TAKE THIS COURSE SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD BLAME US ABOUT THIS GENEROUS GIFT THAT IS BEING ADMINISTERED BY US FOR WE AIM AT WHAT IS HONORABLE NOT ONLY IN THE LORD'S SIGHT BUT ALSO IN THE SIGHT OF MAN

AND WITH THEM WE ARE SENDING OUR BROTHER WHOM WE HAVE OFTEN TESTED AND FOUND EARNEST IN MANY MATTERS BUT WHO IS NOW MORE EARNEST THAN EVER BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT CONFIDENCE IN YOU

AS FOR TITUS HE IS MY PARTNER AND FELLOW WORKER FOR YOUR BENEFIT

AND AS FOR OUR BROTHERS THEY ARE MESSENGERS OF THE CHURCHES THE GLORY OF CHRIST

SO GIVE PROOF BEFORE THE CHURCHES OF YOUR LOVE AND OF OUR BOASTING ABOUT YOU TO THESE MEN

NOW IT IS SUPERFLUOUS FOR ME TO WRITE TO YOU ABOUT THE MINISTRY FOR THE SAINTS FOR I KNOW YOUR READINESS OF WHICH I BOAST ABOUT YOU TO THE PEOPLE OF MACEDONIA SAYING THAT ACHAIA HAS BEEN READY SINCE LAST YEAR

AND YOUR ZEAL HAS STIRRED UP MOST OF THEM

BUT I AM SENDING THE BROTHERS SO THAT OUR BOASTING ABOUT YOU MAY NOT PROVE VAIN IN THIS MATTER SO THAT YOU MAY BE READY AS I SAID YOU WOULD BE

OTHERWISE IF SOME MACEDONIANS COME WITH ME AND FIND THAT YOU ARE NOT READY WE WOULD BE HUMILIATEDTO SAY NOTHING OF YOUFOR BEING SO CONFIDENT

SO I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO URGE THE BROTHERS TO GO ON AHEAD TO YOU AND ARRANGE IN ADVANCE FOR THE GIFT YOU HAVE PROMISED SO THAT IT MAY BE READY AS A WILLING GIFT NOT AS AN EXACTION

THE POINT IS THIS WHOEVER SOWS SPARINGLY WILL ALSO REAP SPARINGLY AND WHOEVER SOWS BOUNTIFULLY WILL ALSO REAP BOUNTIFULLY

EACH ONE MUST GIVE AS HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND NOT RELUCTANTLY OR UNDER COMPULSION FOR GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER

AND GOD IS ABLE TO MAKE ALL GRACE ABOUND TO YOU SO THAT HAVING ALL SUFFICIENCY IN ALL THINGS AT ALL TIMES YOU MAY ABOUND IN EVERY GOOD WORK

AS IT IS WRITTEN HE HAS DISTRIBUTED FREELY HE HAS GIVEN TO THE POOR; HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ENDURES FOREVER

 HE WHO SUPPLIES SEED TO THE SOWER AND BREAD FOR FOOD WILL SUPPLY AND MULTIPLY YOUR SEED FOR SOWING AND INCREASE THE HARVEST OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

YOU WILL BE ENRICHED IN EVERY WAY FOR ALL YOUR GENEROSITY WHICH THROUGH US WILL PRODUCE THANKSGIVING TO GOD

FOR THE MINISTRY OF THIS SERVICE IS NOT ONLY SUPPLYING THE NEEDS OF THE SAINTS BUT IS ALSO OVERFLOWING IN MANY THANKSGIVINGS TO GOD

BY THEIR APPROVAL OF THIS SERVICE THEY WILL GLORIFY GOD BECAUSE OF YOUR SUBMISSION FLOWING FROM YOUR CONFESSION OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST AND THE GENEROSITY OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION FOR THEM AND FOR ALL OTHERS WHILE THEY LONG FOR YOU AND PRAY FOR YOU BECAUSE OF THE SURPASSING GRACE OF GOD UPON YOU

THANKS BE TO GOD FOR HIS INEXPRESSIBLE GIFT

I PAUL MYSELF ENTREAT YOU BY THE MEEKNESS AND GENTLENESS OF CHRISTI WHO AM HUMBLE WHEN FACE TO FACE WITH YOU BUT BOLD TOWARD YOU WHEN I AM AWAY

 I BEG OF YOU THAT WHEN I AM PRESENT I MAY NOT HAVE TO SHOW BOLDNESS WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE AS I COUNT ON SHOWING AGAINST SOME WHO SUSPECT US OF WALKING ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

FOR THOUGH WE WALK IN THE FLESH WE ARE NOT WAGING WAR ACCORDING TO THE FLESH

FOR THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE ARE NOT OF THE FLESH BUT HAVE DIVINE POWER TO DESTROY STRONGHOLDS

WE DESTROY ARGUMENTS AND EVERY LOFTY OPINION RAISED AGAINST THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND TAKE EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE TO OBEY CHRIST BEING READY TO PUNISH EVERY DISOBEDIENCE WHEN YOUR OBEDIENCE IS COMPLETE

LOOK AT WHAT IS BEFORE YOUR EYES

IF ANYONE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE IS CHRIST'S LET HIM REMIND HIMSELF THAT JUST AS HE IS CHRIST'S SO ALSO ARE WE

FOR EVEN IF I BOAST A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF OUR AUTHORITY WHICH THE LORD GAVE FOR BUILDING YOU UP AND NOT FOR DESTROYING YOU I WILL NOT BE ASHAMED

I DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE FRIGHTENING YOU WITH MY LETTERS

FOR THEY SAY HIS LETTERS ARE WEIGHTY AND STRONG BUT HIS BODILY PRESENCE IS WEAK AND HIS SPEECH OF NO ACCOUNT

 LET SUCH A PERSON UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE SAY BY LETTER WHEN ABSENT WE DO WHEN PRESENT

NOT THAT WE DARE TO CLASSIFY OR COMPARE OURSELVES WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE COMMENDING THEMSELVES

BUT WHEN THEY MEASURE THEMSELVES BY ONE ANOTHER AND COMPARE THEMSELVES WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY ARE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

BUT WE WILL NOT BOAST BEYOND LIMITS BUT WILL BOAST ONLY WITH REGARD TO THE AREA OF INFLUENCE GOD ASSIGNED TO US TO REACH EVEN TO YOU

FOR WE ARE NOT OVEREXTENDING OURSELVES AS THOUGH WE DID NOT REACH YOU

WE WERE THE FIRST TO COME ALL THE WAY TO YOU WITH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST

WE DO NOT BOAST BEYOND LIMIT IN THE LABORS OF OTHERS

BUT OUR HOPE IS THAT AS YOUR FAITH INCREASES OUR AREA OF INFLUENCE AMONG YOU MAY BE GREATLY ENLARGED SO THAT WE MAY PREACH THE GOSPEL IN LANDS BEYOND YOU WITHOUT BOASTING OF WORK ALREADY DONE IN ANOTHER'S AREA OF INFLUENCE

LET THE ONE WHO BOASTS BOAST IN THE LORD

 FOR IT IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMMENDS HIMSELF WHO IS APPROVED BUT THE ONE WHOM THE LORD COMMENDS

I WISH YOU WOULD BEAR WITH ME IN A LITTLE FOOLISHNESS

DO BEAR WITH ME

I FEEL A DIVINE JEALOUSY FOR YOU FOR I BETROTHED YOU TO ONE HUSBAND TO PRESENT YOU AS A PURE VIRGIN TO CHRIST

BUT I AM AFRAID THAT AS THE SERPENT DECEIVED EVE BY HIS CUNNING YOUR THOUGHTS WILL BE LED ASTRAY FROM A SINCERE AND PURE DEVOTION TO CHRIST

FOR IF SOMEONE COMES AND PROCLAIMS ANOTHER JESUS THAN THE ONE WE PROCLAIMED OR IF YOU RECEIVE A DIFFERENT SPIRIT FROM THE ONE YOU RECEIVED OR IF YOU ACCEPT A DIFFERENT GOSPEL FROM THE ONE YOU ACCEPTED YOU PUT UP WITH IT READILY ENOUGH

I CONSIDER THAT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST INFERIOR TO THESE SUPERAPOSTLES

EVEN IF I AM UNSKILLED IN SPEAKING I AM NOT SO IN KNOWLEDGE; INDEED IN EVERY WAY WE HAVE MADE THIS PLAIN TO YOU IN ALL THINGS

OR DID I COMMIT A SIN IN HUMBLING MYSELF SO THAT YOU MIGHT BE EXALTED BECAUSE I PREACHED GOD'S GOSPEL TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE

I ROBBED OTHER CHURCHES BY ACCEPTING SUPPORT FROM THEM IN ORDER TO SERVE YOU

AND WHEN I WAS WITH YOU AND WAS IN NEED I DID NOT BURDEN ANYONE FOR THE BROTHERS WHO CAME FROM MACEDONIA SUPPLIED MY NEED

SO I REFRAINED AND WILL REFRAIN FROM BURDENING YOU IN ANY WAY

AS THE TRUTH OF CHRIST IS IN ME THIS BOASTING OF MINE WILL NOT BE SILENCED IN THE REGIONS OF ACHAIA

AND WHY

BECAUSE I DO NOT LOVE YOU

GOD KNOWS I DO

AND WHAT I DO I WILL CONTINUE TO DO IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE THE CLAIM OF THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO CLAIM THAT IN THEIR BOASTED MISSION THEY WORK ON THE SAME TERMS AS WE DO

FOR SUCH MEN ARE FALSE APOSTLES DECEITFUL WORKMEN DISGUISING THEMSELVES AS APOSTLES OF CHRIST

AND NO WONDER FOR EVEN SATAN DISGUISES HIMSELF AS AN ANGEL OF LIGHT

SO IT IS NO SURPRISE IF HIS SERVANTS ALSO DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS SERVANTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

THEIR END WILL CORRESPOND TO THEIR DEEDS

I REPEAT LET NO ONE THINK ME FOOLISH

BUT EVEN IF YOU DO ACCEPT ME AS A FOOL SO THAT I TOO MAY BOAST A LITTLE

WHAT I AM SAYING WITH THIS BOASTFUL CONFIDENCE I SAY NOT WITH THE LORD'S AUTHORITY BUT AS A FOOL

SINCE MANY BOAST ACCORDING TO THE FLESH I TOO WILL BOAST

FOR YOU GLADLY BEAR WITH FOOLS BEING WISE YOURSELVES

FOR YOU BEAR IT IF SOMEONE MAKES SLAVES OF YOU OR DEVOURS YOU OR TAKES ADVANTAGE OF YOU OR PUTS ON AIRS OR STRIKES YOU IN THE FACE

TO MY SHAME I MUST SAY WE WERE TOO WEAK FOR THAT

BUT WHATEVER ANYONE ELSE DARES TO BOAST OFI AM SPEAKING AS A FOOLI ALSO DARE TO BOAST OF THAT

ARE THEY HEBREWS

SO AM I

ARE THEY ISRAELITES

SO AM I

ARE THEY OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM

SO AM I

ARE THEY SERVANTS OF CHRIST

I AM A BETTER ONEI AM TALKING LIKE A MADMANWITH FAR GREATER LABORS FAR MORE IMPRISONMENTS WITH COUNTLESS BEATINGS AND OFTEN NEAR DEATH

FIVE TIMES I RECEIVED AT THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE FORTY LASHES LESS ONE

THREE TIMES I WAS BEATEN WITH RODS

ONCE I WAS STONED

THREE TIMES I WAS SHIPWRECKED; A NIGHT AND A DAY I WAS ADRIFT AT SEA; ON FREQUENT JOURNEYS IN DANGER FROM RIVERS DANGER FROM ROBBERS DANGER FROM MY OWN PEOPLE DANGER FROM GENTILES DANGER IN THE CITY DANGER IN THE WILDERNESS DANGER AT SEA DANGER FROM FALSE BROTHERS; IN TOIL AND HARDSHIP THROUGH MANY A SLEEPLESS NIGHT IN HUNGER AND THIRST OFTEN WITHOUT FOOD IN COLD AND EXPOSURE

AND APART FROM OTHER THINGS THERE IS THE DAILY PRESSURE ON ME OF MY ANXIETY FOR ALL THE CHURCHES

WHO IS WEAK AND I AM NOT WEAK

WHO IS MADE TO FALL AND I AM NOT INDIGNANT

IF I MUST BOAST I WILL BOAST OF THE THINGS THAT SHOW MY WEAKNESS

THE GOD AND FATHER OF THE LORD JESUS HE WHO IS BLESSED FOREVER KNOWS THAT I AM NOT LYING

AT DAMASCUS THE GOVERNOR UNDER KING ARETAS WAS GUARDING THE CITY OF DAMASCUS IN ORDER TO SEIZE ME BUT I WAS LET DOWN IN A BASKET THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE WALL AND ESCAPED HIS HANDS

I MUST GO ON BOASTING

THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT I WILL GO ON TO VISIONS AND REVELATIONS OF THE LORD

I KNOW A MAN IN CHRIST WHO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO WAS CAUGHT UP TO THE THIRD HEAVENWHETHER IN THE BODY OR OUT OF THE BODY I DO NOT KNOW GOD KNOWS

AND I KNOW THAT THIS MAN WAS CAUGHT UP INTO PARADISEWHETHER IN THE BODY OR OUT OF THE BODY I DO NOT KNOW GOD KNOWS AND HE HEARD THINGS THAT CANNOT BE TOLD WHICH MAN MAY NOT UTTER

ON BEHALF OF THIS MAN I WILL BOAST BUT ON MY OWN BEHALF I WILL NOT BOAST EXCEPT OF MY WEAKNESSES

THOUGH IF I SHOULD WISH TO BOAST I WOULD NOT BE A FOOL FOR I WOULD BE SPEAKING THE TRUTH

BUT I REFRAIN FROM IT SO THAT NO ONE MAY THINK MORE OF ME THAN HE SEES IN ME OR HEARS FROM ME

SO TO KEEP ME FROM BEING TOO ELATED BY THE SURPASSING GREATNESS OF THE REVELATIONS A THORN WAS GIVEN ME IN THE FLESH A MESSENGER OF SATAN TO HARASS ME TO KEEP ME FROM BEING TOO ELATED

THREE TIMES I PLEADED WITH THE LORD ABOUT THIS THAT IT SHOULD LEAVE ME

BUT HE SAID TO ME MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU FOR MY POWER IS MADE PERFECT IN WEAKNESS

 THEREFORE I WILL BOAST ALL THE MORE GLADLY OF MY WEAKNESSES SO THAT THE POWER OF CHRIST MAY REST UPON ME

FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST THEN I AM CONTENT WITH WEAKNESSES INSULTS HARDSHIPS PERSECUTIONS AND CALAMITIES

FOR WHEN I AM WEAK THEN I AM STRONG

I HAVE BEEN A FOOL

YOU FORCED ME TO IT FOR I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN COMMENDED BY YOU

FOR I WAS NOT AT ALL INFERIOR TO THESE SUPERAPOSTLES EVEN THOUGH I AM NOTHING

THE SIGNS OF A TRUE APOSTLE WERE PERFORMED AMONG YOU WITH UTMOST PATIENCE WITH SIGNS AND WONDERS AND MIGHTY WORKS

FOR IN WHAT WERE YOU LESS FAVORED THAN THE REST OF THE CHURCHES EXCEPT THAT I MYSELF DID NOT BURDEN YOU

FORGIVE ME THIS WRONG

HERE FOR THE THIRD TIME I AM READY TO COME TO YOU

AND I WILL NOT BE A BURDEN FOR I SEEK NOT WHAT IS YOURS BUT YOU

FOR CHILDREN ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO SAVE UP FOR THEIR PARENTS BUT PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN

I WILL MOST GLADLY SPEND AND BE SPENT FOR YOUR SOULS

IF I LOVE YOU MORE AM I TO BE LOVED LESS

BUT GRANTING THAT I MYSELF DID NOT BURDEN YOU I WAS CRAFTY YOU SAY AND GOT THE BETTER OF YOU BY DECEIT

DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU THROUGH ANY OF THOSE WHOM I SENT TO YOU

I URGED TITUS TO GO AND SENT THE BROTHER WITH HIM

DID TITUS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU

DID WE NOT ACT IN THE SAME SPIRIT

DID WE NOT TAKE THE SAME STEPS

HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ALL ALONG THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEFENDING OURSELVES TO YOU

IT IS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD THAT WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN CHRIST AND ALL FOR YOUR UPBUILDING BELOVED

FOR I FEAR THAT PERHAPS WHEN I COME I MAY FIND YOU NOT AS I WISH AND THAT YOU MAY FIND ME NOT AS YOU WISHTHAT PERHAPS THERE MAY BE QUARRELING JEALOUSY ANGER HOSTILITY SLANDER GOSSIP CONCEIT AND DISORDER

I FEAR THAT WHEN I COME AGAIN MY GOD MAY HUMBLE ME BEFORE YOU AND I MAY HAVE TO MOURN OVER MANY OF THOSE WHO SINNED EARLIER AND HAVE NOT REPENTED OF THE IMPURITY SEXUAL IMMORALITY AND SENSUALITY THAT THEY HAVE PRACTICED

THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I AM COMING TO YOU

EVERY CHARGE MUST BE ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES

I WARNED THOSE WHO SINNED BEFORE AND ALL THE OTHERS AND I WARN THEM NOW WHILE ABSENT AS I DID WHEN PRESENT ON MY SECOND VISIT THAT IF I COME AGAIN I WILL NOT SPARE THEM SINCE YOU SEEK PROOF THAT CHRIST IS SPEAKING IN ME

HE IS NOT WEAK IN DEALING WITH YOU BUT IS POWERFUL AMONG YOU

FOR HE WAS CRUCIFIED IN WEAKNESS BUT LIVES BY THE POWER OF GOD

FOR WE ALSO ARE WEAK IN HIM BUT IN DEALING WITH YOU WE WILL LIVE WITH HIM BY THE POWER OF GOD

EXAMINE YOURSELVES TO SEE WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE FAITH

TEST YOURSELVES

OR DO YOU NOT REALIZE THIS ABOUT YOURSELVES THAT JESUS CHRIST IS IN YOU

UNLESS INDEED YOU FAIL TO MEET THE TEST

I HOPE YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE NOT FAILED THE TEST

BUT WE PRAY TO GOD THAT YOU MAY NOT DO WRONGNOT THAT WE MAY APPEAR TO HAVE MET THE TEST BUT THAT YOU MAY DO WHAT IS RIGHT THOUGH WE MAY SEEM TO HAVE FAILED

FOR WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST THE TRUTH BUT ONLY FOR THE TRUTH

FOR WE ARE GLAD WHEN WE ARE WEAK AND YOU ARE STRONG

YOUR RESTORATION IS WHAT WE PRAY FOR

FOR THIS REASON I WRITE THESE THINGS WHILE I AM AWAY FROM YOU THAT WHEN I COME I MAY NOT HAVE TO BE SEVERE IN MY USE OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN ME FOR BUILDING UP AND NOT FOR TEARING DOWN

FINALLY BROTHERS REJOICE

AIM FOR RESTORATION COMFORT ONE ANOTHER AGREE WITH ONE ANOTHER LIVE IN PEACE; AND THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE WILL BE WITH YOU

GREET ONE ANOTHER WITH A HOLY KISS

ALL THE SAINTS GREET YOU

THE GRACE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BE WITH YOU ALL

HEBREWSLONG AGO AT MANY TIMES AND IN MANY WAYS GOD SPOKE TO OUR FATHERS BY THE PROPHETS BUT IN THESE LAST DAYS HE HAS SPOKEN TO US BY HIS SON WHOM HE APPOINTED THE HEIR OF ALL THINGS THROUGH WHOM ALSO HE CREATED THE WORLD

HE IS THE RADIANCE OF THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE EXACT IMPRINT OF HIS NATURE AND HE UPHOLDS THE UNIVERSE BY THE WORD OF HIS POWER

AFTER MAKING PURIFICATION FOR SINS HE SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE MAJESTY ON HIGH HAVING BECOME AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO ANGELS AS THE NAME HE HAS INHERITED IS MORE EXCELLENT THAN THEIRS

FOR TO WHICH OF THE ANGELS DID GOD EVER SAY YOU ARE MY SON TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU

OR AGAIN I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON

AND AGAIN WHEN HE BRINGS THE FIRSTBORN INTO THE WORLD HE SAYS LET ALL GOD'S ANGELS WORSHIP HIM

 OF THE ANGELS HE SAYS HE MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE

 BUT OF THE SON HE SAYS YOUR THRONE O GOD IS FOREVER AND EVER THE SCEPTER OF UPRIGHTNESS IS THE SCEPTER OF YOUR KINGDOM

YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED WICKEDNESS; THEREFORE GOD YOUR GOD HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS BEYOND YOUR COMPANIONS

 AND YOU LORD LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH IN THE BEGINNING AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS; THEY WILL PERISH BUT YOU REMAIN; THEY WILL ALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT LIKE A ROBE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL BE CHANGED

BUT YOU ARE THE SAME AND YOUR YEARS WILL HAVE NO END

 AND TO WHICH OF THE ANGELS HAS HE EVER SAID SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET

ARE THEY NOT ALL MINISTERING SPIRITS SENT OUT TO SERVE FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE WHO ARE TO INHERIT SALVATION

THEREFORE WE MUST PAY MUCH CLOSER ATTENTION TO WHAT WE HAVE HEARD LEST WE DRIFT AWAY FROM IT

FOR SINCE THE MESSAGE DECLARED BY ANGELS PROVED TO BE RELIABLE AND EVERY TRANSGRESSION OR DISOBEDIENCE RECEIVED A JUST RETRIBUTION HOW SHALL WE ESCAPE IF WE NEGLECT SUCH A GREAT SALVATION

IT WAS DECLARED AT FIRST BY THE LORD AND IT WAS ATTESTED TO US BY THOSE WHO HEARD WHILE GOD ALSO BORE WITNESS BY SIGNS AND WONDERS AND VARIOUS MIRACLES AND BY GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO HIS WILL

NOW IT WAS NOT TO ANGELS THAT GOD SUBJECTED THE WORLD TO COME OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING

IT HAS BEEN TESTIFIED SOMEWHERE WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM OR THE SON OF MAN THAT YOU CARE FOR HIM

YOU MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR PUTTING EVERYTHING IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET

NOW IN PUTTING EVERYTHING IN SUBJECTION TO HIM HE LEFT NOTHING OUTSIDE HIS CONTROL

AT PRESENT WE DO NOT YET SEE EVERYTHING IN SUBJECTION TO HIM

BUT WE SEE HIM WHO FOR A LITTLE WHILE WAS MADE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS NAMELY JESUS CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR BECAUSE OF THE SUFFERING OF DEATH SO THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD HE MIGHT TASTE DEATH FOR EVERYONE

FOR IT WAS FITTING THAT HE FOR WHOM AND BY WHOM ALL THINGS EXIST IN BRINGING MANY SONS TO GLORY SHOULD MAKE THE FOUNDER OF THEIR SALVATION PERFECT THROUGH SUFFERING

FOR HE WHO SANCTIFIES AND THOSE WHO ARE SANCTIFIED ALL HAVE ONE ORIGIN

THAT IS WHY HE IS NOT ASHAMED TO CALL THEM BROTHERS SAYING I WILL TELL OF YOUR NAME TO MY BROTHERS; IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE

 AND AGAIN I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM

AND AGAIN BEHOLD I AND THE CHILDREN GOD HAS GIVEN ME

 SINCE THEREFORE THE CHILDREN SHARE IN FLESH AND BLOOD HE HIMSELF LIKEWISE PARTOOK OF THE SAME THINGS THAT THROUGH DEATH HE MIGHT DESTROY THE ONE WHO HAS THE POWER OF DEATH THAT IS THE DEVIL AND DELIVER ALL THOSE WHO THROUGH FEAR OF DEATH WERE SUBJECT TO LIFELONG SLAVERY

FOR SURELY IT IS NOT ANGELS THAT HE HELPS BUT HE HELPS THE OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM

THEREFORE HE HAD TO BE MADE LIKE HIS BROTHERS IN EVERY RESPECT SO THAT HE MIGHT BECOME A MERCIFUL AND FAITHFUL HIGH PRIEST IN THE SERVICE OF GOD TO MAKE PROPITIATION FOR THE SINS OF THE PEOPLE

FOR BECAUSE HE HIMSELF HAS SUFFERED WHEN TEMPTED HE IS ABLE TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE BEING TEMPTED

THEREFORE HOLY BROTHERS YOU WHO SHARE IN A HEAVENLY CALLING CONSIDER JESUS THE APOSTLE AND HIGH PRIEST OF OUR CONFESSION WHO WAS FAITHFUL TO HIM WHO APPOINTED HIM JUST AS MOSES ALSO WAS FAITHFUL IN ALL GOD'S HOUSE

FOR JESUS HAS BEEN COUNTED WORTHY OF MORE GLORY THAN MOSESAS MUCH MORE GLORY AS THE BUILDER OF A HOUSE HAS MORE HONOR THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF

FOR EVERY HOUSE IS BUILT BY SOMEONE BUT THE BUILDER OF ALL THINGS IS GOD

 NOW MOSES WAS FAITHFUL IN ALL GOD'S HOUSE AS A SERVANT TO TESTIFY TO THE THINGS THAT WERE TO BE SPOKEN LATER BUT CHRIST IS FAITHFUL OVER GOD'S HOUSE AS A SON

AND WE ARE HIS HOUSE IF INDEED WE HOLD FAST OUR CONFIDENCE AND OUR BOASTING IN OUR HOPE

THEREFORE AS THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS IN THE REBELLION ON THE DAY OF TESTING IN THE WILDERNESS WHERE YOUR FATHERS PUT ME TO THE TEST AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS

THEREFORE I WAS PROVOKED WITH THAT GENERATION AND SAID 'THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART; THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN MY WAYS

' AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST

' TAKE CARE BROTHERS LEST THERE BE IN ANY OF YOU AN EVIL UNBELIEVING HEART LEADING YOU TO FALL AWAY FROM THE LIVING GOD

BUT EXHORT ONE ANOTHER EVERY DAY AS LONG AS IT IS CALLED TODAY THAT NONE OF YOU MAY BE HARDENED BY THE DECEITFULNESS OF SIN

FOR WE SHARE IN CHRIST IF INDEED WE HOLD OUR ORIGINAL CONFIDENCE FIRM TO THE END

AS IT IS SAID TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS IN THE REBELLION

 FOR WHO WERE THOSE WHO HEARD AND YET REBELLED

WAS IT NOT ALL THOSE WHO LEFT EGYPT LED BY MOSES

AND WITH WHOM WAS HE PROVOKED FOR FORTY YEARS

WAS IT NOT WITH THOSE WHO SINNED WHOSE BODIES FELL IN THE WILDERNESS

AND TO WHOM DID HE SWEAR THAT THEY WOULD NOT ENTER HIS REST BUT TO THOSE WHO WERE DISOBEDIENT

SO WE SEE THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO ENTER BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF

THEREFORE WHILE THE PROMISE OF ENTERING HIS REST STILL STANDS LET US FEAR LEST ANY OF YOU SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE FAILED TO REACH IT

FOR GOOD NEWS CAME TO US JUST AS TO THEM BUT THE MESSAGE THEY HEARD DID NOT BENEFIT THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT UNITED BY FAITH WITH THOSE WHO LISTENED

FOR WE WHO HAVE BELIEVED ENTER THAT REST AS HE HAS SAID AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST'ALTHOUGH HIS WORKS WERE FINISHED FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD

FOR HE HAS SOMEWHERE SPOKEN OF THE SEVENTH DAY IN THIS WAY AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS

 AND AGAIN IN THIS PASSAGE HE SAID THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST

 SINCE THEREFORE IT REMAINS FOR SOME TO ENTER IT AND THOSE WHO FORMERLY RECEIVED THE GOOD NEWS FAILED TO ENTER BECAUSE OF DISOBEDIENCE AGAIN HE APPOINTS A CERTAIN DAY TODAY SAYING THROUGH DAVID SO LONG AFTERWARD IN THE WORDS ALREADY QUOTED TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS

 FOR IF JOSHUA HAD GIVEN THEM REST GOD WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN OF ANOTHER DAY LATER ON

SO THEN THERE REMAINS A SABBATH REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD FOR WHOEVER HAS ENTERED GOD'S REST HAS ALSO RESTED FROM HIS WORKS AS GOD DID FROM HIS

LET US THEREFORE STRIVE TO ENTER THAT REST SO THAT NO ONE MAY FALL BY THE SAME SORT OF DISOBEDIENCE

FOR THE WORD OF GOD IS LIVING AND ACTIVE SHARPER THAN ANY TWOEDGED SWORD PIERCING TO THE DIVISION OF SOUL AND OF SPIRIT OF JOINTS AND OF MARROW AND DISCERNING THE THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS OF THE HEART

AND NO CREATURE IS HIDDEN FROM HIS SIGHT BUT ALL ARE NAKED AND EXPOSED TO THE EYES OF HIM TO WHOM WE MUST GIVE ACCOUNT

SINCE THEN WE HAVE A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHO HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEAVENS JESUS THE SON OF GOD LET US HOLD FAST OUR CONFESSION

FOR WE DO NOT HAVE A HIGH PRIEST WHO IS UNABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH OUR WEAKNESSES BUT ONE WHO IN EVERY RESPECT HAS BEEN TEMPTED AS WE ARE YET WITHOUT SIN

LET US THEN WITH CONFIDENCE DRAW NEAR TO THE THRONE OF GRACE THAT WE MAY RECEIVE MERCY AND FIND GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED

FOR EVERY HIGH PRIEST CHOSEN FROM AMONG MEN IS APPOINTED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF MEN IN RELATION TO GOD TO OFFER GIFTS AND SACRIFICES FOR SINS

HE CAN DEAL GENTLY WITH THE IGNORANT AND WAYWARD SINCE HE HIMSELF IS BESET WITH WEAKNESS

BECAUSE OF THIS HE IS OBLIGATED TO OFFER SACRIFICE FOR HIS OWN SINS JUST AS HE DOES FOR THOSE OF THE PEOPLE

AND NO ONE TAKES THIS HONOR FOR HIMSELF BUT ONLY WHEN CALLED BY GOD JUST AS AARON WAS

SO ALSO CHRIST DID NOT EXALT HIMSELF TO BE MADE A HIGH PRIEST BUT WAS APPOINTED BY HIM WHO SAID TO HIM YOU ARE MY SON TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU; AS HE SAYS ALSO IN ANOTHER PLACE YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK

 IN THE DAYS OF HIS FLESH JESUS OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND SUPPLICATIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO HIM WHO WAS ABLE TO SAVE HIM FROM DEATH AND HE WAS HEARD BECAUSE OF HIS REVERENCE

ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE THROUGH WHAT HE SUFFERED

AND BEING MADE PERFECT HE BECAME THE SOURCE OF ETERNAL SALVATION TO ALL WHO OBEY HIM BEING DESIGNATED BY GOD A HIGH PRIEST AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK

ABOUT THIS WE HAVE MUCH TO SAY AND IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN SINCE YOU HAVE BECOME DULL OF HEARING

FOR THOUGH BY THIS TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TEACHERS YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TEACH YOU AGAIN THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE ORACLES OF GOD

YOU NEED MILK NOT SOLID FOOD FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES ON MILK IS UNSKILLED IN THE WORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS SINCE HE IS A CHILD

BUT SOLID FOOD IS FOR THE MATURE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR POWERS OF DISCERNMENT TRAINED BY CONSTANT PRACTICE TO DISTINGUISH GOOD FROM EVIL

THEREFORE LET US LEAVE THE ELEMENTARY DOCTRINE OF CHRIST AND GO ON TO MATURITY NOT LAYING AGAIN A FOUNDATION OF REPENTANCE FROM DEAD WORKS AND OF FAITH TOWARD GOD AND OF INSTRUCTION ABOUT WASHINGS THE LAYING ON OF HANDS THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD AND ETERNAL JUDGMENT

AND THIS WE WILL DO IF GOD PERMITS

FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTORE AGAIN TO REPENTANCE THOSE WHO HAVE ONCE BEEN ENLIGHTENED WHO HAVE TASTED THE HEAVENLY GIFT AND HAVE SHARED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT AND HAVE TASTED THE GOODNESS OF THE WORD OF GOD AND THE POWERS OF THE AGE TO COME IF THEY THEN FALL AWAY SINCE THEY ARE CRUCIFYING ONCE AGAIN THE SON OF GOD TO THEIR OWN HARM AND HOLDING HIM UP TO CONTEMPT

FOR LAND THAT HAS DRUNK THE RAIN THAT OFTEN FALLS ON IT AND PRODUCES A CROP USEFUL TO THOSE FOR WHOSE SAKE IT IS CULTIVATED RECEIVES A BLESSING FROM GOD

BUT IF IT BEARS THORNS AND THISTLES IT IS WORTHLESS AND NEAR TO BEING CURSED AND ITS END IS TO BE BURNED

THOUGH WE SPEAK IN THIS WAY YET IN YOUR CASE BELOVED WE FEEL SURE OF BETTER THINGSTHINGS THAT BELONG TO SALVATION

FOR GOD IS NOT SO UNJUST AS TO OVERLOOK YOUR WORK AND THE LOVE THAT YOU SHOWED FOR HIS SAKE IN SERVING THE SAINTS AS YOU STILL DO

AND WE DESIRE EACH ONE OF YOU TO SHOW THE SAME EARNESTNESS TO HAVE THE FULL ASSURANCE OF HOPE UNTIL THE END SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BE SLUGGISH BUT IMITATORS OF THOSE WHO THROUGH FAITH AND PATIENCE INHERIT THE PROMISES

FOR WHEN GOD MADE A PROMISE TO ABRAHAM SINCE HE HAD NO ONE GREATER BY WHOM TO SWEAR HE SWORE BY HIMSELF SAYING SURELY I WILL BLESS YOU AND MULTIPLY YOU

 AND THUS ABRAHAM HAVING PATIENTLY WAITED OBTAINED THE PROMISE

FOR PEOPLE SWEAR BY SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES AND IN ALL THEIR DISPUTES AN OATH IS FINAL FOR CONFIRMATION

SO WHEN GOD DESIRED TO SHOW MORE CONVINCINGLY TO THE HEIRS OF THE PROMISE THE UNCHANGEABLE CHARACTER OF HIS PURPOSE HE GUARANTEED IT WITH AN OATH SO THAT BY TWO UNCHANGEABLE THINGS IN WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD TO LIE WE WHO HAVE FLED FOR REFUGE MIGHT HAVE STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT TO HOLD FAST TO THE HOPE SET BEFORE US

WE HAVE THIS AS A SURE AND STEADFAST ANCHOR OF THE SOUL A HOPE THAT ENTERS INTO THE INNER PLACE BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHERE JESUS HAS GONE AS A FORERUNNER ON OUR BEHALF HAVING BECOME A HIGH PRIEST FOREVER AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK

FOR THIS MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD MET ABRAHAM RETURNING FROM THE SLAUGHTER OF THE KINGS AND BLESSED HIM AND TO HIM ABRAHAM APPORTIONED A TENTH PART OF EVERYTHING

HE IS FIRST BY TRANSLATION OF HIS NAME KING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THEN HE IS ALSO KING OF SALEM THAT IS KING OF PEACE

HE IS WITHOUT FATHER OR MOTHER OR GENEALOGY HAVING NEITHER BEGINNING OF DAYS NOR END OF LIFE BUT RESEMBLING THE SON OF GOD HE CONTINUES A PRIEST FOREVER

SEE HOW GREAT THIS MAN WAS TO WHOM ABRAHAM THE PATRIARCH GAVE A TENTH OF THE SPOILS

AND THOSE DESCENDANTS OF LEVI WHO RECEIVE THE PRIESTLY OFFICE HAVE A COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW TO TAKE TITHES FROM THE PEOPLE THAT IS FROM THEIR BROTHERS THOUGH THESE ALSO ARE DESCENDED FROM ABRAHAM

BUT THIS MAN WHO DOES NOT HAVE HIS DESCENT FROM THEM RECEIVED TITHES FROM ABRAHAM AND BLESSED HIM WHO HAD THE PROMISES

IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT THE INFERIOR IS BLESSED BY THE SUPERIOR

IN THE ONE CASE TITHES ARE RECEIVED BY MORTAL MEN BUT IN THE OTHER CASE BY ONE OF WHOM IT IS TESTIFIED THAT HE LIVES

ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT LEVI HIMSELF WHO RECEIVES TITHES PAID TITHES THROUGH ABRAHAM FOR HE WAS STILL IN THE LOINS OF HIS ANCESTOR WHEN MELCHIZEDEK MET HIM

NOW IF PERFECTION HAD BEEN ATTAINABLE THROUGH THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD FOR UNDER IT THE PEOPLE RECEIVED THE LAW WHAT FURTHER NEED WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN FOR ANOTHER PRIEST TO ARISE AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK RATHER THAN ONE NAMED AFTER THE ORDER OF AARON

FOR WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE PRIESTHOOD THERE IS NECESSARILY A CHANGE IN THE LAW AS WELL

FOR THE ONE OF WHOM THESE THINGS ARE SPOKEN BELONGED TO ANOTHER TRIBE FROM WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER SERVED AT THE ALTAR

FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT OUR LORD WAS DESCENDED FROM JUDAH AND IN CONNECTION WITH THAT TRIBE MOSES SAID NOTHING ABOUT PRIESTS

THIS BECOMES EVEN MORE EVIDENT WHEN ANOTHER PRIEST ARISES IN THE LIKENESS OF MELCHIZEDEK WHO HAS BECOME A PRIEST NOT ON THE BASIS OF A LEGAL REQUIREMENT CONCERNING BODILY DESCENT BUT BY THE POWER OF AN INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE

FOR IT IS WITNESSED OF HIM YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK

 ON THE ONE HAND A FORMER COMMANDMENT IS SET ASIDE BECAUSE OF ITS WEAKNESS AND USELESSNESS FOR THE LAW MADE NOTHING PERFECT; BUT ON THE OTHER HAND A BETTER HOPE IS INTRODUCED THROUGH WHICH WE DRAW NEAR TO GOD

AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT AN OATH

FOR THOSE WHO FORMERLY BECAME PRIESTS WERE MADE SUCH WITHOUT AN OATH BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE A PRIEST WITH AN OATH BY THE ONE WHO SAID TO HIM THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND 'YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER

' THIS MAKES JESUS THE GUARANTOR OF A BETTER COVENANT

THE FORMER PRIESTS WERE MANY IN NUMBER BECAUSE THEY WERE PREVENTED BY DEATH FROM CONTINUING IN OFFICE BUT HE HOLDS HIS PRIESTHOOD PERMANENTLY BECAUSE HE CONTINUES FOREVER

CONSEQUENTLY HE IS ABLE TO SAVE TO THE UTTERMOST THOSE WHO DRAW NEAR TO GOD THROUGH HIM SINCE HE ALWAYS LIVES TO MAKE INTERCESSION FOR THEM

FOR IT WAS INDEED FITTING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A HIGH PRIEST HOLY INNOCENT UNSTAINED SEPARATED FROM SINNERS AND EXALTED ABOVE THE HEAVENS

HE HAS NO NEED LIKE THOSE HIGH PRIESTS TO OFFER SACRIFICES DAILY FIRST FOR HIS OWN SINS AND THEN FOR THOSE OF THE PEOPLE SINCE HE DID THIS ONCE FOR ALL WHEN HE OFFERED UP HIMSELF

FOR THE LAW APPOINTS MEN IN THEIR WEAKNESS AS HIGH PRIESTS BUT THE WORD OF THE OATH WHICH CAME LATER THAN THE LAW APPOINTS A SON WHO HAS BEEN MADE PERFECT FOREVER

NOW THE POINT IN WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THIS WE HAVE SUCH A HIGH PRIEST ONE WHO IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE THRONE OF THE MAJESTY IN HEAVEN A MINISTER IN THE HOLY PLACES IN THE TRUE TENT THAT THE LORD SET UP NOT MAN

FOR EVERY HIGH PRIEST IS APPOINTED TO OFFER GIFTS AND SACRIFICES; THUS IT IS NECESSARY FOR THIS PRIEST ALSO TO HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER

NOW IF HE WERE ON EARTH HE WOULD NOT BE A PRIEST AT ALL SINCE THERE ARE PRIESTS WHO OFFER GIFTS ACCORDING TO THE LAW

THEY SERVE A COPY AND SHADOW OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS

FOR WHEN MOSES WAS ABOUT TO ERECT THE TENT HE WAS INSTRUCTED BY GOD SAYING SEE THAT YOU MAKE EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN

 BUT AS IT IS CHRIST HAS OBTAINED A MINISTRY THAT IS AS MUCH MORE EXCELLENT THAN THE OLD AS THE COVENANT HE MEDIATES IS BETTER SINCE IT IS ENACTED ON BETTER PROMISES

FOR IF THAT FIRST COVENANT HAD BEEN FAULTLESS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO OCCASION TO LOOK FOR A SECOND

FOR HE FINDS FAULT WITH THEM WHEN HE SAYS BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING DECLARES THE LORD WHEN I WILL ESTABLISH A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH NOT LIKE THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT AND SO I SHOWED NO CONCERN FOR THEM DECLARES THE LORD

FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS DECLARES THE LORD I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS AND WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE

AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EACH ONE HIS NEIGHBOR AND EACH ONE HIS BROTHER SAYING 'KNOW THE LORD' FOR THEY SHALL ALL KNOW ME FROM THE LEAST OF THEM TO THE GREATEST

FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TOWARD THEIR INIQUITIES AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE

 IN SPEAKING OF A NEW COVENANT HE MAKES THE FIRST ONE OBSOLETE

AND WHAT IS BECOMING OBSOLETE AND GROWING OLD IS READY TO VANISH AWAY

NOW EVEN THE FIRST COVENANT HAD REGULATIONS FOR WORSHIP AND AN EARTHLY PLACE OF HOLINESS

FOR A TENT WAS PREPARED THE FIRST SECTION IN WHICH WERE THE LAMPSTAND AND THE TABLE AND THE BREAD OF THE PRESENCE

IT IS CALLED THE HOLY PLACE

BEHIND THE SECOND CURTAIN WAS A SECOND SECTION CALLED THE MOST HOLY PLACE HAVING THE GOLDEN ALTAR OF INCENSE AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT COVERED ON ALL SIDES WITH GOLD IN WHICH WAS A GOLDEN URN HOLDING THE MANNA AND AARON'S STAFF THAT BUDDED AND THE TABLETS OF THE COVENANT

ABOVE IT WERE THE CHERUBIM OF GLORY OVERSHADOWING THE MERCY SEAT

OF THESE THINGS WE CANNOT NOW SPEAK IN DETAIL

THESE PREPARATIONS HAVING THUS BEEN MADE THE PRIESTS GO REGULARLY INTO THE FIRST SECTION PERFORMING THEIR RITUAL DUTIES BUT INTO THE SECOND ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST GOES AND HE BUT ONCE A YEAR AND NOT WITHOUT TAKING BLOOD WHICH HE OFFERS FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE UNINTENTIONAL SINS OF THE PEOPLE

BY THIS THE HOLY SPIRIT INDICATES THAT THE WAY INTO THE HOLY PLACES IS NOT YET OPENED AS LONG AS THE FIRST SECTION IS STILL STANDING WHICH IS SYMBOLIC FOR THE PRESENT AGE

ACCORDING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT GIFTS AND SACRIFICES ARE OFFERED THAT CANNOT PERFECT THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORSHIPER BUT DEAL ONLY WITH FOOD AND DRINK AND VARIOUS WASHINGS REGULATIONS FOR THE BODY IMPOSED UNTIL THE TIME OF REFORMATION

BUT WHEN CHRIST APPEARED AS A HIGH PRIEST OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE COME THEN THROUGH THE GREATER AND MORE PERFECT TENT NOT MADE WITH HANDS THAT IS NOT OF THIS CREATION HE ENTERED ONCE FOR ALL INTO THE HOLY PLACES NOT BY MEANS OF THE BLOOD OF GOATS AND CALVES BUT BY MEANS OF HIS OWN BLOOD THUS SECURING AN ETERNAL REDEMPTION

FOR IF THE SPRINKLING OF DEFILED PERSONS WITH THE BLOOD OF GOATS AND BULLS AND WITH THE ASHES OF A HEIFER SANCTIFIES FOR THE PURIFICATION OF THE FLESH HOW MUCH MORE WILL THE BLOOD OF CHRIST WHO THROUGH THE ETERNAL SPIRIT OFFERED HIMSELF WITHOUT BLEMISH TO GOD PURIFY OUR CONSCIENCE FROM DEAD WORKS TO SERVE THE LIVING GOD

THEREFORE HE IS THE MEDIATOR OF A NEW COVENANT SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE CALLED MAY RECEIVE THE PROMISED ETERNAL INHERITANCE SINCE A DEATH HAS OCCURRED THAT REDEEMS THEM FROM THE TRANSGRESSIONS COMMITTED UNDER THE FIRST COVENANT

FOR WHERE A WILL IS INVOLVED THE DEATH OF THE ONE WHO MADE IT MUST BE ESTABLISHED

FOR A WILL TAKES EFFECT ONLY AT DEATH SINCE IT IS NOT IN FORCE AS LONG AS THE ONE WHO MADE IT IS ALIVE

THEREFORE NOT EVEN THE FIRST COVENANT WAS INAUGURATED WITHOUT BLOOD

FOR WHEN EVERY COMMANDMENT OF THE LAW HAD BEEN DECLARED BY MOSES TO ALL THE PEOPLE HE TOOK THE BLOOD OF CALVES AND GOATS WITH WATER AND SCARLET WOOL AND HYSSOP AND SPRINKLED BOTH THE BOOK ITSELF AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT THAT GOD COMMANDED FOR YOU

 AND IN THE SAME WAY HE SPRINKLED WITH THE BLOOD BOTH THE TENT AND ALL THE VESSELS USED IN WORSHIP

INDEED UNDER THE LAW ALMOST EVERYTHING IS PURIFIED WITH BLOOD AND WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS OF SINS

THUS IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE COPIES OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS TO BE PURIFIED WITH THESE RITES BUT THE HEAVENLY THINGS THEMSELVES WITH BETTER SACRIFICES THAN THESE

FOR CHRIST HAS ENTERED NOT INTO HOLY PLACES MADE WITH HANDS WHICH ARE COPIES OF THE TRUE THINGS BUT INTO HEAVEN ITSELF NOW TO APPEAR IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD ON OUR BEHALF

NOR WAS IT TO OFFER HIMSELF REPEATEDLY AS THE HIGH PRIEST ENTERS THE HOLY PLACES EVERY YEAR WITH BLOOD NOT HIS OWN FOR THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SUFFER REPEATEDLY SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD

BUT AS IT IS HE HAS APPEARED ONCE FOR ALL AT THE END OF THE AGES TO PUT AWAY SIN BY THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF

AND JUST AS IT IS APPOINTED FOR MAN TO DIE ONCE AND AFTER THAT COMES JUDGMENT SO CHRIST HAVING BEEN OFFERED ONCE TO BEAR THE SINS OF MANY WILL APPEAR A SECOND TIME NOT TO DEAL WITH SIN BUT TO SAVE THOSE WHO ARE EAGERLY WAITING FOR HIM

FOR SINCE THE LAW HAS BUT A SHADOW OF THE GOOD THINGS TO COME INSTEAD OF THE TRUE FORM OF THESE REALITIES IT CAN NEVER BY THE SAME SACRIFICES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY OFFERED EVERY YEAR MAKE PERFECT THOSE WHO DRAW NEAR

OTHERWISE WOULD THEY NOT HAVE CEASED TO BE OFFERED SINCE THE WORSHIPERS HAVING ONCE BEEN CLEANSED WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN

BUT IN THESE SACRIFICES THERE IS A REMINDER OF SIN EVERY YEAR

FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND GOATS TO TAKE AWAY SINS

CONSEQUENTLY WHEN CHRIST CAME INTO THE WORLD HE SAID SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED BUT A BODY HAVE YOU PREPARED FOR ME; IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND SIN OFFERINGS YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE

THEN I SAID 'BEHOLD I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL O GOD AS IT IS WRITTEN OF ME IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK

' WHEN HE SAID ABOVE YOU HAVE NEITHER DESIRED NOR TAKEN PLEASURE IN SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND BURNT OFFERINGS AND SIN OFFERINGS THESE ARE OFFERED ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEN HE ADDED BEHOLD I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL

 HE ABOLISHES THE FIRST IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE SECOND

AND BY THAT WILL WE HAVE BEEN SANCTIFIED THROUGH THE OFFERING OF THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST ONCE FOR ALL

AND EVERY PRIEST STANDS DAILY AT HIS SERVICE OFFERING REPEATEDLY THE SAME SACRIFICES WHICH CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY SINS

BUT WHEN CHRIST HAD OFFERED FOR ALL TIME A SINGLE SACRIFICE FOR SINS HE SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD WAITING FROM THAT TIME UNTIL HIS ENEMIES SHOULD BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET

FOR BY A SINGLE OFFERING HE HAS PERFECTED FOR ALL TIME THOSE WHO ARE BEING SANCTIFIED

AND THE HOLY SPIRIT ALSO BEARS WITNESS TO US; FOR AFTER SAYING THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS DECLARES THE LORD I WILL PUT MY LAWS ON THEIR HEARTS AND WRITE THEM ON THEIR MINDS THEN HE ADDS I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS NO MORE

 WHERE THERE IS FORGIVENESS OF THESE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY OFFERING FOR SIN

THEREFORE BROTHERS SINCE WE HAVE CONFIDENCE TO ENTER THE HOLY PLACES BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS BY THE NEW AND LIVING WAY THAT HE OPENED FOR US THROUGH THE CURTAIN THAT IS THROUGH HIS FLESH AND SINCE WE HAVE A GREAT PRIEST OVER THE HOUSE OF GOD LET US DRAW NEAR WITH A TRUE HEART IN FULL ASSURANCE OF FAITH WITH OUR HEARTS SPRINKLED CLEAN FROM AN EVIL CONSCIENCE AND OUR BODIES WASHED WITH PURE WATER

LET US HOLD FAST THE CONFESSION OF OUR HOPE WITHOUT WAVERING FOR HE WHO PROMISED IS FAITHFUL

AND LET US CONSIDER HOW TO STIR UP ONE ANOTHER TO LOVE AND GOOD WORKS NOT NEGLECTING TO MEET TOGETHER AS IS THE HABIT OF SOME BUT ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER AND ALL THE MORE AS YOU SEE THE DAY DRAWING NEAR

FOR IF WE GO ON SINNING DELIBERATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH THERE NO LONGER REMAINS A SACRIFICE FOR SINS BUT A FEARFUL EXPECTATION OF JUDGMENT AND A FURY OF FIRE THAT WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES

ANYONE WHO HAS SET ASIDE THE LAW OF MOSES DIES WITHOUT MERCY ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES

HOW MUCH WORSE PUNISHMENT DO YOU THINK WILL BE DESERVED BY THE ONE WHO HAS SPURNED THE SON OF GOD AND HAS PROFANED THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT BY WHICH HE WAS SANCTIFIED AND HAS OUTRAGED THE SPIRIT OF GRACE

FOR WE KNOW HIM WHO SAID VENGEANCE IS MINE; I WILL REPAY

 AND AGAIN THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE

 IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD

BUT RECALL THE FORMER DAYS WHEN AFTER YOU WERE ENLIGHTENED YOU ENDURED A HARD STRUGGLE WITH SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES BEING PUBLICLY EXPOSED TO REPROACH AND AFFLICTION AND SOMETIMES BEING PARTNERS WITH THOSE SO TREATED

FOR YOU HAD COMPASSION ON THOSE IN PRISON AND YOU JOYFULLY ACCEPTED THE PLUNDERING OF YOUR PROPERTY SINCE YOU KNEW THAT YOU YOURSELVES HAD A BETTER POSSESSION AND AN ABIDING ONE

THEREFORE DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR CONFIDENCE WHICH HAS A GREAT REWARD

FOR YOU HAVE NEED OF ENDURANCE SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THE WILL OF GOD YOU MAY RECEIVE WHAT IS PROMISED

FOR YET A LITTLE WHILE AND THE COMING ONE WILL COME AND WILL NOT DELAY; BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM

 BUT WE ARE NOT OF THOSE WHO SHRINK BACK AND ARE DESTROYED BUT OF THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH AND PRESERVE THEIR SOULS

NOW FAITH IS THE ASSURANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR THE CONVICTION OF THINGS NOT SEEN

FOR BY IT THE PEOPLE OF OLD RECEIVED THEIR COMMENDATION

BY FAITH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED BY THE WORD OF GOD SO THAT WHAT IS SEEN WAS NOT MADE OUT OF THINGS THAT ARE VISIBLE

BY FAITH ABEL OFFERED TO GOD A MORE ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE THAN CAIN THROUGH WHICH HE WAS COMMENDED AS RIGHTEOUS GOD COMMENDING HIM BY ACCEPTING HIS GIFTS

AND THROUGH HIS FAITH THOUGH HE DIED HE STILL SPEAKS

BY FAITH ENOCH WAS TAKEN UP SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEE DEATH AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD HAD TAKEN HIM

NOW BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN HE WAS COMMENDED AS HAVING PLEASED GOD

AND WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM FOR WHOEVER WOULD DRAW NEAR TO GOD MUST BELIEVE THAT HE EXISTS AND THAT HE REWARDS THOSE WHO SEEK HIM

BY FAITH NOAH BEING WARNED BY GOD CONCERNING EVENTS AS YET UNSEEN IN REVERENT FEAR CONSTRUCTED AN ARK FOR THE SAVING OF HIS HOUSEHOLD

BY THIS HE CONDEMNED THE WORLD AND BECAME AN HEIR OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT COMES BY FAITH

BY FAITH ABRAHAM OBEYED WHEN HE WAS CALLED TO GO OUT TO A PLACE THAT HE WAS TO RECEIVE AS AN INHERITANCE

AND HE WENT OUT NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING

BY FAITH HE WENT TO LIVE IN THE LAND OF PROMISE AS IN A FOREIGN LAND LIVING IN TENTS WITH ISAAC AND JACOB HEIRS WITH HIM OF THE SAME PROMISE

FOR HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CITY THAT HAS FOUNDATIONS WHOSE DESIGNER AND BUILDER IS GOD

BY FAITH SARAH HERSELF RECEIVED POWER TO CONCEIVE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS PAST THE AGE SINCE SHE CONSIDERED HIM FAITHFUL WHO HAD PROMISED

THEREFORE FROM ONE MAN AND HIM AS GOOD AS DEAD WERE BORN DESCENDANTS AS MANY AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND AS MANY AS THE INNUMERABLE GRAINS OF SAND BY THE SEASHORE

THESE ALL DIED IN FAITH NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE THINGS PROMISED BUT HAVING SEEN THEM AND GREETED THEM FROM AFAR AND HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND EXILES ON THE EARTH

FOR PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THUS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY ARE SEEKING A HOMELAND

IF THEY HAD BEEN THINKING OF THAT LAND FROM WHICH THEY HAD GONE OUT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN

BUT AS IT IS THEY DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY THAT IS A HEAVENLY ONE

THEREFORE GOD IS NOT ASHAMED TO BE CALLED THEIR GOD FOR HE HAS PREPARED FOR THEM A CITY

BY FAITH ABRAHAM WHEN HE WAS TESTED OFFERED UP ISAAC AND HE WHO HAD RECEIVED THE PROMISES WAS IN THE ACT OF OFFERING UP HIS ONLY SON OF WHOM IT WAS SAID THROUGH ISAAC SHALL YOUR OFFSPRING BE NAMED

 HE CONSIDERED THAT GOD WAS ABLE EVEN TO RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD FROM WHICH FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING HE DID RECEIVE HIM BACK

BY FAITH ISAAC INVOKED FUTURE BLESSINGS ON JACOB AND ESAU

BY FAITH JACOB WHEN DYING BLESSED EACH OF THE SONS OF JOSEPH BOWING IN WORSHIP OVER THE HEAD OF HIS STAFF

BY FAITH JOSEPH AT THE END OF HIS LIFE MADE MENTION OF THE EXODUS OF THE ISRAELITES AND GAVE DIRECTIONS CONCERNING HIS BONES

BY FAITH MOSES WHEN HE WAS BORN WAS HIDDEN FOR THREE MONTHS BY HIS PARENTS BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT THE CHILD WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THEY WERE NOT AFRAID OF THE KING'S EDICT

BY FAITH MOSES WHEN HE WAS GROWN UP REFUSED TO BE CALLED THE SON OF PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER CHOOSING RATHER TO BE MISTREATED WITH THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAN TO ENJOY THE FLEETING PLEASURES OF SIN

HE CONSIDERED THE REPROACH OF CHRIST GREATER WEALTH THAN THE TREASURES OF EGYPT FOR HE WAS LOOKING TO THE REWARD

BY FAITH HE LEFT EGYPT NOT BEING AFRAID OF THE ANGER OF THE KING FOR HE ENDURED AS SEEING HIM WHO IS INVISIBLE

BY FAITH HE KEPT THE PASSOVER AND SPRINKLED THE BLOOD SO THAT THE DESTROYER OF THE FIRSTBORN MIGHT NOT TOUCH THEM

BY FAITH THE PEOPLE CROSSED THE RED SEA AS IF ON DRY LAND BUT THE EGYPTIANS WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO DO THE SAME WERE DROWNED

BY FAITH THE WALLS OF JERICHO FELL DOWN AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ENCIRCLED FOR SEVEN DAYS

BY FAITH RAHAB THE PROSTITUTE DID NOT PERISH WITH THOSE WHO WERE DISOBEDIENT BECAUSE SHE HAD GIVEN A FRIENDLY WELCOME TO THE SPIES

AND WHAT MORE SHALL I SAY

FOR TIME WOULD FAIL ME TO TELL OF GIDEON BARAK SAMSON JEPHTHAH OF DAVID AND SAMUEL AND THE PROPHETS WHO THROUGH FAITH CONQUERED KINGDOMS ENFORCED JUSTICE OBTAINED PROMISES STOPPED THE MOUTHS OF LIONS QUENCHED THE POWER OF FIRE ESCAPED THE EDGE OF THE SWORD WERE MADE STRONG OUT OF WEAKNESS BECAME MIGHTY IN WAR PUT FOREIGN ARMIES TO FLIGHT

WOMEN RECEIVED BACK THEIR DEAD BY RESURRECTION

SOME WERE TORTURED REFUSING TO ACCEPT RELEASE SO THAT THEY MIGHT RISE AGAIN TO A BETTER LIFE

OTHERS SUFFERED MOCKING AND FLOGGING AND EVEN CHAINS AND IMPRISONMENT

THEY WERE STONED THEY WERE SAWN IN TWO THEY WERE KILLED WITH THE SWORD

THEY WENT ABOUT IN SKINS OF SHEEP AND GOATS DESTITUTE AFFLICTED MISTREATED OF WHOM THE WORLD WAS NOT WORTHYWANDERING ABOUT IN DESERTS AND MOUNTAINS AND IN DENS AND CAVES OF THE EARTH

AND ALL THESE THOUGH COMMENDED THROUGH THEIR FAITH DID NOT RECEIVE WHAT WAS PROMISED SINCE GOD HAD PROVIDED SOMETHING BETTER FOR US THAT APART FROM US THEY SHOULD NOT BE MADE PERFECT

THEREFORE SINCE WE ARE SURROUNDED BY SO GREAT A CLOUD OF WITNESSES LET US ALSO LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND SIN WHICH CLINGS SO CLOSELY AND LET US RUN WITH ENDURANCE THE RACE THAT IS SET BEFORE US LOOKING TO JESUS THE FOUNDER AND PERFECTER OF OUR FAITH WHO FOR THE JOY THAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM ENDURED THE CROSS DESPISING THE SHAME AND IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE THRONE OF GOD

CONSIDER HIM WHO ENDURED FROM SINNERS SUCH HOSTILITY AGAINST HIMSELF SO THAT YOU MAY NOT GROW WEARY OR FAINTHEARTED

IN YOUR STRUGGLE AGAINST SIN YOU HAVE NOT YET RESISTED TO THE POINT OF SHEDDING YOUR BLOOD

AND HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE EXHORTATION THAT ADDRESSES YOU AS SONS

MY SON DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD NOR BE WEARY WHEN REPROVED BY HIM

FOR THE LORD DISCIPLINES THE ONE HE LOVES AND CHASTISES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES

 IT IS FOR DISCIPLINE THAT YOU HAVE TO ENDURE

GOD IS TREATING YOU AS SONS

FOR WHAT SON IS THERE WHOM HIS FATHER DOES NOT DISCIPLINE

IF YOU ARE LEFT WITHOUT DISCIPLINE IN WHICH ALL HAVE PARTICIPATED THEN YOU ARE ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN AND NOT SONS

BESIDES THIS WE HAVE HAD EARTHLY FATHERS WHO DISCIPLINED US AND WE RESPECTED THEM

SHALL WE NOT MUCH MORE BE SUBJECT TO THE FATHER OF SPIRITS AND LIVE

FOR THEY DISCIPLINED US FOR A SHORT TIME AS IT SEEMED BEST TO THEM BUT HE DISCIPLINES US FOR OUR GOOD THAT WE MAY SHARE HIS HOLINESS

FOR THE MOMENT ALL DISCIPLINE SEEMS PAINFUL RATHER THAN PLEASANT BUT LATER IT YIELDS THE PEACEFUL FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY IT

THEREFORE LIFT YOUR DROOPING HANDS AND STRENGTHEN YOUR WEAK KNEES AND MAKE STRAIGHT PATHS FOR YOUR FEET SO THAT WHAT IS LAME MAY NOT BE PUT OUT OF JOINT BUT RATHER BE HEALED

STRIVE FOR PEACE WITH EVERYONE AND FOR THE HOLINESS WITHOUT WHICH NO ONE WILL SEE THE LORD

SEE TO IT THAT NO ONE FAILS TO OBTAIN THE GRACE OF GOD; THAT NO ROOT OF BITTERNESS SPRINGS UP AND CAUSES TROUBLE AND BY IT MANY BECOME DEFILED; THAT NO ONE IS SEXUALLY IMMORAL OR UNHOLY LIKE ESAU WHO SOLD HIS BIRTHRIGHT FOR A SINGLE MEAL

FOR YOU KNOW THAT AFTERWARD WHEN HE DESIRED TO INHERIT THE BLESSING HE WAS REJECTED FOR HE FOUND NO CHANCE TO REPENT THOUGH HE SOUGHT IT WITH TEARS

FOR YOU HAVE NOT COME TO WHAT MAY BE TOUCHED A BLAZING FIRE AND DARKNESS AND GLOOM AND A TEMPEST AND THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET AND A VOICE WHOSE WORDS MADE THE HEARERS BEG THAT NO FURTHER MESSAGES BE SPOKEN TO THEM

FOR THEY COULD NOT ENDURE THE ORDER THAT WAS GIVEN IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN IT SHALL BE STONED

 INDEED SO TERRIFYING WAS THE SIGHT THAT MOSES SAID I TREMBLE WITH FEAR

 BUT YOU HAVE COME TO MOUNT ZION AND TO THE CITY OF THE LIVING GOD THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM AND TO INNUMERABLE ANGELS IN FESTAL GATHERING AND TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE FIRSTBORN WHO ARE ENROLLED IN HEAVEN AND TO GOD THE JUDGE OF ALL AND TO THE SPIRITS OF THE RIGHTEOUS MADE PERFECT AND TO JESUS THE MEDIATOR OF A NEW COVENANT AND TO THE SPRINKLED BLOOD THAT SPEAKS A BETTER WORD THAN THE BLOOD OF ABEL

SEE THAT YOU DO NOT REFUSE HIM WHO IS SPEAKING

FOR IF THEY DID NOT ESCAPE WHEN THEY REFUSED HIM WHO WARNED THEM ON EARTH MUCH LESS WILL WE ESCAPE IF WE REJECT HIM WHO WARNS FROM HEAVEN

AT THAT TIME HIS VOICE SHOOK THE EARTH BUT NOW HE HAS PROMISED YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH BUT ALSO THE HEAVENS

 THIS PHRASE YET ONCE MORE INDICATES THE REMOVAL OF THINGS THAT ARE SHAKENTHAT IS THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADEIN ORDER THAT THE THINGS THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN MAY REMAIN

THEREFORE LET US BE GRATEFUL FOR RECEIVING A KINGDOM THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN AND THUS LET US OFFER TO GOD ACCEPTABLE WORSHIP WITH REVERENCE AND AWE FOR OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE

LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE

DO NOT NEGLECT TO SHOW HOSPITALITY TO STRANGERS FOR THEREBY SOME HAVE ENTERTAINED ANGELS UNAWARES

REMEMBER THOSE WHO ARE IN PRISON AS THOUGH IN PRISON WITH THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE MISTREATED SINCE YOU ALSO ARE IN THE BODY

LET MARRIAGE BE HELD IN HONOR AMONG ALL AND LET THE MARRIAGE BED BE UNDEFILED FOR GOD WILL JUDGE THE SEXUALLY IMMORAL AND ADULTEROUS

KEEP YOUR LIFE FREE FROM LOVE OF MONEY AND BE CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU HAVE FOR HE HAS SAID I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU

 SO WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THE LORD IS MY HELPER; I WILL NOT FEAR; WHAT CAN MAN DO TO ME

 REMEMBER YOUR LEADERS THOSE WHO SPOKE TO YOU THE WORD OF GOD

CONSIDER THE OUTCOME OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND IMITATE THEIR FAITH

JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND FOREVER

DO NOT BE LED AWAY BY DIVERSE AND STRANGE TEACHINGS FOR IT IS GOOD FOR THE HEART TO BE STRENGTHENED BY GRACE NOT BY FOODS WHICH HAVE NOT BENEFITED THOSE DEVOTED TO THEM

WE HAVE AN ALTAR FROM WHICH THOSE WHO SERVE THE TENT HAVE NO RIGHT TO EAT

FOR THE BODIES OF THOSE ANIMALS WHOSE BLOOD IS BROUGHT INTO THE HOLY PLACES BY THE HIGH PRIEST AS A SACRIFICE FOR SIN ARE BURNED OUTSIDE THE CAMP

SO JESUS ALSO SUFFERED OUTSIDE THE GATE IN ORDER TO SANCTIFY THE PEOPLE THROUGH HIS OWN BLOOD

THEREFORE LET US GO TO HIM OUTSIDE THE CAMP AND BEAR THE REPROACH HE ENDURED

FOR HERE WE HAVE NO LASTING CITY BUT WE SEEK THE CITY THAT IS TO COME

THROUGH HIM THEN LET US CONTINUALLY OFFER UP A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE TO GOD THAT IS THE FRUIT OF LIPS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE HIS NAME

DO NOT NEGLECT TO DO GOOD AND TO SHARE WHAT YOU HAVE FOR SUCH SACRIFICES ARE PLEASING TO GOD

EZEKIELIN THE THIRTIETH YEAR IN THE FOURTH MONTH ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH AS I WAS AMONG THE EXILES BY THE CHEBAR CANAL THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED AND I SAW VISIONS OF GOD

ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH IT WAS THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE EXILE OF KING JEHOIACHIN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO EZEKIEL THE PRIEST THE SON OF BUZI IN THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS BY THE CHEBAR CANAL AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS UPON HIM THERE

AS I LOOKED BEHOLD A STORMY WIND CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND A GREAT CLOUD WITH BRIGHTNESS AROUND IT AND FIRE FLASHING FORTH CONTINUALLY AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FIRE AS IT WERE GLEAMING METAL

AND FROM THE MIDST OF IT CAME THE LIKENESS OF FOUR LIVING CREATURES

AND THIS WAS THEIR APPEARANCE THEY HAD A HUMAN LIKENESS BUT EACH HAD FOUR FACES AND EACH OF THEM HAD FOUR WINGS

THEIR LEGS WERE STRAIGHT AND THE SOLES OF THEIR FEET WERE LIKE THE SOLE OF A CALF'S FOOT

AND THEY SPARKLED LIKE BURNISHED BRONZE

UNDER THEIR WINGS ON THEIR FOUR SIDES THEY HAD HUMAN HANDS

AND THE FOUR HAD THEIR FACES AND THEIR WINGS THUS THEIR WINGS TOUCHED ONE ANOTHER

EACH ONE OF THEM WENT STRAIGHT FORWARD WITHOUT TURNING AS THEY WENT

AS FOR THE LIKENESS OF THEIR FACES EACH HAD A HUMAN FACE

THE FOUR HAD THE FACE OF A LION ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE FOUR HAD THE FACE OF AN OX ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE FOUR HAD THE FACE OF AN EAGLE

SUCH WERE THEIR FACES

AND THEIR WINGS WERE SPREAD OUT ABOVE

EACH CREATURE HAD TWO WINGS EACH OF WHICH TOUCHED THE WING OF ANOTHER WHILE TWO COVERED THEIR BODIES

AND EACH WENT STRAIGHT FORWARD

WHEREVER THE SPIRIT WOULD GO THEY WENT WITHOUT TURNING AS THEY WENT

AS FOR THE LIKENESS OF THE LIVING CREATURES THEIR APPEARANCE WAS LIKE BURNING COALS OF FIRE LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF TORCHES MOVING TO AND FRO AMONG THE LIVING CREATURES

AND THE FIRE WAS BRIGHT AND OUT OF THE FIRE WENT FORTH LIGHTNING

AND THE LIVING CREATURES DARTED TO AND FRO LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING

NOW AS I LOOKED AT THE LIVING CREATURES I SAW A WHEEL ON THE EARTH BESIDE THE LIVING CREATURES ONE FOR EACH OF THE FOUR OF THEM

AS FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE WHEELS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION THEIR APPEARANCE WAS LIKE THE GLEAMING OF BERYL

AND THE FOUR HAD THE SAME LIKENESS THEIR APPEARANCE AND CONSTRUCTION BEING AS IT WERE A WHEEL WITHIN A WHEEL

WHEN THEY WENT THEY WENT IN ANY OF THEIR FOUR DIRECTIONS WITHOUT TURNING AS THEY WENT

AND THEIR RIMS WERE TALL AND AWESOME AND THE RIMS OF ALL FOUR WERE FULL OF EYES ALL AROUND

AND WHEN THE LIVING CREATURES WENT THE WHEELS WENT BESIDE THEM; AND WHEN THE LIVING CREATURES ROSE FROM THE EARTH THE WHEELS ROSE

WHEREVER THE SPIRIT WANTED TO GO THEY WENT AND THE WHEELS ROSE ALONG WITH THEM FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING CREATURES WAS IN THE WHEELS

WHEN THOSE WENT THESE WENT; AND WHEN THOSE STOOD THESE STOOD; AND WHEN THOSE ROSE FROM THE EARTH THE WHEELS ROSE ALONG WITH THEM FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING CREATURES WAS IN THE WHEELS

OVER THE HEADS OF THE LIVING CREATURES THERE WAS THE LIKENESS OF AN EXPANSE SHINING LIKE AWEINSPIRING CRYSTAL SPREAD OUT ABOVE THEIR HEADS

AND UNDER THE EXPANSE THEIR WINGS WERE STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT ONE TOWARD ANOTHER

AND EACH CREATURE HAD TWO WINGS COVERING ITS BODY

AND WHEN THEY WENT I HEARD THE SOUND OF THEIR WINGS LIKE THE SOUND OF MANY WATERS LIKE THE SOUND OF THE ALMIGHTY A SOUND OF TUMULT LIKE THE SOUND OF AN ARMY

WHEN THEY STOOD STILL THEY LET DOWN THEIR WINGS

AND THERE CAME A VOICE FROM ABOVE THE EXPANSE OVER THEIR HEADS

WHEN THEY STOOD STILL THEY LET DOWN THEIR WINGS

AND ABOVE THE EXPANSE OVER THEIR HEADS THERE WAS THE LIKENESS OF A THRONE IN APPEARANCE LIKE SAPPHIRE; AND SEATED ABOVE THE LIKENESS OF A THRONE WAS A LIKENESS WITH A HUMAN APPEARANCE

AND UPWARD FROM WHAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HIS WAIST I SAW AS IT WERE GLEAMING METAL LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF FIRE ENCLOSED ALL AROUND

AND DOWNWARD FROM WHAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HIS WAIST I SAW AS IT WERE THE APPEARANCE OF FIRE AND THERE WAS BRIGHTNESS AROUND HIM

LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOW THAT IS IN THE CLOUD ON THE DAY OF RAIN SO WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE BRIGHTNESS ALL AROUND

SUCH WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE LIKENESS OF THE GLORY OF THE LORD

AND WHEN I SAW IT I FELL ON MY FACE AND I HEARD THE VOICE OF ONE SPEAKING

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN STAND ON YOUR FEET AND I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU

 AND AS HE SPOKE TO ME THE SPIRIT ENTERED INTO ME AND SET ME ON MY FEET AND I HEARD HIM SPEAKING TO ME

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN I SEND YOU TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO NATIONS OF REBELS WHO HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

THEY AND THEIR FATHERS HAVE TRANSGRESSED AGAINST ME TO THIS VERY DAY

THE DESCENDANTS ALSO ARE IMPUDENT AND STUBBORN I SEND YOU TO THEM AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD

' AND WHETHER THEY HEAR OR REFUSE TO HEAR FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE THEY WILL KNOW THAT A PROPHET HAS BEEN AMONG THEM

AND YOU SON OF MAN BE NOT AFRAID OF THEM NOR BE AFRAID OF THEIR WORDS THOUGH BRIERS AND THORNS ARE WITH YOU AND YOU SIT ON SCORPIONS

BE NOT AFRAID OF THEIR WORDS NOR BE DISMAYED AT THEIR LOOKS FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

AND YOU SHALL SPEAK MY WORDS TO THEM WHETHER THEY HEAR OR REFUSE TO HEAR FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

BUT YOU SON OF MAN HEAR WHAT I SAY TO YOU

BE NOT REBELLIOUS LIKE THAT REBELLIOUS HOUSE; OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND EAT WHAT I GIVE YOU

 AND WHEN I LOOKED BEHOLD A HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT TO ME AND BEHOLD A SCROLL OF A BOOK WAS IN IT

AND HE SPREAD IT BEFORE ME

AND IT HAD WRITING ON THE FRONT AND ON THE BACK AND THERE WERE WRITTEN ON IT WORDS OF LAMENTATION AND MOURNING AND WOE

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN EAT WHATEVER YOU FIND HERE

EAT THIS SCROLL AND GO SPEAK TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

 SO I OPENED MY MOUTH AND HE GAVE ME THIS SCROLL TO EAT

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN FEED YOUR BELLY WITH THIS SCROLL THAT I GIVE YOU AND FILL YOUR STOMACH WITH IT

 THEN I ATE IT AND IT WAS IN MY MOUTH AS SWEET AS HONEY

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN GO TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND SPEAK WITH MY WORDS TO THEM

FOR YOU ARE NOT SENT TO A PEOPLE OF FOREIGN SPEECH AND A HARD LANGUAGE BUT TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL NOT TO MANY PEOPLES OF FOREIGN SPEECH AND A HARD LANGUAGE WHOSE WORDS YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND

SURELY IF I SENT YOU TO SUCH THEY WOULD LISTEN TO YOU

BUT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WILL NOT BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO YOU FOR THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME

BECAUSE ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL HAVE A HARD FOREHEAD AND A STUBBORN HEART

BEHOLD I HAVE MADE YOUR FACE AS HARD AS THEIR FACES AND YOUR FOREHEAD AS HARD AS THEIR FOREHEADS

LIKE EMERY HARDER THAN FLINT HAVE I MADE YOUR FOREHEAD

FEAR THEM NOT NOR BE DISMAYED AT THEIR LOOKS FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

 MOREOVER HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN ALL MY WORDS THAT I SHALL SPEAK TO YOU RECEIVE IN YOUR HEART AND HEAR WITH YOUR EARS

AND GO TO THE EXILES TO YOUR PEOPLE AND SPEAK TO THEM AND SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD' WHETHER THEY HEAR OR REFUSE TO HEAR

 THEN THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP AND I HEARD BEHIND ME THE VOICE OF A GREAT EARTHQUAKE BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF THE LORD FROM ITS PLACE

 IT WAS THE SOUND OF THE WINGS OF THE LIVING CREATURES AS THEY TOUCHED ONE ANOTHER AND THE SOUND OF THE WHEELS BESIDE THEM AND THE SOUND OF A GREAT EARTHQUAKE

THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP AND TOOK ME AWAY AND I WENT IN BITTERNESS IN THE HEAT OF MY SPIRIT THE HAND OF THE LORD BEING STRONG UPON ME

AND I CAME TO THE EXILES AT TELABIB WHO WERE DWELLING BY THE CHEBAR CANAL AND I SAT WHERE THEY WERE DWELLING

AND I SAT THERE OVERWHELMED AMONG THEM SEVEN DAYS

AND AT THE END OF SEVEN DAYS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN I HAVE MADE YOU A WATCHMAN FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

WHENEVER YOU HEAR A WORD FROM MY MOUTH YOU SHALL GIVE THEM WARNING FROM ME

IF I SAY TO THE WICKED 'YOU SHALL SURELY DIE' AND YOU GIVE HIM NO WARNING NOR SPEAK TO WARN THE WICKED FROM HIS WICKED WAY IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS LIFE THAT WICKED PERSON SHALL DIE FOR HIS INIQUITY BUT HIS BLOOD I WILL REQUIRE AT YOUR HAND

BUT IF YOU WARN THE WICKED AND HE DOES NOT TURN FROM HIS WICKEDNESS OR FROM HIS WICKED WAY HE SHALL DIE FOR HIS INIQUITY BUT YOU WILL HAVE DELIVERED YOUR SOUL

AGAIN IF A RIGHTEOUS PERSON TURNS FROM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND COMMITS INJUSTICE AND I LAY A STUMBLING BLOCK BEFORE HIM HE SHALL DIE

BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT WARNED HIM HE SHALL DIE FOR HIS SIN AND HIS RIGHTEOUS DEEDS THAT HE HAS DONE SHALL NOT BE REMEMBERED BUT HIS BLOOD I WILL REQUIRE AT YOUR HAND

BUT IF YOU WARN THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON NOT TO SIN AND HE DOES NOT SIN HE SHALL SURELY LIVE BECAUSE HE TOOK WARNING AND YOU WILL HAVE DELIVERED YOUR SOUL

 AND THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS UPON ME THERE

AND HE SAID TO ME ARISE GO OUT INTO THE VALLEY AND THERE I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU

 SO I AROSE AND WENT OUT INTO THE VALLEY AND BEHOLD THE GLORY OF THE LORD STOOD THERE LIKE THE GLORY THAT I HAD SEEN BY THE CHEBAR CANAL AND I FELL ON MY FACE

BUT THE SPIRIT ENTERED INTO ME AND SET ME ON MY FEET AND HE SPOKE WITH ME AND SAID TO ME GO SHUT YOURSELF WITHIN YOUR HOUSE

AND YOU O SON OF MAN BEHOLD CORDS WILL BE PLACED UPON YOU AND YOU SHALL BE BOUND WITH THEM SO THAT YOU CANNOT GO OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE

AND I WILL MAKE YOUR TONGUE CLING TO THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH SO THAT YOU SHALL BE MUTE AND UNABLE TO REPROVE THEM FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

BUT WHEN I SPEAK WITH YOU I WILL OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD

' HE WHO WILL HEAR LET HIM HEAR; AND HE WHO WILL REFUSE TO HEAR LET HIM REFUSE FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

AND YOU SON OF MAN TAKE A BRICK AND LAY IT BEFORE YOU AND ENGRAVE ON IT A CITY EVEN JERUSALEM

AND PUT SIEGEWORKS AGAINST IT AND BUILD A SIEGE WALL AGAINST IT AND CAST UP A MOUND AGAINST IT

SET CAMPS ALSO AGAINST IT AND PLANT BATTERING RAMS AGAINST IT ALL AROUND

AND YOU TAKE AN IRON GRIDDLE AND PLACE IT AS AN IRON WALL BETWEEN YOU AND THE CITY; AND SET YOUR FACE TOWARD IT AND LET IT BE IN A STATE OF SIEGE AND PRESS THE SIEGE AGAINST IT

THIS IS A SIGN FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THEN LIE ON YOUR LEFT SIDE AND PLACE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL UPON IT

FOR THE NUMBER OF THE DAYS THAT YOU LIE ON IT YOU SHALL BEAR THEIR PUNISHMENT

FOR I ASSIGN TO YOU A NUMBER OF DAYS  DAYS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF THE YEARS OF THEIR PUNISHMENT

SO LONG SHALL YOU BEAR THE PUNISHMENT OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AND WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED THESE YOU SHALL LIE DOWN A SECOND TIME BUT ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE AND BEAR THE PUNISHMENT OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH

FORTY DAYS I ASSIGN YOU A DAY FOR EACH YEAR

AND YOU SHALL SET YOUR FACE TOWARD THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM WITH YOUR ARM BARED AND YOU SHALL PROPHESY AGAINST THE CITY

AND BEHOLD I WILL PLACE CORDS UPON YOU SO THAT YOU CANNOT TURN FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER TILL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE DAYS OF YOUR SIEGE

AND YOU TAKE WHEAT AND BARLEY BEANS AND LENTILS MILLET AND EMMER AND PUT THEM INTO A SINGLE VESSEL AND MAKE YOUR BREAD FROM THEM

DURING THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT YOU LIE ON YOUR SIDE  DAYS YOU SHALL EAT IT

AND YOUR FOOD THAT YOU EAT SHALL BE BY WEIGHT TWENTY SHEKELS A DAY; FROM DAY TO DAY YOU SHALL EAT IT

AND WATER YOU SHALL DRINK BY MEASURE THE SIXTH PART OF A HIN; FROM DAY TO DAY YOU SHALL DRINK

AND YOU SHALL EAT IT AS A BARLEY CAKE BAKING IT IN THEIR SIGHT ON HUMAN DUNG

 AND THE LORD SAID THUS SHALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EAT THEIR BREAD UNCLEAN AMONG THE NATIONS WHERE I WILL DRIVE THEM

 THEN I SAID AH LORD GOD

BEHOLD I HAVE NEVER DEFILED MYSELF

FROM MY YOUTH UP TILL NOW I HAVE NEVER EATEN WHAT DIED OF ITSELF OR WAS TORN BY BEASTS NOR HAS TAINTED MEAT COME INTO MY MOUTH

 THEN HE SAID TO ME SEE I ASSIGN TO YOU COW'S DUNG INSTEAD OF HUMAN DUNG ON WHICH YOU MAY PREPARE YOUR BREAD

 MOREOVER HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN BEHOLD I WILL BREAK THE SUPPLY OF BREAD IN JERUSALEM

THEY SHALL EAT BREAD BY WEIGHT AND WITH ANXIETY AND THEY SHALL DRINK WATER BY MEASURE AND IN DISMAY

I WILL DO THIS THAT THEY MAY LACK BREAD AND WATER AND LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER IN DISMAY AND ROT AWAY BECAUSE OF THEIR PUNISHMENT

AND YOU O SON OF MAN TAKE A SHARP SWORD

USE IT AS A BARBER'S RAZOR AND PASS IT OVER YOUR HEAD AND YOUR BEARD

THEN TAKE BALANCES FOR WEIGHING AND DIVIDE THE HAIR

A THIRD PART YOU SHALL BURN IN THE FIRE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY WHEN THE DAYS OF THE SIEGE ARE COMPLETED

AND A THIRD PART YOU SHALL TAKE AND STRIKE WITH THE SWORD ALL AROUND THE CITY

AND A THIRD PART YOU SHALL SCATTER TO THE WIND AND I WILL UNSHEATHE THE SWORD AFTER THEM

AND YOU SHALL TAKE FROM THESE A SMALL NUMBER AND BIND THEM IN THE SKIRTS OF YOUR ROBE

AND OF THESE AGAIN YOU SHALL TAKE SOME AND CAST THEM INTO THE MIDST OF THE FIRE AND BURN THEM IN THE FIRE

FROM THERE A FIRE WILL COME OUT INTO ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THIS IS JERUSALEM

I HAVE SET HER IN THE CENTER OF THE NATIONS WITH COUNTRIES ALL AROUND HER

AND SHE HAS REBELLED AGAINST MY RULES BY DOING WICKEDNESS MORE THAN THE NATIONS AND AGAINST MY STATUTES MORE THAN THE COUNTRIES ALL AROUND HER; FOR THEY HAVE REJECTED MY RULES AND HAVE NOT WALKED IN MY STATUTES

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU ARE MORE TURBULENT THAN THE NATIONS THAT ARE ALL AROUND YOU AND HAVE NOT WALKED IN MY STATUTES OR OBEYED MY RULES AND HAVE NOT EVEN ACTED ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THE NATIONS THAT ARE ALL AROUND YOU THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I EVEN I AM AGAINST YOU

AND I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS IN YOUR MIDST IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS

AND BECAUSE OF ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS I WILL DO WITH YOU WHAT I HAVE NEVER YET DONE AND THE LIKE OF WHICH I WILL NEVER DO AGAIN

THEREFORE FATHERS SHALL EAT THEIR SONS IN YOUR MIDST AND SONS SHALL EAT THEIR FATHERS

AND I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS ON YOU AND ANY OF YOU WHO SURVIVE I WILL SCATTER TO ALL THE WINDS

THEREFORE AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD SURELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE DEFILED MY SANCTUARY WITH ALL YOUR DETESTABLE THINGS AND WITH ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS THEREFORE I WILL WITHDRAW

MY EYE WILL NOT SPARE AND I WILL HAVE NO PITY

A THIRD PART OF YOU SHALL DIE OF PESTILENCE AND BE CONSUMED WITH FAMINE IN YOUR MIDST; A THIRD PART SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD ALL AROUND YOU; AND A THIRD PART I WILL SCATTER TO ALL THE WINDS AND WILL UNSHEATHE THE SWORD AFTER THEM

THUS SHALL MY ANGER SPEND ITSELF AND I WILL VENT MY FURY UPON THEM AND SATISFY MYSELF

AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORDTHAT I HAVE SPOKEN IN MY JEALOUSYWHEN I SPEND MY FURY UPON THEM

MOREOVER I WILL MAKE YOU A DESOLATION AND AN OBJECT OF REPROACH AMONG THE NATIONS ALL AROUND YOU AND IN THE SIGHT OF ALL WHO PASS BY

YOU SHALL BE A REPROACH AND A TAUNT A WARNING AND A HORROR TO THE NATIONS ALL AROUND YOU WHEN I EXECUTE JUDGMENTS ON YOU IN ANGER AND FURY AND WITH FURIOUS REBUKESI AM THE LORD I HAVE SPOKEN WHEN I SEND AGAINST YOU THE DEADLY ARROWS OF FAMINE ARROWS FOR DESTRUCTION WHICH I WILL SEND TO DESTROY YOU AND WHEN I BRING MORE AND MORE FAMINE UPON YOU AND BREAK YOUR SUPPLY OF BREAD

I WILL SEND FAMINE AND WILD BEASTS AGAINST YOU AND THEY WILL ROB YOU OF YOUR CHILDREN

PESTILENCE AND BLOOD SHALL PASS THROUGH YOU AND I WILL BRING THE SWORD UPON YOU

I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SET YOUR FACE TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL AND PROPHESY AGAINST THEM AND SAY YOU MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD GOD

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE HILLS TO THE RAVINES AND THE VALLEYS BEHOLD I EVEN I WILL BRING A SWORD UPON YOU AND I WILL DESTROY YOUR HIGH PLACES

YOUR ALTARS SHALL BECOME DESOLATE AND YOUR INCENSE ALTARS SHALL BE BROKEN AND I WILL CAST DOWN YOUR SLAIN BEFORE YOUR IDOLS

AND I WILL LAY THE DEAD BODIES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BEFORE THEIR IDOLS AND I WILL SCATTER YOUR BONES AROUND YOUR ALTARS

WHEREVER YOU DWELL THE CITIES SHALL BE WASTE AND THE HIGH PLACES RUINED SO THAT YOUR ALTARS WILL BE WASTE AND RUINED YOUR IDOLS BROKEN AND DESTROYED YOUR INCENSE ALTARS CUT DOWN AND YOUR WORKS WIPED OUT

AND THE SLAIN SHALL FALL IN YOUR MIDST AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

YET I WILL LEAVE SOME OF YOU ALIVE

WHEN YOU HAVE AMONG THE NATIONS SOME WHO ESCAPE THE SWORD AND WHEN YOU ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE COUNTRIES THEN THOSE OF YOU WHO ESCAPE WILL REMEMBER ME AMONG THE NATIONS WHERE THEY ARE CARRIED CAPTIVE HOW I HAVE BEEN BROKEN OVER THEIR WHORING HEART THAT HAS DEPARTED FROM ME AND OVER THEIR EYES THAT GO WHORING AFTER THEIR IDOLS

AND THEY WILL BE LOATHSOME IN THEIR OWN SIGHT FOR THE EVILS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED FOR ALL THEIR ABOMINATIONS

AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

I HAVE NOT SAID IN VAIN THAT I WOULD DO THIS EVIL TO THEM

 THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD CLAP YOUR HANDS AND STAMP YOUR FOOT AND SAY ALAS BECAUSE OF ALL THE EVIL ABOMINATIONS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL FOR THEY SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD BY FAMINE AND BY PESTILENCE

HE WHO IS FAR OFF SHALL DIE OF PESTILENCE AND HE WHO IS NEAR SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD AND HE WHO IS LEFT AND IS PRESERVED SHALL DIE OF FAMINE

THUS I WILL SPEND MY FURY UPON THEM

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN THEIR SLAIN LIE AMONG THEIR IDOLS AROUND THEIR ALTARS ON EVERY HIGH HILL ON ALL THE MOUNTAINTOPS UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE AND UNDER EVERY LEAFY OAK WHEREVER THEY OFFERED PLEASING AROMA TO ALL THEIR IDOLS

AND I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST THEM AND MAKE THE LAND DESOLATE AND WASTE IN ALL THEIR DWELLING PLACES FROM THE WILDERNESS TO RIBLAH

THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME AND YOU O SON OF MAN THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO THE LAND OF ISRAEL AN END

THE END HAS COME UPON THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE LAND

NOW THE END IS UPON YOU AND I WILL SEND MY ANGER UPON YOU; I WILL JUDGE YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR WAYS AND I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS

AND MY EYE WILL NOT SPARE YOU NOR WILL I HAVE PITY BUT I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR WAYS WHILE YOUR ABOMINATIONS ARE IN YOUR MIDST

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD DISASTER AFTER DISASTER

BEHOLD IT COMES

AN END HAS COME; THE END HAS COME; IT HAS AWAKENED AGAINST YOU

BEHOLD IT COMES

YOUR DOOM HAS COME TO YOU O INHABITANT OF THE LAND

THE TIME HAS COME; THE DAY IS NEAR A DAY OF TUMULT AND NOT OF JOYFUL SHOUTING ON THE MOUNTAINS

NOW I WILL SOON POUR OUT MY WRATH UPON YOU AND SPEND MY ANGER AGAINST YOU AND JUDGE YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR WAYS AND I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS

AND MY EYE WILL NOT SPARE NOR WILL I HAVE PITY

I WILL PUNISH YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR WAYS WHILE YOUR ABOMINATIONS ARE IN YOUR MIDST

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHO STRIKES

BEHOLD THE DAY

BEHOLD IT COMES

YOUR DOOM HAS COME; THE ROD HAS BLOSSOMED; PRIDE HAS BUDDED

VIOLENCE HAS GROWN UP INTO A ROD OF WICKEDNESS

NONE OF THEM SHALL REMAIN NOR THEIR ABUNDANCE NOR THEIR WEALTH; NEITHER SHALL THERE BE PREEMINENCE AMONG THEM

THE TIME HAS COME; THE DAY HAS ARRIVED

LET NOT THE BUYER REJOICE NOR THE SELLER MOURN FOR WRATH IS UPON ALL THEIR MULTITUDE

FOR THE SELLER SHALL NOT RETURN TO WHAT HE HAS SOLD WHILE THEY LIVE

FOR THE VISION CONCERNS ALL THEIR MULTITUDE; IT SHALL NOT TURN BACK; AND BECAUSE OF HIS INIQUITY NONE CAN MAINTAIN HIS LIFE

THEY HAVE BLOWN THE TRUMPET AND MADE EVERYTHING READY BUT NONE GOES TO BATTLE FOR MY WRATH IS UPON ALL THEIR MULTITUDE

THE SWORD IS WITHOUT; PESTILENCE AND FAMINE ARE WITHIN

HE WHO IS IN THE FIELD DIES BY THE SWORD AND HIM WHO IS IN THE CITY FAMINE AND PESTILENCE DEVOUR

AND IF ANY SURVIVORS ESCAPE THEY WILL BE ON THE MOUNTAINS LIKE DOVES OF THE VALLEYS ALL OF THEM MOANING EACH ONE OVER HIS INIQUITY

ALL HANDS ARE FEEBLE AND ALL KNEES TURN TO WATER

THEY PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND HORROR COVERS THEM

SHAME IS ON ALL FACES AND BALDNESS ON ALL THEIR HEADS

THEY CAST THEIR SILVER INTO THE STREETS AND THEIR GOLD IS LIKE AN UNCLEAN THING

THEIR SILVER AND GOLD ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THEM IN THE DAY OF THE WRATH OF THE LORD

THEY CANNOT SATISFY THEIR HUNGER OR FILL THEIR STOMACHS WITH IT

FOR IT WAS THE STUMBLING BLOCK OF THEIR INIQUITY

HIS BEAUTIFUL ORNAMENT THEY USED FOR PRIDE AND THEY MADE THEIR ABOMINABLE IMAGES AND THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS OF IT

THEREFORE I MAKE IT AN UNCLEAN THING TO THEM

AND I WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGNERS FOR PREY AND TO THE WICKED OF THE EARTH FOR SPOIL AND THEY SHALL PROFANE IT

I WILL TURN MY FACE FROM THEM AND THEY SHALL PROFANE MY TREASURED PLACE

ROBBERS SHALL ENTER AND PROFANE IT

FORGE A CHAIN

FOR THE LAND IS FULL OF BLOODY CRIMES AND THE CITY IS FULL OF VIOLENCE

I WILL BRING THE WORST OF THE NATIONS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR HOUSES

I WILL PUT AN END TO THE PRIDE OF THE STRONG AND THEIR HOLY PLACES SHALL BE PROFANED

WHEN ANGUISH COMES THEY WILL SEEK PEACE BUT THERE SHALL BE NONE

DISASTER COMES UPON DISASTER; RUMOR FOLLOWS RUMOR

THEY SEEK A VISION FROM THE PROPHET WHILE THE LAW PERISHES FROM THE PRIEST AND COUNSEL FROM THE ELDERS

THE KING MOURNS THE PRINCE IS WRAPPED IN DESPAIR AND THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND ARE PARALYZED BY TERROR

ACCORDING TO THEIR WAY I WILL DO TO THEM AND ACCORDING TO THEIR JUDGMENTS I WILL JUDGE THEM AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

IN THE SIXTH YEAR IN THE SIXTH MONTH ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH AS I SAT IN MY HOUSE WITH THE ELDERS OF JUDAH SITTING BEFORE ME THE HAND OF THE LORD GOD FELL UPON ME THERE

THEN I LOOKED AND BEHOLD A FORM THAT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN

BELOW WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS WAIST WAS FIRE AND ABOVE HIS WAIST WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF BRIGHTNESS LIKE GLEAMING METAL

HE PUT OUT THE FORM OF A HAND AND TOOK ME BY A LOCK OF MY HEAD AND THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN AND BROUGHT ME IN VISIONS OF GOD TO JERUSALEM TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATEWAY OF THE INNER COURT THAT FACES NORTH WHERE WAS THE SEAT OF THE IMAGE OF JEALOUSY WHICH PROVOKES TO JEALOUSY

AND BEHOLD THE GLORY OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL WAS THERE LIKE THE VISION THAT I SAW IN THE VALLEY

THEN HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN LIFT UP YOUR EYES NOW TOWARD THE NORTH

 SO I LIFTED UP MY EYES TOWARD THE NORTH AND BEHOLD NORTH OF THE ALTAR GATE IN THE ENTRANCE WAS THIS IMAGE OF JEALOUSY

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING THE GREAT ABOMINATIONS THAT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE COMMITTING HERE TO DRIVE ME FAR FROM MY SANCTUARY

BUT YOU WILL SEE STILL GREATER ABOMINATIONS

 AND HE BROUGHT ME TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT AND WHEN I LOOKED BEHOLD THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE WALL

THEN HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN DIG IN THE WALL

 SO I DUG IN THE WALL AND BEHOLD THERE WAS AN ENTRANCE

AND HE SAID TO ME GO IN AND SEE THE VILE ABOMINATIONS THAT THEY ARE COMMITTING HERE

 SO I WENT IN AND SAW

AND THERE ENGRAVED ON THE WALL ALL AROUND WAS EVERY FORM OF CREEPING THINGS AND LOATHSOME BEASTS AND ALL THE IDOLS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AND BEFORE THEM STOOD SEVENTY MEN OF THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH JAAZANIAH THE SON OF SHAPHAN STANDING AMONG THEM

EACH HAD HIS CENSER IN HIS HAND AND THE SMOKE OF THE CLOUD OF INCENSE WENT UP

THEN HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE DOING IN THE DARK EACH IN HIS ROOM OF PICTURES

FOR THEY SAY 'THE LORD DOES NOT SEE US THE LORD HAS FORSAKEN THE LAND

' HE SAID ALSO TO ME YOU WILL SEE STILL GREATER ABOMINATIONS THAT THEY COMMIT

 THEN HE BROUGHT ME TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE NORTH GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND BEHOLD THERE SAT WOMEN WEEPING FOR TAMMUZ

THEN HE SAID TO ME HAVE YOU SEEN THIS O SON OF MAN

YOU WILL SEE STILL GREATER ABOMINATIONS THAN THESE

 AND HE BROUGHT ME INTO THE INNER COURT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND BEHOLD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD BETWEEN THE PORCH AND THE ALTAR WERE ABOUT TWENTYFIVE MEN WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AND THEIR FACES TOWARD THE EAST WORSHIPING THE SUN TOWARD THE EAST

THEN HE SAID TO ME HAVE YOU SEEN THIS O SON OF MAN

IS IT TOO LIGHT A THING FOR THE HOUSE OF JUDAH TO COMMIT THE ABOMINATIONS THAT THEY COMMIT HERE THAT THEY SHOULD FILL THE LAND WITH VIOLENCE AND PROVOKE ME STILL FURTHER TO ANGER

BEHOLD THEY PUT THE BRANCH TO THEIR NOSE

THEREFORE I WILL ACT IN WRATH

MY EYE WILL NOT SPARE NOR WILL I HAVE PITY

AND THOUGH THEY CRY IN MY EARS WITH A LOUD VOICE I WILL NOT HEAR THEM

THEN HE CRIED IN MY EARS WITH A LOUD VOICE SAYING BRING NEAR THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE CITY EACH WITH HIS DESTROYING WEAPON IN HIS HAND

 AND BEHOLD SIX MEN CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE UPPER GATE WHICH FACES NORTH EACH WITH HIS WEAPON FOR SLAUGHTER IN HIS HAND AND WITH THEM WAS A MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WITH A WRITING CASE AT HIS WAIST

AND THEY WENT IN AND STOOD BESIDE THE BRONZE ALTAR

NOW THE GLORY OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAD GONE UP FROM THE CHERUB ON WHICH IT RESTED TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE HOUSE

AND HE CALLED TO THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WHO HAD THE WRITING CASE AT HIS WAIST

AND THE LORD SAID TO HIM PASS THROUGH THE CITY THROUGH JERUSALEM AND PUT A MARK ON THE FOREHEADS OF THE MEN WHO SIGH AND GROAN OVER ALL THE ABOMINATIONS THAT ARE COMMITTED IN IT

 AND TO THE OTHERS HE SAID IN MY HEARING PASS THROUGH THE CITY AFTER HIM AND STRIKE

YOUR EYE SHALL NOT SPARE AND YOU SHALL SHOW NO PITY

KILL OLD MEN OUTRIGHT YOUNG MEN AND MAIDENS LITTLE CHILDREN AND WOMEN BUT TOUCH NO ONE ON WHOM IS THE MARK

AND BEGIN AT MY SANCTUARY

 SO THEY BEGAN WITH THE ELDERS WHO WERE BEFORE THE HOUSE

THEN HE SAID TO THEM DEFILE THE HOUSE AND FILL THE COURTS WITH THE SLAIN

GO OUT

 SO THEY WENT OUT AND STRUCK IN THE CITY

AND WHILE THEY WERE STRIKING AND I WAS LEFT ALONE I FELL UPON MY FACE AND CRIED AH LORD GOD

WILL YOU DESTROY ALL THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL IN THE OUTPOURING OF YOUR WRATH ON JERUSALEM

 THEN HE SAID TO ME THE GUILT OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH IS EXCEEDINGLY GREAT

THE LAND IS FULL OF BLOOD AND THE CITY FULL OF INJUSTICE

FOR THEY SAY 'THE LORD HAS FORSAKEN THE LAND AND THE LORD DOES NOT SEE

' AS FOR ME MY EYE WILL NOT SPARE NOR WILL I HAVE PITY; I WILL BRING THEIR DEEDS UPON THEIR HEADS

 AND BEHOLD THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WITH THE WRITING CASE AT HIS WAIST BROUGHT BACK WORD SAYING I HAVE DONE AS YOU COMMANDED ME

THEN I LOOKED AND BEHOLD ON THE EXPANSE THAT WAS OVER THE HEADS OF THE CHERUBIM THERE APPEARED ABOVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE A SAPPHIRE IN APPEARANCE LIKE A THRONE

AND HE SAID TO THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN GO IN AMONG THE WHIRLING WHEELS UNDERNEATH THE CHERUBIM

FILL YOUR HANDS WITH BURNING COALS FROM BETWEEN THE CHERUBIM AND SCATTER THEM OVER THE CITY

AND HE WENT IN BEFORE MY EYES

NOW THE CHERUBIM WERE STANDING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHEN THE MAN WENT IN AND A CLOUD FILLED THE INNER COURT

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD WENT UP FROM THE CHERUB TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH THE CLOUD AND THE COURT WAS FILLED WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE GLORY OF THE LORD

AND THE SOUND OF THE WINGS OF THE CHERUBIM WAS HEARD AS FAR AS THE OUTER COURT LIKE THE VOICE OF GOD ALMIGHTY WHEN HE SPEAKS

AND WHEN HE COMMANDED THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN TAKE FIRE FROM BETWEEN THE WHIRLING WHEELS FROM BETWEEN THE CHERUBIM HE WENT IN AND STOOD BESIDE A WHEEL

AND A CHERUB STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FROM BETWEEN THE CHERUBIM TO THE FIRE THAT WAS BETWEEN THE CHERUBIM AND TOOK SOME OF IT AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE MAN CLOTHED IN LINEN WHO TOOK IT AND WENT OUT

THE CHERUBIM APPEARED TO HAVE THE FORM OF A HUMAN HAND UNDER THEIR WINGS

AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD THERE WERE FOUR WHEELS BESIDE THE CHERUBIM ONE BESIDE EACH CHERUB AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WHEELS WAS LIKE SPARKLING BERYL

AND AS FOR THEIR APPEARANCE THE FOUR HAD THE SAME LIKENESS AS IF A WHEEL WERE WITHIN A WHEEL

WHEN THEY WENT THEY WENT IN ANY OF THEIR FOUR DIRECTIONS WITHOUT TURNING AS THEY WENT BUT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION THE FRONT WHEEL FACED THE OTHERS FOLLOWED WITHOUT TURNING AS THEY WENT

AND THEIR WHOLE BODY THEIR RIMS AND THEIR SPOKES THEIR WINGS AND THE WHEELS WERE FULL OF EYES ALL AROUNDTHE WHEELS THAT THE FOUR OF THEM HAD

AS FOR THE WHEELS THEY WERE CALLED IN MY HEARING THE WHIRLING WHEELS

 AND EVERY ONE HAD FOUR FACES THE FIRST FACE WAS THE FACE OF THE CHERUB AND THE SECOND FACE WAS A HUMAN FACE AND THE THIRD THE FACE OF A LION AND THE FOURTH THE FACE OF AN EAGLE

AND THE CHERUBIM MOUNTED UP

THESE WERE THE LIVING CREATURES THAT I SAW BY THE CHEBAR CANAL

AND WHEN THE CHERUBIM WENT THE WHEELS WENT BESIDE THEM

AND WHEN THE CHERUBIM LIFTED UP THEIR WINGS TO MOUNT UP FROM THE EARTH THE WHEELS DID NOT TURN FROM BESIDE THEM

WHEN THEY STOOD STILL THESE STOOD STILL AND WHEN THEY MOUNTED UP THESE MOUNTED UP WITH THEM FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING CREATURES WAS IN THEM

THEN THE GLORY OF THE LORD WENT OUT FROM THE THRESHOLD OF THE HOUSE AND STOOD OVER THE CHERUBIM

AND THE CHERUBIM LIFTED UP THEIR WINGS AND MOUNTED UP FROM THE EARTH BEFORE MY EYES AS THEY WENT OUT WITH THE WHEELS BESIDE THEM

AND THEY STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE EAST GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE GLORY OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL WAS OVER THEM

THESE WERE THE LIVING CREATURES THAT I SAW UNDERNEATH THE GOD OF ISRAEL BY THE CHEBAR CANAL; AND I KNEW THAT THEY WERE CHERUBIM

EACH HAD FOUR FACES AND EACH FOUR WINGS AND UNDERNEATH THEIR WINGS THE LIKENESS OF HUMAN HANDS

AND AS FOR THE LIKENESS OF THEIR FACES THEY WERE THE SAME FACES WHOSE APPEARANCE I HAD SEEN BY THE CHEBAR CANAL

EACH ONE OF THEM WENT STRAIGHT FORWARD

THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP AND BROUGHT ME TO THE EAST GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WHICH FACES EAST

AND BEHOLD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATEWAY THERE WERE TWENTYFIVE MEN

AND I SAW AMONG THEM JAAZANIAH THE SON OF AZZUR AND PELATIAH THE SON OF BENAIAH PRINCES OF THE PEOPLE

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN THESE ARE THE MEN WHO DEVISE INIQUITY AND WHO GIVE WICKED COUNSEL IN THIS CITY; WHO SAY 'THE TIME IS NOT NEAR TO BUILD HOUSES

THIS CITY IS THE CAULDRON AND WE ARE THE MEAT

' THEREFORE PROPHESY AGAINST THEM PROPHESY O SON OF MAN

 AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD FELL UPON ME AND HE SAID TO ME SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD SO YOU THINK O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

FOR I KNOW THE THINGS THAT COME INTO YOUR MIND

YOU HAVE MULTIPLIED YOUR SLAIN IN THIS CITY AND HAVE FILLED ITS STREETS WITH THE SLAIN

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD YOUR SLAIN WHOM YOU HAVE LAID IN THE MIDST OF IT THEY ARE THE MEAT AND THIS CITY IS THE CAULDRON BUT YOU SHALL BE BROUGHT OUT OF THE MIDST OF IT

YOU HAVE FEARED THE SWORD AND I WILL BRING THE SWORD UPON YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND I WILL BRING YOU OUT OF THE MIDST OF IT AND GIVE YOU INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGNERS AND EXECUTE JUDGMENTS UPON YOU

YOU SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD

I WILL JUDGE YOU AT THE BORDER OF ISRAEL AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THIS CITY SHALL NOT BE YOUR CAULDRON NOR SHALL YOU BE THE MEAT IN THE MIDST OF IT

I WILL JUDGE YOU AT THE BORDER OF ISRAEL AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

FOR YOU HAVE NOT WALKED IN MY STATUTES NOR OBEYED MY RULES BUT HAVE ACTED ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THE NATIONS THAT ARE AROUND YOU

 AND IT CAME TO PASS WHILE I WAS PROPHESYING THAT PELATIAH THE SON OF BENAIAH DIED

THEN I FELL DOWN ON MY FACE AND CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE AND SAID AH LORD GOD

WILL YOU MAKE A FULL END OF THE REMNANT OF ISRAEL

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN YOUR BROTHERS EVEN YOUR BROTHERS YOUR KINSMEN THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ALL OF THEM ARE THOSE OF WHOM THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM HAVE SAID 'GO FAR FROM THE LORD; TO US THIS LAND IS GIVEN FOR A POSSESSION

' THEREFORE SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THOUGH I REMOVED THEM FAR OFF AMONG THE NATIONS AND THOUGH I SCATTERED THEM AMONG THE COUNTRIES YET I HAVE BEEN A SANCTUARY TO THEM FOR A WHILE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE GONE

' THEREFORE SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I WILL GATHER YOU FROM THE PEOPLES AND ASSEMBLE YOU OUT OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN SCATTERED AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE LAND OF ISRAEL

' AND WHEN THEY COME THERE THEY WILL REMOVE FROM IT ALL ITS DETESTABLE THINGS AND ALL ITS ABOMINATIONS

AND I WILL GIVE THEM ONE HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT I WILL PUT WITHIN THEM

I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM THEIR FLESH AND GIVE THEM A HEART OF FLESH THAT THEY MAY WALK IN MY STATUTES AND KEEP MY RULES AND OBEY THEM

AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD

BUT AS FOR THOSE WHOSE HEART GOES AFTER THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS AND THEIR ABOMINATIONS I WILL BRING THEIR DEEDS UPON THEIR OWN HEADS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 THEN THE CHERUBIM LIFTED UP THEIR WINGS WITH THE WHEELS BESIDE THEM AND THE GLORY OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL WAS OVER THEM

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD WENT UP FROM THE MIDST OF THE CITY AND STOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN THAT IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CITY

AND THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP AND BROUGHT ME IN THE VISION BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD INTO CHALDEA TO THE EXILES

THEN THE VISION THAT I HAD SEEN WENT UP FROM ME

AND I TOLD THE EXILES ALL THE THINGS THAT THE LORD HAD SHOWN ME

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN YOU DWELL IN THE MIDST OF A REBELLIOUS HOUSE WHO HAVE EYES TO SEE BUT SEE NOT WHO HAVE EARS TO HEAR BUT HEAR NOT FOR THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN PREPARE FOR YOURSELF AN EXILE'S BAGGAGE AND GO INTO EXILE BY DAY IN THEIR SIGHT

YOU SHALL GO LIKE AN EXILE FROM YOUR PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE IN THEIR SIGHT

PERHAPS THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH THEY ARE A REBELLIOUS HOUSE

YOU SHALL BRING OUT YOUR BAGGAGE BY DAY IN THEIR SIGHT AS BAGGAGE FOR EXILE AND YOU SHALL GO OUT YOURSELF AT EVENING IN THEIR SIGHT AS THOSE DO WHO MUST GO INTO EXILE

IN THEIR SIGHT DIG THROUGH THE WALL AND BRING YOUR BAGGAGE OUT THROUGH IT

IN THEIR SIGHT YOU SHALL LIFT THE BAGGAGE UPON YOUR SHOULDER AND CARRY IT OUT AT DUSK

YOU SHALL COVER YOUR FACE THAT YOU MAY NOT SEE THE LAND FOR I HAVE MADE YOU A SIGN FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

 AND I DID AS I WAS COMMANDED

I BROUGHT OUT MY BAGGAGE BY DAY AS BAGGAGE FOR EXILE AND IN THE EVENING I DUG THROUGH THE WALL WITH MY OWN HANDS

I BROUGHT OUT MY BAGGAGE AT DUSK CARRYING IT ON MY SHOULDER IN THEIR SIGHT

IN THE MORNING THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN HAS NOT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THE REBELLIOUS HOUSE SAID TO YOU 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING

' SAY TO THEM 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THIS ORACLE CONCERNS THE PRINCE IN JERUSALEM AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WHO ARE IN IT

' SAY 'I AM A SIGN FOR YOU AS I HAVE DONE SO SHALL IT BE DONE TO THEM

THEY SHALL GO INTO EXILE INTO CAPTIVITY

' AND THE PRINCE WHO IS AMONG THEM SHALL LIFT HIS BAGGAGE UPON HIS SHOULDER AT DUSK AND SHALL GO OUT

THEY SHALL DIG THROUGH THE WALL TO BRING HIM OUT THROUGH IT

HE SHALL COVER HIS FACE THAT HE MAY NOT SEE THE LAND WITH HIS EYES

AND I WILL SPREAD MY NET OVER HIM AND HE SHALL BE TAKEN IN MY SNARE

AND I WILL BRING HIM TO BABYLON THE LAND OF THE CHALDEANS YET HE SHALL NOT SEE IT AND HE SHALL DIE THERE

AND I WILL SCATTER TOWARD EVERY WIND ALL WHO ARE AROUND HIM HIS HELPERS AND ALL HIS TROOPS AND I WILL UNSHEATHE THE SWORD AFTER THEM

AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I DISPERSE THEM AMONG THE NATIONS AND SCATTER THEM AMONG THE COUNTRIES

BUT I WILL LET A FEW OF THEM ESCAPE FROM THE SWORD FROM FAMINE AND PESTILENCE THAT THEY MAY DECLARE ALL THEIR ABOMINATIONS AMONG THE NATIONS WHERE THEY GO AND MAY KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN EAT YOUR BREAD WITH QUAKING AND DRINK WATER WITH TREMBLING AND WITH ANXIETY

AND SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD CONCERNING THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL THEY SHALL EAT THEIR BREAD WITH ANXIETY AND DRINK WATER IN DISMAY

IN THIS WAY HER LAND WILL BE STRIPPED OF ALL IT CONTAINS ON ACCOUNT OF THE VIOLENCE OF ALL THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT

AND THE INHABITED CITIES SHALL BE LAID WASTE AND THE LAND SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION; AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN WHAT IS THIS PROVERB THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THE LAND OF ISRAEL SAYING 'THE DAYS GROW LONG AND EVERY VISION COMES TO NOTHING'

TELL THEM THEREFORE 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS PROVERB AND THEY SHALL NO MORE USE IT AS A PROVERB IN ISRAEL

' BUT SAY TO THEM THE DAYS ARE NEAR AND THE FULFILLMENT OF EVERY VISION

FOR THERE SHALL BE NO MORE ANY FALSE VISION OR FLATTERING DIVINATION WITHIN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

FOR I AM THE LORD; I WILL SPEAK THE WORD THAT I WILL SPEAK AND IT WILL BE PERFORMED

IT WILL NO LONGER BE DELAYED BUT IN YOUR DAYS O REBELLIOUS HOUSE I WILL SPEAK THE WORD AND PERFORM IT DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN BEHOLD THEY OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SAY 'THE VISION THAT HE SEES IS FOR MANY DAYS FROM NOW AND HE PROPHESIES OF TIMES FAR OFF

' THEREFORE SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD NONE OF MY WORDS WILL BE DELAYED ANY LONGER BUT THE WORD THAT I SPEAK WILL BE PERFORMED DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN PROPHESY AGAINST THE PROPHETS OF ISRAEL WHO ARE PROPHESYING AND SAY TO THOSE WHO PROPHESY FROM THEIR OWN HEARTS 'HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

' THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WOE TO THE FOOLISH PROPHETS WHO FOLLOW THEIR OWN SPIRIT AND HAVE SEEN NOTHING

YOUR PROPHETS HAVE BEEN LIKE JACKALS AMONG RUINS O ISRAEL

YOU HAVE NOT GONE UP INTO THE BREACHES OR BUILT UP A WALL FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THAT IT MIGHT STAND IN BATTLE IN THE DAY OF THE LORD

THEY HAVE SEEN FALSE VISIONS AND LYING DIVINATIONS

THEY SAY 'DECLARES THE LORD' WHEN THE LORD HAS NOT SENT THEM AND YET THEY EXPECT HIM TO FULFILL THEIR WORD

HAVE YOU NOT SEEN A FALSE VISION AND UTTERED A LYING DIVINATION WHENEVER YOU HAVE SAID 'DECLARES THE LORD' ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT SPOKEN

 THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE UTTERED FALSEHOOD AND SEEN LYING VISIONS THEREFORE BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD

MY HAND WILL BE AGAINST THE PROPHETS WHO SEE FALSE VISIONS AND WHO GIVE LYING DIVINATIONS

THEY SHALL NOT BE IN THE COUNCIL OF MY PEOPLE NOR BE ENROLLED IN THE REGISTER OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL NOR SHALL THEY ENTER THE LAND OF ISRAEL

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD GOD

PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MISLED MY PEOPLE SAYING 'PEACE' WHEN THERE IS NO PEACE AND BECAUSE WHEN THE PEOPLE BUILD A WALL THESE PROPHETS SMEAR IT WITH WHITEWASH SAY TO THOSE WHO SMEAR IT WITH WHITEWASH THAT IT SHALL FALL

THERE WILL BE A DELUGE OF RAIN AND YOU O GREAT HAILSTONES WILL FALL AND A STORMY WIND BREAK OUT

AND WHEN THE WALL FALLS WILL IT NOT BE SAID TO YOU 'WHERE IS THE COATING WITH WHICH YOU SMEARED IT

' THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I WILL MAKE A STORMY WIND BREAK OUT IN MY WRATH AND THERE SHALL BE A DELUGE OF RAIN IN MY ANGER AND GREAT HAILSTONES IN WRATH TO MAKE A FULL END

AND I WILL BREAK DOWN THE WALL THAT YOU HAVE SMEARED WITH WHITEWASH AND BRING IT DOWN TO THE GROUND SO THAT ITS FOUNDATION WILL BE LAID BARE

WHEN IT FALLS YOU SHALL PERISH IN THE MIDST OF IT AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THUS WILL I SPEND MY WRATH UPON THE WALL AND UPON THOSE WHO HAVE SMEARED IT WITH WHITEWASH AND I WILL SAY TO YOU THE WALL IS NO MORE NOR THOSE WHO SMEARED IT THE PROPHETS OF ISRAEL WHO PROPHESIED CONCERNING JERUSALEM AND SAW VISIONS OF PEACE FOR HER WHEN THERE WAS NO PEACE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND YOU SON OF MAN SET YOUR FACE AGAINST THE DAUGHTERS OF YOUR PEOPLE WHO PROPHESY OUT OF THEIR OWN MINDS

PROPHESY AGAINST THEM AND SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WOE TO THE WOMEN WHO SEW MAGIC BANDS UPON ALL WRISTS AND MAKE VEILS FOR THE HEADS OF PERSONS OF EVERY STATURE IN THE HUNT FOR SOULS

WILL YOU HUNT DOWN SOULS BELONGING TO MY PEOPLE AND KEEP YOUR OWN SOULS ALIVE

YOU HAVE PROFANED ME AMONG MY PEOPLE FOR HANDFULS OF BARLEY AND FOR PIECES OF BREAD PUTTING TO DEATH SOULS WHO SHOULD NOT DIE AND KEEPING ALIVE SOULS WHO SHOULD NOT LIVE BY YOUR LYING TO MY PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO LIES

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOUR MAGIC BANDS WITH WHICH YOU HUNT THE SOULS LIKE BIRDS AND I WILL TEAR THEM FROM YOUR ARMS AND I WILL LET THE SOULS WHOM YOU HUNT GO FREE THE SOULS LIKE BIRDS

YOUR VEILS ALSO I WILL TEAR OFF AND DELIVER MY PEOPLE OUT OF YOUR HAND AND THEY SHALL BE NO MORE IN YOUR HAND AS PREY AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

BECAUSE YOU HAVE DISHEARTENED THE RIGHTEOUS FALSELY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT GRIEVED HIM AND YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED THE WICKED THAT HE SHOULD NOT TURN FROM HIS EVIL WAY TO SAVE HIS LIFE THEREFORE YOU SHALL NO MORE SEE FALSE VISIONS NOR PRACTICE DIVINATION

I WILL DELIVER MY PEOPLE OUT OF YOUR HAND

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THEN CERTAIN OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME TO ME AND SAT BEFORE ME

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN THESE MEN HAVE TAKEN THEIR IDOLS INTO THEIR HEARTS AND SET THE STUMBLING BLOCK OF THEIR INIQUITY BEFORE THEIR FACES

SHOULD I INDEED LET MYSELF BE CONSULTED BY THEM

THEREFORE SPEAK TO THEM AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD ANY ONE OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WHO TAKES HIS IDOLS INTO HIS HEART AND SETS THE STUMBLING BLOCK OF HIS INIQUITY BEFORE HIS FACE AND YET COMES TO THE PROPHET I THE LORD WILL ANSWER HIM AS HE COMES WITH THE MULTITUDE OF HIS IDOLS THAT I MAY LAY HOLD OF THE HEARTS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WHO ARE ALL ESTRANGED FROM ME THROUGH THEIR IDOLS

THEREFORE SAY TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD REPENT AND TURN AWAY FROM YOUR IDOLS AND TURN AWAY YOUR FACES FROM ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS

FOR ANY ONE OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL OR OF THE STRANGERS WHO SOJOURN IN ISRAEL WHO SEPARATES HIMSELF FROM ME TAKING HIS IDOLS INTO HIS HEART AND PUTTING THE STUMBLING BLOCK OF HIS INIQUITY BEFORE HIS FACE AND YET COMES TO A PROPHET TO CONSULT ME THROUGH HIM I THE LORD WILL ANSWER HIM MYSELF

AND I WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST THAT MAN; I WILL MAKE HIM A SIGN AND A BYWORD AND CUT HIM OFF FROM THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

AND IF THE PROPHET IS DECEIVED AND SPEAKS A WORD I THE LORD HAVE DECEIVED THAT PROPHET AND I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST HIM AND WILL DESTROY HIM FROM THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND THEY SHALL BEAR THEIR PUNISHMENTTHE PUNISHMENT OF THE PROPHET AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE INQUIRER SHALL BE ALIKE THAT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL MAY NO MORE GO ASTRAY FROM ME NOR DEFILE THEMSELVES ANYMORE WITH ALL THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS BUT THAT THEY MAY BE MY PEOPLE AND I MAY BE THEIR GOD DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN WHEN A LAND SINS AGAINST ME BY ACTING FAITHLESSLY AND I STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST IT AND BREAK ITS SUPPLY OF BREAD AND SEND FAMINE UPON IT AND CUT OFF FROM IT MAN AND BEAST EVEN IF THESE THREE MEN NOAH DANIEL AND JOB WERE IN IT THEY WOULD DELIVER BUT THEIR OWN LIVES BY THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

IF I CAUSE WILD BEASTS TO PASS THROUGH THE LAND AND THEY RAVAGE IT AND IT BE MADE DESOLATE SO THAT NO ONE MAY PASS THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE BEASTS EVEN IF THESE THREE MEN WERE IN IT AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD THEY WOULD DELIVER NEITHER SONS NOR DAUGHTERS

THEY ALONE WOULD BE DELIVERED BUT THE LAND WOULD BE DESOLATE

OR IF I BRING A SWORD UPON THAT LAND AND SAY LET A SWORD PASS THROUGH THE LAND AND I CUT OFF FROM IT MAN AND BEAST THOUGH THESE THREE MEN WERE IN IT AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD THEY WOULD DELIVER NEITHER SONS NOR DAUGHTERS BUT THEY ALONE WOULD BE DELIVERED

OR IF I SEND A PESTILENCE INTO THAT LAND AND POUR OUT MY WRATH UPON IT WITH BLOOD TO CUT OFF FROM IT MAN AND BEAST EVEN IF NOAH DANIEL AND JOB WERE IN IT AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD THEY WOULD DELIVER NEITHER SON NOR DAUGHTER

THEY WOULD DELIVER BUT THEIR OWN LIVES BY THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD HOW MUCH MORE WHEN I SEND UPON JERUSALEM MY FOUR DISASTROUS ACTS OF JUDGMENT SWORD FAMINE WILD BEASTS AND PESTILENCE TO CUT OFF FROM IT MAN AND BEAST

BUT BEHOLD SOME SURVIVORS WILL BE LEFT IN IT SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO WILL BE BROUGHT OUT; BEHOLD WHEN THEY COME OUT TO YOU AND YOU SEE THEIR WAYS AND THEIR DEEDS YOU WILL BE CONSOLED FOR THE DISASTER THAT I HAVE BROUGHT UPON JERUSALEM FOR ALL THAT I HAVE BROUGHT UPON IT

THEY WILL CONSOLE YOU WHEN YOU SEE THEIR WAYS AND THEIR DEEDS AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT DONE WITHOUT CAUSE ALL THAT I HAVE DONE IN IT DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN HOW DOES THE WOOD OF THE VINE SURPASS ANY WOOD THE VINE BRANCH THAT IS AMONG THE TREES OF THE FOREST

IS WOOD TAKEN FROM IT TO MAKE ANYTHING

DO PEOPLE TAKE A PEG FROM IT TO HANG ANY VESSEL ON IT

BEHOLD IT IS GIVEN TO THE FIRE FOR FUEL

WHEN THE FIRE HAS CONSUMED BOTH ENDS OF IT AND THE MIDDLE OF IT IS CHARRED IS IT USEFUL FOR ANYTHING

BEHOLD WHEN IT WAS WHOLE IT WAS USED FOR NOTHING

HOW MUCH LESS WHEN THE FIRE HAS CONSUMED IT AND IT IS CHARRED CAN IT EVER BE USED FOR ANYTHING

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD LIKE THE WOOD OF THE VINE AMONG THE TREES OF THE FOREST WHICH I HAVE GIVEN TO THE FIRE FOR FUEL SO HAVE I GIVEN UP THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM

AND I WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST THEM

THOUGH THEY ESCAPE FROM THE FIRE THE FIRE SHALL YET CONSUME THEM AND YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I SET MY FACE AGAINST THEM

AND I WILL MAKE THE LAND DESOLATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACTED FAITHLESSLY DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AGAIN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN MAKE KNOWN TO JERUSALEM HER ABOMINATIONS AND SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO JERUSALEM YOUR ORIGIN AND YOUR BIRTH ARE OF THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES; YOUR FATHER WAS AN AMORITE AND YOUR MOTHER A HITTITE

AND AS FOR YOUR BIRTH ON THE DAY YOU WERE BORN YOUR CORD WAS NOT CUT NOR WERE YOU WASHED WITH WATER TO CLEANSE YOU NOR RUBBED WITH SALT NOR WRAPPED IN SWADDLING CLOTHS

NO EYE PITIED YOU TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS TO YOU OUT OF COMPASSION FOR YOU BUT YOU WERE CAST OUT ON THE OPEN FIELD FOR YOU WERE ABHORRED ON THE DAY THAT YOU WERE BORN

AND WHEN I PASSED BY YOU AND SAW YOU WALLOWING IN YOUR BLOOD I SAID TO YOU IN YOUR BLOOD 'LIVE

' I SAID TO YOU IN YOUR BLOOD 'LIVE

' I MADE YOU FLOURISH LIKE A PLANT OF THE FIELD

AND YOU GREW UP AND BECAME TALL AND ARRIVED AT FULL ADORNMENT

YOUR BREASTS WERE FORMED AND YOUR HAIR HAD GROWN; YET YOU WERE NAKED AND BARE

WHEN I PASSED BY YOU AGAIN AND SAW YOU BEHOLD YOU WERE AT THE AGE FOR LOVE AND I SPREAD THE CORNER OF MY GARMENT OVER YOU AND COVERED YOUR NAKEDNESS; I MADE MY VOW TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO A COVENANT WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD AND YOU BECAME MINE

THEN I BATHED YOU WITH WATER AND WASHED OFF YOUR BLOOD FROM YOU AND ANOINTED YOU WITH OIL

I CLOTHED YOU ALSO WITH EMBROIDERED CLOTH AND SHOD YOU WITH FINE LEATHER

I WRAPPED YOU IN FINE LINEN AND COVERED YOU WITH SILK

AND I ADORNED YOU WITH ORNAMENTS AND PUT BRACELETS ON YOUR WRISTS AND A CHAIN ON YOUR NECK

AND I PUT A RING ON YOUR NOSE AND EARRINGS IN YOUR EARS AND A BEAUTIFUL CROWN ON YOUR HEAD

THUS YOU WERE ADORNED WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND YOUR CLOTHING WAS OF FINE LINEN AND SILK AND EMBROIDERED CLOTH

YOU ATE FINE FLOUR AND HONEY AND OIL

YOU GREW EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND ADVANCED TO ROYALTY

AND YOUR RENOWN WENT FORTH AMONG THE NATIONS BECAUSE OF YOUR BEAUTY FOR IT WAS PERFECT THROUGH THE SPLENDOR THAT I HAD BESTOWED ON YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD

BUT YOU TRUSTED IN YOUR BEAUTY AND PLAYED THE WHORE BECAUSE OF YOUR RENOWN AND LAVISHED YOUR WHORINGS ON ANY PASSERBY; YOUR BEAUTY BECAME HIS

YOU TOOK SOME OF YOUR GARMENTS AND MADE FOR YOURSELF COLORFUL SHRINES AND ON THEM PLAYED THE WHORE

THE LIKE HAS NEVER BEEN NOR EVER SHALL BE

YOU ALSO TOOK YOUR BEAUTIFUL JEWELS OF MY GOLD AND OF MY SILVER WHICH I HAD GIVEN YOU AND MADE FOR YOURSELF IMAGES OF MEN AND WITH THEM PLAYED THE WHORE

AND YOU TOOK YOUR EMBROIDERED GARMENTS TO COVER THEM AND SET MY OIL AND MY INCENSE BEFORE THEM

ALSO MY BREAD THAT I GAVE YOUI FED YOU WITH FINE FLOUR AND OIL AND HONEYYOU SET BEFORE THEM FOR A PLEASING AROMA; AND SO IT WAS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND YOU TOOK YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS WHOM YOU HAD BORNE TO ME AND THESE YOU SACRIFICED TO THEM TO BE DEVOURED

WERE YOUR WHORINGS SO SMALL A MATTER THAT YOU SLAUGHTERED MY CHILDREN AND DELIVERED THEM UP AS AN OFFERING BY FIRE TO THEM

AND IN ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS AND YOUR WHORINGS YOU DID NOT REMEMBER THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH WHEN YOU WERE NAKED AND BARE WALLOWING IN YOUR BLOOD

AND AFTER ALL YOUR WICKEDNESS WOE WOE TO YOU

DECLARES THE LORD GOD YOU BUILT YOURSELF A VAULTED CHAMBER AND MADE YOURSELF A LOFTY PLACE IN EVERY SQUARE

AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET YOU BUILT YOUR LOFTY PLACE AND MADE YOUR BEAUTY AN ABOMINATION OFFERING YOURSELF TO ANY PASSERBY AND MULTIPLYING YOUR WHORING

YOU ALSO PLAYED THE WHORE WITH THE EGYPTIANS YOUR LUSTFUL NEIGHBORS MULTIPLYING YOUR WHORING TO PROVOKE ME TO ANGER

BEHOLD THEREFORE I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND AGAINST YOU AND DIMINISHED YOUR ALLOTTED PORTION AND DELIVERED YOU TO THE GREED OF YOUR ENEMIES THE DAUGHTERS OF THE PHILISTINES WHO WERE ASHAMED OF YOUR LEWD BEHAVIOR

YOU PLAYED THE WHORE ALSO WITH THE ASSYRIANS BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED; YES YOU PLAYED THE WHORE WITH THEM AND STILL YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED

YOU MULTIPLIED YOUR WHORING ALSO WITH THE TRADING LAND OF CHALDEA AND EVEN WITH THIS YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED

HOW LOVESICK IS YOUR HEART DECLARES THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU DID ALL THESE THINGS THE DEEDS OF A BRAZEN PROSTITUTE BUILDING YOUR VAULTED CHAMBER AT THE HEAD OF EVERY STREET AND MAKING YOUR LOFTY PLACE IN EVERY SQUARE

YET YOU WERE NOT LIKE A PROSTITUTE BECAUSE YOU SCORNED PAYMENT

ADULTEROUS WIFE WHO RECEIVES STRANGERS INSTEAD OF HER HUSBAND

MEN GIVE GIFTS TO ALL PROSTITUTES BUT YOU GAVE YOUR GIFTS TO ALL YOUR LOVERS BRIBING THEM TO COME TO YOU FROM EVERY SIDE WITH YOUR WHORINGS

SO YOU WERE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WOMEN IN YOUR WHORINGS

NO ONE SOLICITED YOU TO PLAY THE WHORE AND YOU GAVE PAYMENT WHILE NO PAYMENT WAS GIVEN TO YOU; THEREFORE YOU WERE DIFFERENT

THEREFORE O PROSTITUTE HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOUR LUST WAS POURED OUT AND YOUR NAKEDNESS UNCOVERED IN YOUR WHORINGS WITH YOUR LOVERS AND WITH ALL YOUR ABOMINABLE IDOLS AND BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD OF YOUR CHILDREN THAT YOU GAVE TO THEM THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL GATHER ALL YOUR LOVERS WITH WHOM YOU TOOK PLEASURE ALL THOSE YOU LOVED AND ALL THOSE YOU HATED

I WILL GATHER THEM AGAINST YOU FROM EVERY SIDE AND WILL UNCOVER YOUR NAKEDNESS TO THEM THAT THEY MAY SEE ALL YOUR NAKEDNESS

AND I WILL JUDGE YOU AS WOMEN WHO COMMIT ADULTERY AND SHED BLOOD ARE JUDGED AND BRING UPON YOU THE BLOOD OF WRATH AND JEALOUSY

AND I WILL GIVE YOU INTO THEIR HANDS AND THEY SHALL THROW DOWN YOUR VAULTED CHAMBER AND BREAK DOWN YOUR LOFTY PLACES

THEY SHALL STRIP YOU OF YOUR CLOTHES AND TAKE YOUR BEAUTIFUL JEWELS AND LEAVE YOU NAKED AND BARE

THEY SHALL BRING UP A CROWD AGAINST YOU AND THEY SHALL STONE YOU AND CUT YOU TO PIECES WITH THEIR SWORDS

AND THEY SHALL BURN YOUR HOUSES AND EXECUTE JUDGMENTS UPON YOU IN THE SIGHT OF MANY WOMEN

I WILL MAKE YOU STOP PLAYING THE WHORE AND YOU SHALL ALSO GIVE PAYMENT NO MORE

SO WILL I SATISFY MY WRATH ON YOU AND MY JEALOUSY SHALL DEPART FROM YOU

I WILL BE CALM AND WILL NO MORE BE ANGRY

BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT REMEMBERED THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH BUT HAVE ENRAGED ME WITH ALL THESE THINGS THEREFORE BEHOLD I HAVE RETURNED YOUR DEEDS UPON YOUR HEAD DECLARES THE LORD GOD

HAVE YOU NOT COMMITTED LEWDNESS IN ADDITION TO ALL YOUR ABOMINATIONS

BEHOLD EVERYONE WHO USES PROVERBS WILL USE THIS PROVERB ABOUT YOU 'LIKE MOTHER LIKE DAUGHTER

' YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR MOTHER WHO LOATHED HER HUSBAND AND HER CHILDREN; AND YOU ARE THE SISTER OF YOUR SISTERS WHO LOATHED THEIR HUSBANDS AND THEIR CHILDREN

YOUR MOTHER WAS A HITTITE AND YOUR FATHER AN AMORITE

AND YOUR ELDER SISTER IS SAMARIA WHO LIVED WITH HER DAUGHTERS TO THE NORTH OF YOU; AND YOUR YOUNGER SISTER WHO LIVED TO THE SOUTH OF YOU IS SODOM WITH HER DAUGHTERS

NOT ONLY DID YOU WALK IN THEIR WAYS AND DO ACCORDING TO THEIR ABOMINATIONS; WITHIN A VERY LITTLE TIME YOU WERE MORE CORRUPT THAN THEY IN ALL YOUR WAYS

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD YOUR SISTER SODOM AND HER DAUGHTERS HAVE NOT DONE AS YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE

BEHOLD THIS WAS THE GUILT OF YOUR SISTER SODOM SHE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD PRIDE EXCESS OF FOOD AND PROSPEROUS EASE BUT DID NOT AID THE POOR AND NEEDY

THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND DID AN ABOMINATION BEFORE ME

SO I REMOVED THEM WHEN I SAW IT

SAMARIA HAS NOT COMMITTED HALF YOUR SINS

YOU HAVE COMMITTED MORE ABOMINATIONS THAN THEY AND HAVE MADE YOUR SISTERS APPEAR RIGHTEOUS BY ALL THE ABOMINATIONS THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED

BEAR YOUR DISGRACE YOU ALSO FOR YOU HAVE INTERVENED ON BEHALF OF YOUR SISTERS

BECAUSE OF YOUR SINS IN WHICH YOU ACTED MORE ABOMINABLY THAN THEY THEY ARE MORE IN THE RIGHT THAN YOU

SO BE ASHAMED YOU ALSO AND BEAR YOUR DISGRACE FOR YOU HAVE MADE YOUR SISTERS APPEAR RIGHTEOUS

I WILL RESTORE THEIR FORTUNES BOTH THE FORTUNES OF SODOM AND HER DAUGHTERS AND THE FORTUNES OF SAMARIA AND HER DAUGHTERS AND I WILL RESTORE YOUR OWN FORTUNES IN THEIR MIDST THAT YOU MAY BEAR YOUR DISGRACE AND BE ASHAMED OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE BECOMING A CONSOLATION TO THEM

AS FOR YOUR SISTERS SODOM AND HER DAUGHTERS SHALL RETURN TO THEIR FORMER STATE AND SAMARIA AND HER DAUGHTERS SHALL RETURN TO THEIR FORMER STATE AND YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL RETURN TO YOUR FORMER STATE

WAS NOT YOUR SISTER SODOM A BYWORD IN YOUR MOUTH IN THE DAY OF YOUR PRIDE BEFORE YOUR WICKEDNESS WAS UNCOVERED

NOW YOU HAVE BECOME AN OBJECT OF REPROACH FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF SYRIA AND ALL THOSE AROUND HER AND FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF THE PHILISTINES THOSE ALL AROUND WHO DESPISE YOU

YOU BEAR THE PENALTY OF YOUR LEWDNESS AND YOUR ABOMINATIONS DECLARES THE LORD

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I WILL DEAL WITH YOU AS YOU HAVE DONE YOU WHO HAVE DESPISED THE OATH IN BREAKING THE COVENANT YET I WILL REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH YOU IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH AND I WILL ESTABLISH FOR YOU AN EVERLASTING COVENANT

THEN YOU WILL REMEMBER YOUR WAYS AND BE ASHAMED WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR SISTERS BOTH YOUR ELDER AND YOUR YOUNGER AND I GIVE THEM TO YOU AS DAUGHTERS BUT NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THE COVENANT WITH YOU

I WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND BE CONFOUNDED AND NEVER OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAIN BECAUSE OF YOUR SHAME WHEN I ATONE FOR YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN PROPOUND A RIDDLE AND SPEAK A PARABLE TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL; SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD A GREAT EAGLE WITH GREAT WINGS AND LONG PINIONS RICH IN PLUMAGE OF MANY COLORS CAME TO LEBANON AND TOOK THE TOP OF THE CEDAR

HE BROKE OFF THE TOPMOST OF ITS YOUNG TWIGS AND CARRIED IT TO A LAND OF TRADE AND SET IT IN A CITY OF MERCHANTS

THEN HE TOOK OF THE SEED OF THE LAND AND PLANTED IT IN FERTILE SOIL

HE PLACED IT BESIDE ABUNDANT WATERS

HE SET IT LIKE A WILLOW TWIG AND IT SPROUTED AND BECAME A LOW SPREADING VINE AND ITS BRANCHES TURNED TOWARD HIM AND ITS ROOTS REMAINED WHERE IT STOOD

SO IT BECAME A VINE AND PRODUCED BRANCHES AND PUT OUT BOUGHS

AND THERE WAS ANOTHER GREAT EAGLE WITH GREAT WINGS AND MUCH PLUMAGE AND BEHOLD THIS VINE BENT ITS ROOTS TOWARD HIM AND SHOT FORTH ITS BRANCHES TOWARD HIM FROM THE BED WHERE IT WAS PLANTED THAT HE MIGHT WATER IT

IT HAD BEEN PLANTED ON GOOD SOIL BY ABUNDANT WATERS THAT IT MIGHT PRODUCE BRANCHES AND BEAR FRUIT AND BECOME A NOBLE VINE

SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WILL IT THRIVE

WILL HE NOT PULL UP ITS ROOTS AND CUT OFF ITS FRUIT SO THAT IT WITHERS SO THAT ALL ITS FRESH SPROUTING LEAVES WITHER

IT WILL NOT TAKE A STRONG ARM OR MANY PEOPLE TO PULL IT FROM ITS ROOTS

BEHOLD IT IS PLANTED; WILL IT THRIVE

WILL IT NOT UTTERLY WITHER WHEN THE EAST WIND STRIKES ITWITHER AWAY ON THE BED WHERE IT SPROUTED

 THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAY NOW TO THE REBELLIOUS HOUSE DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN

TELL THEM BEHOLD THE KING OF BABYLON CAME TO JERUSALEM AND TOOK HER KING AND HER PRINCES AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIM TO BABYLON

AND HE TOOK ONE OF THE ROYAL OFFSPRING AND MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM PUTTING HIM UNDER OATH THE CHIEF MEN OF THE LAND HE HAD TAKEN AWAY THAT THE KINGDOM MIGHT BE HUMBLE AND NOT LIFT ITSELF UP AND KEEP HIS COVENANT THAT IT MIGHT STAND

BUT HE REBELLED AGAINST HIM BY SENDING HIS AMBASSADORS TO EGYPT THAT THEY MIGHT GIVE HIM HORSES AND A LARGE ARMY

WILL HE THRIVE

CAN ONE ESCAPE WHO DOES SUCH THINGS

CAN HE BREAK THE COVENANT AND YET ESCAPE

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD SURELY IN THE PLACE WHERE THE KING DWELLS WHO MADE HIM KING WHOSE OATH HE DESPISED AND WHOSE COVENANT WITH HIM HE BROKE IN BABYLON HE SHALL DIE

PHARAOH WITH HIS MIGHTY ARMY AND GREAT COMPANY WILL NOT HELP HIM IN WAR WHEN MOUNDS ARE CAST UP AND SIEGE WALLS BUILT TO CUT OFF MANY LIVES

HE DESPISED THE OATH IN BREAKING THE COVENANT AND BEHOLD HE GAVE HIS HAND AND DID ALL THESE THINGS; HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD AS I LIVE SURELY IT IS MY OATH THAT HE DESPISED AND MY COVENANT THAT HE BROKE

I WILL RETURN IT UPON HIS HEAD

I WILL SPREAD MY NET OVER HIM AND HE SHALL BE TAKEN IN MY SNARE AND I WILL BRING HIM TO BABYLON AND ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH HIM THERE FOR THE TREACHERY HE HAS COMMITTED AGAINST ME

AND ALL THE PICK OF HIS TROOPS SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD AND THE SURVIVORS SHALL BE SCATTERED TO EVERY WIND AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN

 THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I MYSELF WILL TAKE A SPRIG FROM THE LOFTY TOP OF THE CEDAR AND WILL SET IT OUT

I WILL BREAK OFF FROM THE TOPMOST OF ITS YOUNG TWIGS A TENDER ONE AND I MYSELF WILL PLANT IT ON A HIGH AND LOFTY MOUNTAIN

ON THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHT OF ISRAEL WILL I PLANT IT THAT IT MAY BEAR BRANCHES AND PRODUCE FRUIT AND BECOME A NOBLE CEDAR

AND UNDER IT WILL DWELL EVERY KIND OF BIRD; IN THE SHADE OF ITS BRANCHES BIRDS OF EVERY SORT WILL NEST

AND ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; I BRING LOW THE HIGH TREE AND MAKE HIGH THE LOW TREE DRY UP THE GREEN TREE AND MAKE THE DRY TREE FLOURISH

I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN AND I WILL DO IT

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY REPEATING THIS PROVERB CONCERNING THE LAND OF ISRAEL 'THE FATHERS HAVE EATEN SOUR GRAPES AND THE CHILDREN'S TEETH ARE SET ON EDGE'

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD THIS PROVERB SHALL NO MORE BE USED BY YOU IN ISRAEL

BEHOLD ALL SOULS ARE MINE; THE SOUL OF THE FATHER AS WELL AS THE SOUL OF THE SON IS MINE THE SOUL WHO SINS SHALL DIE

IF A MAN IS RIGHTEOUS AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT IF HE DOES NOT EAT UPON THE MOUNTAINS OR LIFT UP HIS EYES TO THE IDOLS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL DOES NOT DEFILE HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE OR APPROACH A WOMAN IN HER TIME OF MENSTRUAL IMPURITY DOES NOT OPPRESS ANYONE BUT RESTORES TO THE DEBTOR HIS PLEDGE COMMITS NO ROBBERY GIVES HIS BREAD TO THE HUNGRY AND COVERS THE NAKED WITH A GARMENT DOES NOT LEND AT INTEREST OR TAKE ANY PROFIT WITHHOLDS HIS HAND FROM INJUSTICE EXECUTES TRUE JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WALKS IN MY STATUTES AND KEEPS MY RULES BY ACTING FAITHFULLYHE IS RIGHTEOUS; HE SHALL SURELY LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

IF HE FATHERS A SON WHO IS VIOLENT A SHEDDER OF BLOOD WHO DOES ANY OF THESE THINGS THOUGH HE HIMSELF DID NONE OF THESE THINGS WHO EVEN EATS UPON THE MOUNTAINS DEFILES HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE OPPRESSES THE POOR AND NEEDY COMMITS ROBBERY DOES NOT RESTORE THE PLEDGE LIFTS UP HIS EYES TO THE IDOLS COMMITS ABOMINATION LENDS AT INTEREST AND TAKES PROFIT; SHALL HE THEN LIVE

HE SHALL NOT LIVE

HE HAS DONE ALL THESE ABOMINATIONS; HE SHALL SURELY DIE; HIS BLOOD SHALL BE UPON HIMSELF

NOW SUPPOSE THIS MAN FATHERS A SON WHO SEES ALL THE SINS THAT HIS FATHER HAS DONE; HE SEES AND DOES NOT DO LIKEWISE HE DOES NOT EAT UPON THE MOUNTAINS OR LIFT UP HIS EYES TO THE IDOLS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL DOES NOT DEFILE HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE DOES NOT OPPRESS ANYONE EXACTS NO PLEDGE COMMITS NO ROBBERY BUT GIVES HIS BREAD TO THE HUNGRY AND COVERS THE NAKED WITH A GARMENT WITHHOLDS HIS HAND FROM INIQUITY TAKES NO INTEREST OR PROFIT OBEYS MY RULES AND WALKS IN MY STATUTES; HE SHALL NOT DIE FOR HIS FATHER'S INIQUITY; HE SHALL SURELY LIVE

AS FOR HIS FATHER BECAUSE HE PRACTICED EXTORTION ROBBED HIS BROTHER AND DID WHAT IS NOT GOOD AMONG HIS PEOPLE BEHOLD HE SHALL DIE FOR HIS INIQUITY

YET YOU SAY 'WHY SHOULD NOT THE SON SUFFER FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHER

' WHEN THE SON HAS DONE WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT AND HAS BEEN CAREFUL TO OBSERVE ALL MY STATUTES HE SHALL SURELY LIVE

THE SOUL WHO SINS SHALL DIE

THE SON SHALL NOT SUFFER FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHER NOR THE FATHER SUFFER FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE SON

THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE UPON HIMSELF AND THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WICKED SHALL BE UPON HIMSELF

BUT IF A WICKED PERSON TURNS AWAY FROM ALL HIS SINS THAT HE HAS COMMITTED AND KEEPS ALL MY STATUTES AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT HE SHALL SURELY LIVE; HE SHALL NOT DIE

NONE OF THE TRANSGRESSIONS THAT HE HAS COMMITTED SHALL BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM; FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT HE HAS DONE HE SHALL LIVE

HAVE I ANY PLEASURE IN THE DEATH OF THE WICKED DECLARES THE LORD GOD AND NOT RATHER THAT HE SHOULD TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE

BUT WHEN A RIGHTEOUS PERSON TURNS AWAY FROM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DOES INJUSTICE AND DOES THE SAME ABOMINATIONS THAT THE WICKED PERSON DOES SHALL HE LIVE

NONE OF THE RIGHTEOUS DEEDS THAT HE HAS DONE SHALL BE REMEMBERED; FOR THE TREACHERY OF WHICH HE IS GUILTY AND THE SIN HE HAS COMMITTED FOR THEM HE SHALL DIE

YET YOU SAY 'THE WAY OF THE LORD IS NOT JUST

' HEAR NOW O HOUSE OF ISRAEL IS MY WAY NOT JUST

IS IT NOT YOUR WAYS THAT ARE NOT JUST

WHEN A RIGHTEOUS PERSON TURNS AWAY FROM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DOES INJUSTICE HE SHALL DIE FOR IT; FOR THE INJUSTICE THAT HE HAS DONE HE SHALL DIE

AGAIN WHEN A WICKED PERSON TURNS AWAY FROM THE WICKEDNESS HE HAS COMMITTED AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT HE SHALL SAVE HIS LIFE

BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED AND TURNED AWAY FROM ALL THE TRANSGRESSIONS THAT HE HAD COMMITTED HE SHALL SURELY LIVE; HE SHALL NOT DIE

YET THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SAYS 'THE WAY OF THE LORD IS NOT JUST

' O HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE MY WAYS NOT JUST

IS IT NOT YOUR WAYS THAT ARE NOT JUST

THEREFORE I WILL JUDGE YOU O HOUSE OF ISRAEL EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

REPENT AND TURN FROM ALL YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS LEST INIQUITY BE YOUR RUIN

CAST AWAY FROM YOU ALL THE TRANSGRESSIONS THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED AND MAKE YOURSELVES A NEW HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT

WHY WILL YOU DIE O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

FOR I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE DEATH OF ANYONE DECLARES THE LORD GOD; SO TURN AND LIVE

AND YOU TAKE UP A LAMENTATION FOR THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL AND SAY WHAT WAS YOUR MOTHER

A LIONESS

AMONG LIONS SHE CROUCHED; IN THE MIDST OF YOUNG LIONS SHE REARED HER CUBS

AND SHE BROUGHT UP ONE OF HER CUBS; HE BECAME A YOUNG LION AND HE LEARNED TO CATCH PREY; HE DEVOURED MEN

THE NATIONS HEARD ABOUT HIM; HE WAS CAUGHT IN THEIR PIT AND THEY BROUGHT HIM WITH HOOKS TO THE LAND OF EGYPT

WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE WAITED IN VAIN THAT HER HOPE WAS LOST SHE TOOK ANOTHER OF HER CUBS AND MADE HIM A YOUNG LION

HE PROWLED AMONG THE LIONS; HE BECAME A YOUNG LION AND HE LEARNED TO CATCH PREY; HE DEVOURED MEN AND SEIZED THEIR WIDOWS

HE LAID WASTE THEIR CITIES AND THE LAND WAS APPALLED AND ALL WHO WERE IN IT AT THE SOUND OF HIS ROARING

THEN THE NATIONS SET AGAINST HIM FROM PROVINCES ON EVERY SIDE; THEY SPREAD THEIR NET OVER HIM; HE WAS TAKEN IN THEIR PIT

WITH HOOKS THEY PUT HIM IN A CAGE AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE KING OF BABYLON; THEY BROUGHT HIM INTO CUSTODY THAT HIS VOICE SHOULD NO MORE BE HEARD ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL

YOUR MOTHER WAS LIKE A VINE IN A VINEYARD PLANTED BY THE WATER FRUITFUL AND FULL OF BRANCHES BY REASON OF ABUNDANT WATER

ITS STRONG STEMS BECAME RULERS' SCEPTERS; IT TOWERED ALOFT AMONG THE THICK BOUGHS; IT WAS SEEN IN ITS HEIGHT WITH THE MASS OF ITS BRANCHES

BUT THE VINE WAS PLUCKED UP IN FURY CAST DOWN TO THE GROUND; THE EAST WIND DRIED UP ITS FRUIT; THEY WERE STRIPPED OFF AND WITHERED

AS FOR ITS STRONG STEM FIRE CONSUMED IT

NOW IT IS PLANTED IN THE WILDERNESS IN A DRY AND THIRSTY LAND

AND FIRE HAS GONE OUT FROM THE STEM OF ITS SHOOTS HAS CONSUMED ITS FRUIT SO THAT THERE REMAINS IN IT NO STRONG STEM NO SCEPTER FOR RULING

THIS IS A LAMENTATION AND HAS BECOME A LAMENTATION

IN THE SEVENTH YEAR IN THE FIFTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH CERTAIN OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL CAME TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD AND SAT BEFORE ME

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SPEAK TO THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD IS IT TO INQUIRE OF ME THAT YOU COME

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD I WILL NOT BE INQUIRED OF BY YOU

WILL YOU JUDGE THEM SON OF MAN WILL YOU JUDGE THEM

LET THEM KNOW THE ABOMINATIONS OF THEIR FATHERS AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD ON THE DAY WHEN I CHOSE ISRAEL I SWORE TO THE OFFSPRING OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB MAKING MYSELF KNOWN TO THEM IN THE LAND OF EGYPT; I SWORE TO THEM SAYING I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

ON THAT DAY I SWORE TO THEM THAT I WOULD BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT INTO A LAND THAT I HAD SEARCHED OUT FOR THEM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY THE MOST GLORIOUS OF ALL LANDS

AND I SAID TO THEM CAST AWAY THE DETESTABLE THINGS YOUR EYES FEAST ON EVERY ONE OF YOU AND DO NOT DEFILE YOURSELVES WITH THE IDOLS OF EGYPT; I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

BUT THEY REBELLED AGAINST ME AND WERE NOT WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME

NONE OF THEM CAST AWAY THE DETESTABLE THINGS THEIR EYES FEASTED ON NOR DID THEY FORSAKE THE IDOLS OF EGYPT

THEN I SAID I WOULD POUR OUT MY WRATH UPON THEM AND SPEND MY ANGER AGAINST THEM IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

BUT I ACTED FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE PROFANED IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS AMONG WHOM THEY LIVED IN WHOSE SIGHT I MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO THEM IN BRINGING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT

SO I LED THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE WILDERNESS

I GAVE THEM MY STATUTES AND MADE KNOWN TO THEM MY RULES BY WHICH IF A PERSON DOES THEM HE SHALL LIVE

MOREOVER I GAVE THEM MY SABBATHS AS A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THEM THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHO SANCTIFIES THEM

BUT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL REBELLED AGAINST ME IN THE WILDERNESS

THEY DID NOT WALK IN MY STATUTES BUT REJECTED MY RULES BY WHICH IF A PERSON DOES THEM HE SHALL LIVE; AND MY SABBATHS THEY GREATLY PROFANED

THEN I SAID I WOULD POUR OUT MY WRATH UPON THEM IN THE WILDERNESS TO MAKE A FULL END OF THEM

BUT I ACTED FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE PROFANED IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS IN WHOSE SIGHT I HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT

MOREOVER I SWORE TO THEM IN THE WILDERNESS THAT I WOULD NOT BRING THEM INTO THE LAND THAT I HAD GIVEN THEM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY THE MOST GLORIOUS OF ALL LANDS BECAUSE THEY REJECTED MY RULES AND DID NOT WALK IN MY STATUTES AND PROFANED MY SABBATHS; FOR THEIR HEART WENT AFTER THEIR IDOLS

NEVERTHELESS MY EYE SPARED THEM AND I DID NOT DESTROY THEM OR MAKE A FULL END OF THEM IN THE WILDERNESS

AND I SAID TO THEIR CHILDREN IN THE WILDERNESS DO NOT WALK IN THE STATUTES OF YOUR FATHERS NOR KEEP THEIR RULES NOR DEFILE YOURSELVES WITH THEIR IDOLS

I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD; WALK IN MY STATUTES AND BE CAREFUL TO OBEY MY RULES AND KEEP MY SABBATHS HOLY THAT THEY MAY BE A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND YOU THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

BUT THE CHILDREN REBELLED AGAINST ME

THEY DID NOT WALK IN MY STATUTES AND WERE NOT CAREFUL TO OBEY MY RULES BY WHICH IF A PERSON DOES THEM HE SHALL LIVE; THEY PROFANED MY SABBATHS

THEN I SAID I WOULD POUR OUT MY WRATH UPON THEM AND SPEND MY ANGER AGAINST THEM IN THE WILDERNESS

BUT I WITHHELD MY HAND AND ACTED FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE PROFANED IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS IN WHOSE SIGHT I HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT

MOREOVER I SWORE TO THEM IN THE WILDERNESS THAT I WOULD SCATTER THEM AMONG THE NATIONS AND DISPERSE THEM THROUGH THE COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT OBEYED MY RULES BUT HAD REJECTED MY STATUTES AND PROFANED MY SABBATHS AND THEIR EYES WERE SET ON THEIR FATHERS' IDOLS

MOREOVER I GAVE THEM STATUTES THAT WERE NOT GOOD AND RULES BY WHICH THEY COULD NOT HAVE LIFE AND I DEFILED THEM THROUGH THEIR VERY GIFTS IN THEIR OFFERING UP ALL THEIR FIRSTBORN THAT I MIGHT DEVASTATE THEM

I DID IT THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THEREFORE SON OF MAN SPEAK TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD IN THIS ALSO YOUR FATHERS BLASPHEMED ME BY DEALING TREACHEROUSLY WITH ME

FOR WHEN I HAD BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE THEM THEN WHEREVER THEY SAW ANY HIGH HILL OR ANY LEAFY TREE THERE THEY OFFERED THEIR SACRIFICES AND THERE THEY PRESENTED THE PROVOCATION OF THEIR OFFERING; THERE THEY SENT UP THEIR PLEASING AROMAS AND THERE THEY POURED OUT THEIR DRINK OFFERINGS

I SAID TO THEM WHAT IS THE HIGH PLACE TO WHICH YOU GO

SO ITS NAME IS CALLED BAMAH TO THIS DAY

 THEREFORE SAY TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WILL YOU DEFILE YOURSELVES AFTER THE MANNER OF YOUR FATHERS AND GO WHORING AFTER THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS

WHEN YOU PRESENT YOUR GIFTS AND OFFER UP YOUR CHILDREN IN FIRE YOU DEFILE YOURSELVES WITH ALL YOUR IDOLS TO THIS DAY

AND SHALL I BE INQUIRED OF BY YOU O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD I WILL NOT BE INQUIRED OF BY YOU

WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND SHALL NEVER HAPPENTHE THOUGHT 'LET US BE LIKE THE NATIONS LIKE THE TRIBES OF THE COUNTRIES AND WORSHIP WOOD AND STONE

' AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD SURELY WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND WITH WRATH POURED OUT I WILL BE KING OVER YOU

I WILL BRING YOU OUT FROM THE PEOPLES AND GATHER YOU OUT OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE YOU ARE SCATTERED WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM AND WITH WRATH POURED OUT

AND I WILL BRING YOU INTO THE WILDERNESS OF THE PEOPLES AND THERE I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOU FACE TO FACE

AS I ENTERED INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOUR FATHERS IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE LAND OF EGYPT SO I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOU DECLARES THE LORD GOD

I WILL MAKE YOU PASS UNDER THE ROD AND I WILL BRING YOU INTO THE BOND OF THE COVENANT

I WILL PURGE OUT THE REBELS FROM AMONG YOU AND THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS AGAINST ME

I WILL BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND WHERE THEY SOJOURN BUT THEY SHALL NOT ENTER THE LAND OF ISRAEL

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

AS FOR YOU O HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD GO SERVE EVERY ONE OF YOU HIS IDOLS NOW AND HEREAFTER IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME; BUT MY HOLY NAME YOU SHALL NO MORE PROFANE WITH YOUR GIFTS AND YOUR IDOLS

FOR ON MY HOLY MOUNTAIN THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHT OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD GOD THERE ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ALL OF THEM SHALL SERVE ME IN THE LAND

THERE I WILL ACCEPT THEM AND THERE I WILL REQUIRE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE CHOICEST OF YOUR GIFTS WITH ALL YOUR SACRED OFFERINGS

AS A PLEASING AROMA I WILL ACCEPT YOU WHEN I BRING YOU OUT FROM THE PEOPLES AND GATHER YOU OUT OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN SCATTERED

AND I WILL MANIFEST MY HOLINESS AMONG YOU IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I BRING YOU INTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL THE COUNTRY THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS

AND THERE YOU SHALL REMEMBER YOUR WAYS AND ALL YOUR DEEDS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE DEFILED YOURSELVES AND YOU SHALL LOATHE YOURSELVES FOR ALL THE EVILS THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I DEAL WITH YOU FOR MY NAME'S SAKE NOT ACCORDING TO YOUR EVIL WAYS NOR ACCORDING TO YOUR CORRUPT DEEDS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SET YOUR FACE TOWARD THE SOUTHLAND; PREACH AGAINST THE SOUTH AND PROPHESY AGAINST THE FOREST LAND IN THE NEGEB

SAY TO THE FOREST OF THE NEGEB HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL KINDLE A FIRE IN YOU AND IT SHALL DEVOUR EVERY GREEN TREE IN YOU AND EVERY DRY TREE

THE BLAZING FLAME SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED AND ALL FACES FROM SOUTH TO NORTH SHALL BE SCORCHED BY IT

ALL FLESH SHALL SEE THAT I THE LORD HAVE KINDLED IT; IT SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED

 THEN I SAID AH LORD GOD

THEY ARE SAYING OF ME 'IS HE NOT A MAKER OF PARABLES

'THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SET YOUR FACE TOWARD JERUSALEM AND PREACH AGAINST THE SANCTUARIES

PROPHESY AGAINST THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THE LAND OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU AND WILL DRAW MY SWORD FROM ITS SHEATH AND WILL CUT OFF FROM YOU BOTH RIGHTEOUS AND WICKED

BECAUSE I WILL CUT OFF FROM YOU BOTH RIGHTEOUS AND WICKED THEREFORE MY SWORD SHALL BE DRAWN FROM ITS SHEATH AGAINST ALL FLESH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH

AND ALL FLESH SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

I HAVE DRAWN MY SWORD FROM ITS SHEATH; IT SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED AGAIN

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN GROAN; WITH BREAKING HEART AND BITTER GRIEF GROAN BEFORE THEIR EYES

AND WHEN THEY SAY TO YOU 'WHY DO YOU GROAN

' YOU SHALL SAY 'BECAUSE OF THE NEWS THAT IT IS COMING

EVERY HEART WILL MELT AND ALL HANDS WILL BE FEEBLE; EVERY SPIRIT WILL FAINT AND ALL KNEES WILL BE WEAK AS WATER

BEHOLD IT IS COMING AND IT WILL BE FULFILLED' DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN PROPHESY AND SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD; SAY A SWORD A SWORD IS SHARPENED AND ALSO POLISHED SHARPENED FOR SLAUGHTER POLISHED TO FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING

OR SHALL WE REJOICE

YOU HAVE DESPISED THE ROD MY SON WITH EVERYTHING OF WOOD

 SO THE SWORD IS GIVEN TO BE POLISHED THAT IT MAY BE GRASPED IN THE HAND

IT IS SHARPENED AND POLISHED TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE SLAYER

CRY OUT AND WAIL SON OF MAN FOR IT IS AGAINST MY PEOPLE

IT IS AGAINST ALL THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL

THEY ARE DELIVERED OVER TO THE SWORD WITH MY PEOPLE

STRIKE THEREFORE UPON YOUR THIGH

FOR IT WILL NOT BE A TESTINGWHAT COULD IT DO IF YOU DESPISE THE ROD

 DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN PROPHESY

CLAP YOUR HANDS AND LET THE SWORD COME DOWN TWICE YES THREE TIMES THE SWORD FOR THOSE TO BE SLAIN

IT IS THE SWORD FOR THE GREAT SLAUGHTER WHICH SURROUNDS THEM THAT THEIR HEARTS MAY MELT AND MANY STUMBLE

AT ALL THEIR GATES I HAVE GIVEN THE GLITTERING SWORD

AH IT IS MADE LIKE LIGHTNING; IT IS TAKEN UP FOR SLAUGHTER

CUT SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT; SET YOURSELF TO THE LEFT WHEREVER YOUR FACE IS DIRECTED

I ALSO WILL CLAP MY HANDS AND I WILL SATISFY MY FURY; I THE LORD HAVE SPOKEN

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME AGAIN AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN MARK TWO WAYS FOR THE SWORD OF THE KING OF BABYLON TO COME

BOTH OF THEM SHALL COME FROM THE SAME LAND

AND MAKE A SIGNPOST; MAKE IT AT THE HEAD OF THE WAY TO A CITY

MARK A WAY FOR THE SWORD TO COME TO RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES AND TO JUDAH INTO JERUSALEM THE FORTIFIED

FOR THE KING OF BABYLON STANDS AT THE PARTING OF THE WAY AT THE HEAD OF THE TWO WAYS TO USE DIVINATION

HE SHAKES THE ARROWS; HE CONSULTS THE TERAPHIM; HE LOOKS AT THE LIVER

INTO HIS RIGHT HAND COMES THE DIVINATION FOR JERUSALEM TO SET BATTERING RAMS TO OPEN THE MOUTH WITH MURDER TO LIFT UP THE VOICE WITH SHOUTING TO SET BATTERING RAMS AGAINST THE GATES TO CAST UP MOUNDS TO BUILD SIEGE TOWERS

BUT TO THEM IT WILL SEEM LIKE A FALSE DIVINATION

THEY HAVE SWORN SOLEMN OATHS BUT HE BRINGS THEIR GUILT TO REMEMBRANCE THAT THEY MAY BE TAKEN

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE YOUR GUILT TO BE REMEMBERED IN THAT YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS ARE UNCOVERED SO THAT IN ALL YOUR DEEDS YOUR SINS APPEARBECAUSE YOU HAVE COME TO REMEMBRANCE YOU SHALL BE TAKEN IN HAND

AND YOU O PROFANE WICKED ONE PRINCE OF ISRAEL WHOSE DAY HAS COME THE TIME OF YOUR FINAL PUNISHMENT THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD REMOVE THE TURBAN AND TAKE OFF THE CROWN

THINGS SHALL NOT REMAIN AS THEY ARE

EXALT THAT WHICH IS LOW AND BRING LOW THAT WHICH IS EXALTED

A RUIN RUIN RUIN I WILL MAKE IT

THIS ALSO SHALL NOT BE UNTIL HE COMES THE ONE TO WHOM JUDGMENT BELONGS AND I WILL GIVE IT TO HIM

AND YOU SON OF MAN PROPHESY AND SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD CONCERNING THE AMMONITES AND CONCERNING THEIR REPROACH; SAY A SWORD A SWORD IS DRAWN FOR THE SLAUGHTER

IT IS POLISHED TO CONSUME AND TO FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING WHILE THEY SEE FOR YOU FALSE VISIONS WHILE THEY DIVINE LIES FOR YOUTO PLACE YOU ON THE NECKS OF THE PROFANE WICKED WHOSE DAY HAS COME THE TIME OF THEIR FINAL PUNISHMENT

RETURN IT TO ITS SHEATH

IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU WERE CREATED IN THE LAND OF YOUR ORIGIN I WILL JUDGE YOU

AND I WILL POUR OUT MY INDIGNATION UPON YOU; I WILL BLOW UPON YOU WITH THE FIRE OF MY WRATH AND I WILL DELIVER YOU INTO THE HANDS OF BRUTISH MEN SKILLFUL TO DESTROY

YOU SHALL BE FUEL FOR THE FIRE

YOUR BLOOD SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND

YOU SHALL BE NO MORE REMEMBERED FOR I THE LORD HAVE SPOKEN

AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SAYING AND YOU SON OF MAN WILL YOU JUDGE WILL YOU JUDGE THE BLOODY CITY

THEN DECLARE TO HER ALL HER ABOMINATIONS

YOU SHALL SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD A CITY THAT SHEDS BLOOD IN HER MIDST SO THAT HER TIME MAY COME AND THAT MAKES IDOLS TO DEFILE HERSELF

YOU HAVE BECOME GUILTY BY THE BLOOD THAT YOU HAVE SHED AND DEFILED BY THE IDOLS THAT YOU HAVE MADE AND YOU HAVE BROUGHT YOUR DAYS NEAR THE APPOINTED TIME OF YOUR YEARS HAS COME

THEREFORE I HAVE MADE YOU A REPROACH TO THE NATIONS AND A MOCKERY TO ALL THE COUNTRIES

THOSE WHO ARE NEAR AND THOSE WHO ARE FAR FROM YOU WILL MOCK YOU; YOUR NAME IS DEFILED; YOU ARE FULL OF TUMULT

BEHOLD THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL IN YOU EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS POWER HAVE BEEN BENT ON SHEDDING BLOOD

FATHER AND MOTHER ARE TREATED WITH CONTEMPT IN YOU; THE SOJOURNER SUFFERS EXTORTION IN YOUR MIDST; THE FATHERLESS AND THE WIDOW ARE WRONGED IN YOU

YOU HAVE DESPISED MY HOLY THINGS AND PROFANED MY SABBATHS

THERE ARE MEN IN YOU WHO SLANDER TO SHED BLOOD AND PEOPLE IN YOU WHO EAT ON THE MOUNTAINS; THEY COMMIT LEWDNESS IN YOUR MIDST

IN YOU MEN UNCOVER THEIR FATHERS' NAKEDNESS; IN YOU THEY VIOLATE WOMEN WHO ARE UNCLEAN IN THEIR MENSTRUAL IMPURITY

ONE COMMITS ABOMINATION WITH HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE; ANOTHER LEWDLY DEFILES HIS DAUGHTERINLAW; ANOTHER IN YOU VIOLATES HIS SISTER HIS FATHER'S DAUGHTER

IN YOU THEY TAKE BRIBES TO SHED BLOOD; YOU TAKE INTEREST AND PROFIT AND MAKE GAIN OF YOUR NEIGHBORS BY EXTORTION; BUT ME YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN DECLARES THE LORD GOD

BEHOLD I STRIKE MY HAND AT THE DISHONEST GAIN THAT YOU HAVE MADE AND AT THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN IN YOUR MIDST

CAN YOUR COURAGE ENDURE OR CAN YOUR HANDS BE STRONG IN THE DAYS THAT I SHALL DEAL WITH YOU

I THE LORD HAVE SPOKEN AND I WILL DO IT

I WILL SCATTER YOU AMONG THE NATIONS AND DISPERSE YOU THROUGH THE COUNTRIES AND I WILL CONSUME YOUR UNCLEANNESS OUT OF YOU

AND YOU SHALL BE PROFANED BY YOUR OWN DOING IN THE SIGHT OF THE NATIONS AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL HAS BECOME DROSS TO ME; ALL OF THEM ARE BRONZE AND TIN AND IRON AND LEAD IN THE FURNACE; THEY ARE DROSS OF SILVER

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL BECOME DROSS THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL GATHER YOU INTO THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM

AS ONE GATHERS SILVER AND BRONZE AND IRON AND LEAD AND TIN INTO A FURNACE TO BLOW THE FIRE ON IT IN ORDER TO MELT IT SO I WILL GATHER YOU IN MY ANGER AND IN MY WRATH AND I WILL PUT YOU IN AND MELT YOU

I WILL GATHER YOU AND BLOW ON YOU WITH THE FIRE OF MY WRATH AND YOU SHALL BE MELTED IN THE MIDST OF IT

AS SILVER IS MELTED IN A FURNACE SO YOU SHALL BE MELTED IN THE MIDST OF IT AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; I HAVE POURED OUT MY WRATH UPON YOU

 AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SAY TO HER YOU ARE A LAND THAT IS NOT CLEANSED OR RAINED UPON IN THE DAY OF INDIGNATION

THE CONSPIRACY OF HER PROPHETS IN HER MIDST IS LIKE A ROARING LION TEARING THE PREY; THEY HAVE DEVOURED HUMAN LIVES; THEY HAVE TAKEN TREASURE AND PRECIOUS THINGS; THEY HAVE MADE MANY WIDOWS IN HER MIDST

HER PRIESTS HAVE DONE VIOLENCE TO MY LAW AND HAVE PROFANED MY HOLY THINGS

THEY HAVE MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HOLY AND THE COMMON NEITHER HAVE THEY TAUGHT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN AND THEY HAVE DISREGARDED MY SABBATHS SO THAT I AM PROFANED AMONG THEM

HER PRINCES IN HER MIDST ARE LIKE WOLVES TEARING THE PREY SHEDDING BLOOD DESTROYING LIVES TO GET DISHONEST GAIN

AND HER PROPHETS HAVE SMEARED WHITEWASH FOR THEM SEEING FALSE VISIONS AND DIVINING LIES FOR THEM SAYING 'THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD' WHEN THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN

THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND HAVE PRACTICED EXTORTION AND COMMITTED ROBBERY

THEY HAVE OPPRESSED THE POOR AND NEEDY AND HAVE EXTORTED FROM THE SOJOURNER WITHOUT JUSTICE

AND I SOUGHT FOR A MAN AMONG THEM WHO SHOULD BUILD UP THE WALL AND STAND IN THE BREACH BEFORE ME FOR THE LAND THAT I SHOULD NOT DESTROY IT BUT I FOUND NONE

THEREFORE I HAVE POURED OUT MY INDIGNATION UPON THEM

I HAVE CONSUMED THEM WITH THE FIRE OF MY WRATH

I HAVE RETURNED THEIR WAY UPON THEIR HEADS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN THERE WERE TWO WOMEN THE DAUGHTERS OF ONE MOTHER

THEY PLAYED THE WHORE IN EGYPT; THEY PLAYED THE WHORE IN THEIR YOUTH; THERE THEIR BREASTS WERE PRESSED AND THEIR VIRGIN BOSOMS HANDLED

OHOLAH WAS THE NAME OF THE ELDER AND OHOLIBAH THE NAME OF HER SISTER

THEY BECAME MINE AND THEY BORE SONS AND DAUGHTERS

AS FOR THEIR NAMES OHOLAH IS SAMARIA AND OHOLIBAH IS JERUSALEM

OHOLAH PLAYED THE WHORE WHILE SHE WAS MINE AND SHE LUSTED AFTER HER LOVERS THE ASSYRIANS WARRIORS CLOTHED IN PURPLE GOVERNORS AND COMMANDERS ALL OF THEM DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN HORSEMEN RIDING ON HORSES

SHE BESTOWED HER WHORING UPON THEM THE CHOICEST MEN OF ASSYRIA ALL OF THEM AND SHE DEFILED HERSELF WITH ALL THE IDOLS OF EVERYONE AFTER WHOM SHE LUSTED

SHE DID NOT GIVE UP HER WHORING THAT SHE HAD BEGUN IN EGYPT; FOR IN HER YOUTH MEN HAD LAIN WITH HER AND HANDLED HER VIRGIN BOSOM AND POURED OUT THEIR WHORING LUST UPON HER

THEREFORE I DELIVERED HER INTO THE HANDS OF HER LOVERS INTO THE HANDS OF THE ASSYRIANS AFTER WHOM SHE LUSTED

THESE UNCOVERED HER NAKEDNESS; THEY SEIZED HER SONS AND HER DAUGHTERS; AND AS FOR HER THEY KILLED HER WITH THE SWORD; AND SHE BECAME A BYWORD AMONG WOMEN WHEN JUDGMENT HAD BEEN EXECUTED ON HER

HER SISTER OHOLIBAH SAW THIS AND SHE BECAME MORE CORRUPT THAN HER SISTER IN HER LUST AND IN HER WHORING WHICH WAS WORSE THAN THAT OF HER SISTER

SHE LUSTED AFTER THE ASSYRIANS GOVERNORS AND COMMANDERS WARRIORS CLOTHED IN FULL ARMOR HORSEMEN RIDING ON HORSES ALL OF THEM DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN

AND I SAW THAT SHE WAS DEFILED; THEY BOTH TOOK THE SAME WAY

BUT SHE CARRIED HER WHORING FURTHER

SHE SAW MEN PORTRAYED ON THE WALL THE IMAGES OF THE CHALDEANS PORTRAYED IN VERMILION WEARING BELTS ON THEIR WAISTS WITH FLOWING TURBANS ON THEIR HEADS ALL OF THEM HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF OFFICERS A LIKENESS OF BABYLONIANS WHOSE NATIVE LAND WAS CHALDEA

WHEN SHE SAW THEM SHE LUSTED AFTER THEM AND SENT MESSENGERS TO THEM IN CHALDEA

AND THE BABYLONIANS CAME TO HER INTO THE BED OF LOVE AND THEY DEFILED HER WITH THEIR WHORING LUST

AND AFTER SHE WAS DEFILED BY THEM SHE TURNED FROM THEM IN DISGUST

WHEN SHE CARRIED ON HER WHORING SO OPENLY AND FLAUNTED HER NAKEDNESS I TURNED IN DISGUST FROM HER AS I HAD TURNED IN DISGUST FROM HER SISTER

YET SHE INCREASED HER WHORING REMEMBERING THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH WHEN SHE PLAYED THE WHORE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND LUSTED AFTER HER PARAMOURS THERE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE LIKE THOSE OF DONKEYS AND WHOSE ISSUE WAS LIKE THAT OF HORSES

THUS YOU LONGED FOR THE LEWDNESS OF YOUR YOUTH WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HANDLED YOUR BOSOM AND PRESSED YOUR YOUNG BREASTS

 THEREFORE O OHOLIBAH THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL STIR UP AGAINST YOU YOUR LOVERS FROM WHOM YOU TURNED IN DISGUST AND I WILL BRING THEM AGAINST YOU FROM EVERY SIDE THE BABYLONIANS AND ALL THE CHALDEANS PEKOD AND SHOA AND KOA AND ALL THE ASSYRIANS WITH THEM DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN GOVERNORS AND COMMANDERS ALL OF THEM OFFICERS AND MEN OF RENOWN ALL OF THEM RIDING ON HORSES

AND THEY SHALL COME AGAINST YOU FROM THE NORTH WITH CHARIOTS AND WAGONS AND A HOST OF PEOPLES

THEY SHALL SET THEMSELVES AGAINST YOU ON EVERY SIDE WITH BUCKLER SHIELD AND HELMET; AND I WILL COMMIT THE JUDGMENT TO THEM AND THEY SHALL JUDGE YOU ACCORDING TO THEIR JUDGMENTS

AND I WILL DIRECT MY JEALOUSY AGAINST YOU THAT THEY MAY DEAL WITH YOU IN FURY

THEY SHALL CUT OFF YOUR NOSE AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR SURVIVORS SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD

THEY SHALL SEIZE YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS AND YOUR SURVIVORS SHALL BE DEVOURED BY FIRE

THEY SHALL ALSO STRIP YOU OF YOUR CLOTHES AND TAKE AWAY YOUR BEAUTIFUL JEWELS

THUS I WILL PUT AN END TO YOUR LEWDNESS AND YOUR WHORING BEGUN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SO THAT YOU SHALL NOT LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO THEM OR REMEMBER EGYPT ANYMORE

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL DELIVER YOU INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOM YOU HATE INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE FROM WHOM YOU TURNED IN DISGUST AND THEY SHALL DEAL WITH YOU IN HATRED AND TAKE AWAY ALL THE FRUIT OF YOUR LABOR AND LEAVE YOU NAKED AND BARE AND THE NAKEDNESS OF YOUR WHORING SHALL BE UNCOVERED

YOUR LEWDNESS AND YOUR WHORING HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOU BECAUSE YOU PLAYED THE WHORE WITH THE NATIONS AND DEFILED YOURSELF WITH THEIR IDOLS

YOU HAVE GONE THE WAY OF YOUR SISTER; THEREFORE I WILL GIVE HER CUP INTO YOUR HAND

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD YOU SHALL DRINK YOUR SISTER'S CUP THAT IS DEEP AND LARGE; YOU SHALL BE LAUGHED AT AND HELD IN DERISION FOR IT CONTAINS MUCH; YOU WILL BE FILLED WITH DRUNKENNESS AND SORROW

A CUP OF HORROR AND DESOLATION THE CUP OF YOUR SISTER SAMARIA; YOU SHALL DRINK IT AND DRAIN IT OUT AND GNAW ITS SHARDS AND TEAR YOUR BREASTS;FOR I HAVE SPOKEN DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ME AND CAST ME BEHIND YOUR BACK YOU YOURSELF MUST BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR LEWDNESS AND WHORING

 THE LORD SAID TO ME SON OF MAN WILL YOU JUDGE OHOLAH AND OHOLIBAH

DECLARE TO THEM THEIR ABOMINATIONS

FOR THEY HAVE COMMITTED ADULTERY AND BLOOD IS ON THEIR HANDS

WITH THEIR IDOLS THEY HAVE COMMITTED ADULTERY AND THEY HAVE EVEN OFFERED UP TO THEM FOR FOOD THE CHILDREN WHOM THEY HAD BORNE TO ME

MOREOVER THIS THEY HAVE DONE TO ME THEY HAVE DEFILED MY SANCTUARY ON THE SAME DAY AND PROFANED MY SABBATHS

FOR WHEN THEY HAD SLAUGHTERED THEIR CHILDREN IN SACRIFICE TO THEIR IDOLS ON THE SAME DAY THEY CAME INTO MY SANCTUARY TO PROFANE IT

AND BEHOLD THIS IS WHAT THEY DID IN MY HOUSE

THEY EVEN SENT FOR MEN TO COME FROM AFAR TO WHOM A MESSENGER WAS SENT; AND BEHOLD THEY CAME

FOR THEM YOU BATHED YOURSELF PAINTED YOUR EYES AND ADORNED YOURSELF WITH ORNAMENTS

YOU SAT ON A STATELY COUCH WITH A TABLE SPREAD BEFORE IT ON WHICH YOU HAD PLACED MY INCENSE AND MY OIL

THE SOUND OF A CAREFREE MULTITUDE WAS WITH HER; AND WITH MEN OF THE COMMON SORT DRUNKARDS WERE BROUGHT FROM THE WILDERNESS; AND THEY PUT BRACELETS ON THE HANDS OF THE WOMEN AND BEAUTIFUL CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS

THEN I SAID OF HER WHO WAS WORN OUT BY ADULTERY NOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE HER FOR A WHORE EVEN HER

FOR THEY HAVE GONE IN TO HER AS MEN GO IN TO A PROSTITUTE

THUS THEY WENT IN TO OHOLAH AND TO OHOLIBAH LEWD WOMEN

BUT RIGHTEOUS MEN SHALL PASS JUDGMENT ON THEM WITH THE SENTENCE OF ADULTERESSES AND WITH THE SENTENCE OF WOMEN WHO SHED BLOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE ADULTERESSES AND BLOOD IS ON THEIR HANDS

 FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BRING UP A VAST HOST AGAINST THEM AND MAKE THEM AN OBJECT OF TERROR AND A PLUNDER

AND THE HOST SHALL STONE THEM AND CUT THEM DOWN WITH THEIR SWORDS

THEY SHALL KILL THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS AND BURN UP THEIR HOUSES

THUS WILL I PUT AN END TO LEWDNESS IN THE LAND THAT ALL WOMEN MAY TAKE WARNING AND NOT COMMIT LEWDNESS AS YOU HAVE DONE

AND THEY SHALL RETURN YOUR LEWDNESS UPON YOU AND YOU SHALL BEAR THE PENALTY FOR YOUR SINFUL IDOLATRY AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD GOD

IN THE NINTH YEAR IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN WRITE DOWN THE NAME OF THIS DAY THIS VERY DAY

THE KING OF BABYLON HAS LAID SIEGE TO JERUSALEM THIS VERY DAY

AND UTTER A PARABLE TO THE REBELLIOUS HOUSE AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD SET ON THE POT SET IT ON; POUR IN WATER ALSO; PUT IN IT THE PIECES OF MEAT ALL THE GOOD PIECES THE THIGH AND THE SHOULDER; FILL IT WITH CHOICE BONES

TAKE THE CHOICEST ONE OF THE FLOCK; PILE THE LOGS UNDER IT; BOIL IT WELL; SEETHE ALSO ITS BONES IN IT

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WOE TO THE BLOODY CITY TO THE POT WHOSE CORROSION IS IN IT AND WHOSE CORROSION HAS NOT GONE OUT OF IT

TAKE OUT OF IT PIECE AFTER PIECE WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHOICE

FOR THE BLOOD SHE HAS SHED IS IN HER MIDST; SHE PUT IT ON THE BARE ROCK; SHE DID NOT POUR IT OUT ON THE GROUND TO COVER IT WITH DUST

TO ROUSE MY WRATH TO TAKE VENGEANCE I HAVE SET ON THE BARE ROCK THE BLOOD SHE HAS SHED THAT IT MAY NOT BE COVERED

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WOE TO THE BLOODY CITY

I ALSO WILL MAKE THE PILE GREAT

HEAP ON THE LOGS KINDLE THE FIRE BOIL THE MEAT WELL MIX IN THE SPICES AND LET THE BONES BE BURNED UP

THEN SET IT EMPTY UPON THE COALS THAT IT MAY BECOME HOT AND ITS COPPER MAY BURN THAT ITS UNCLEANNESS MAY BE MELTED IN IT ITS CORROSION CONSUMED

SHE HAS WEARIED HERSELF WITH TOIL; ITS ABUNDANT CORROSION DOES NOT GO OUT OF IT

INTO THE FIRE WITH ITS CORROSION

ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR UNCLEAN LEWDNESS BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE CLEANSED YOU AND YOU WERE NOT CLEANSED FROM YOUR UNCLEANNESS YOU SHALL NOT BE CLEANSED ANYMORE TILL I HAVE SATISFIED MY FURY UPON YOU

I AM THE LORD

I HAVE SPOKEN; IT SHALL COME TO PASS; I WILL DO IT

I WILL NOT GO BACK; I WILL NOT SPARE; I WILL NOT RELENT; ACCORDING TO YOUR WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS YOU WILL BE JUDGED DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO TAKE THE DELIGHT OF YOUR EYES AWAY FROM YOU AT A STROKE; YET YOU SHALL NOT MOURN OR WEEP NOR SHALL YOUR TEARS RUN DOWN

SIGH BUT NOT ALOUD; MAKE NO MOURNING FOR THE DEAD

BIND ON YOUR TURBAN AND PUT YOUR SHOES ON YOUR FEET; DO NOT COVER YOUR LIPS NOR EAT THE BREAD OF MEN

 SO I SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE MORNING AND AT EVENING MY WIFE DIED

AND ON THE NEXT MORNING I DID AS I WAS COMMANDED

AND THE PEOPLE SAID TO ME WILL YOU NOT TELL US WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN FOR US THAT YOU ARE ACTING THUS

 THEN I SAID TO THEM THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME 'SAY TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL PROFANE MY SANCTUARY THE PRIDE OF YOUR POWER THE DELIGHT OF YOUR EYES AND THE YEARNING OF YOUR SOUL AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS WHOM YOU LEFT BEHIND SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD

AND YOU SHALL DO AS I HAVE DONE; YOU SHALL NOT COVER YOUR LIPS NOR EAT THE BREAD OF MEN

YOUR TURBANS SHALL BE ON YOUR HEADS AND YOUR SHOES ON YOUR FEET; YOU SHALL NOT MOURN OR WEEP BUT YOU SHALL ROT AWAY IN YOUR INIQUITIES AND GROAN TO ONE ANOTHER

THUS SHALL EZEKIEL BE TO YOU A SIGN; ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HE HAS DONE YOU SHALL DO

BEHOLD ASSYRIA WAS A CEDAR IN LEBANON WITH BEAUTIFUL BRANCHES AND FOREST SHADE AND OF TOWERING HEIGHT ITS TOP AMONG THE CLOUDS

THE WATERS NOURISHED IT; THE DEEP MADE IT GROW TALL MAKING ITS RIVERS FLOW AROUND THE PLACE OF ITS PLANTING SENDING FORTH ITS STREAMS TO ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD

SO IT TOWERED HIGH ABOVE ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD; ITS BOUGHS GREW LARGE AND ITS BRANCHES LONG FROM ABUNDANT WATER IN ITS SHOOTS

ALL THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS MADE THEIR NESTS IN ITS BOUGHS; UNDER ITS BRANCHES ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD GAVE BIRTH TO THEIR YOUNG AND UNDER ITS SHADOW LIVED ALL GREAT NATIONS

IT WAS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS GREATNESS IN THE LENGTH OF ITS BRANCHES; FOR ITS ROOTS WENT DOWN TO ABUNDANT WATERS

THE CEDARS IN THE GARDEN OF GOD COULD NOT RIVAL IT NOR THE FIR TREES EQUAL ITS BOUGHS; NEITHER WERE THE PLANE TREES LIKE ITS BRANCHES; NO TREE IN THE GARDEN OF GOD WAS ITS EQUAL IN BEAUTY

I MADE IT BEAUTIFUL IN THE MASS OF ITS BRANCHES AND ALL THE TREES OF EDEN ENVIED IT THAT WERE IN THE GARDEN OF GOD

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE IT TOWERED HIGH AND SET ITS TOP AMONG THE CLOUDS AND ITS HEART WAS PROUD OF ITS HEIGHT I WILL GIVE IT INTO THE HAND OF A MIGHTY ONE OF THE NATIONS

HE SHALL SURELY DEAL WITH IT AS ITS WICKEDNESS DESERVES

I HAVE CAST IT OUT

FOREIGNERS THE MOST RUTHLESS OF NATIONS HAVE CUT IT DOWN AND LEFT IT

ON THE MOUNTAINS AND IN ALL THE VALLEYS ITS BRANCHES HAVE FALLEN AND ITS BOUGHS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN ALL THE RAVINES OF THE LAND AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH HAVE GONE AWAY FROM ITS SHADOW AND LEFT IT

ON ITS FALLEN TRUNK DWELL ALL THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS AND ON ITS BRANCHES ARE ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD

ALL THIS IS IN ORDER THAT NO TREES BY THE WATERS MAY GROW TO TOWERING HEIGHT OR SET THEIR TOPS AMONG THE CLOUDS AND THAT NO TREES THAT DRINK WATER MAY REACH UP TO THEM IN HEIGHT

FOR THEY ARE ALL GIVEN OVER TO DEATH TO THE WORLD BELOW AMONG THE CHILDREN OF MAN WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD ON THE DAY THE CEDAR WENT DOWN TO SHEOL I CAUSED MOURNING; I CLOSED THE DEEP OVER IT AND RESTRAINED ITS RIVERS AND MANY WATERS WERE STOPPED

I CLOTHED LEBANON IN GLOOM FOR IT AND ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD FAINTED BECAUSE OF IT

I MADE THE NATIONS QUAKE AT THE SOUND OF ITS FALL WHEN I CAST IT DOWN TO SHEOL WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT

AND ALL THE TREES OF EDEN THE CHOICE AND BEST OF LEBANON ALL THAT DRINK WATER WERE COMFORTED IN THE WORLD BELOW

THEY ALSO WENT DOWN TO SHEOL WITH IT TO THOSE WHO ARE SLAIN BY THE SWORD; YES THOSE WHO WERE ITS ARM WHO LIVED UNDER ITS SHADOW AMONG THE NATIONS

WHOM ARE YOU THUS LIKE IN GLORY AND IN GREATNESS AMONG THE TREES OF EDEN

I WILL STREW YOUR FLESH UPON THE MOUNTAINS AND FILL THE VALLEYS WITH YOUR CARCASS

I WILL DRENCH THE LAND EVEN TO THE MOUNTAINS WITH YOUR FLOWING BLOOD AND THE RAVINES WILL BE FULL OF YOU

WHEN I BLOT YOU OUT I WILL COVER THE HEAVENS AND MAKE THEIR STARS DARK; I WILL COVER THE SUN WITH A CLOUD AND THE MOON SHALL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT

ALL THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF HEAVEN WILL I MAKE DARK OVER YOU AND PUT DARKNESS ON YOUR LAND DECLARES THE LORD GOD

I WILL TROUBLE THE HEARTS OF MANY PEOPLES WHEN I BRING YOUR DESTRUCTION AMONG THE NATIONS INTO THE COUNTRIES THAT YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN

I WILL MAKE MANY PEOPLES APPALLED AT YOU AND THE HAIR OF THEIR KINGS SHALL BRISTLE WITH HORROR BECAUSE OF YOU WHEN I BRANDISH MY SWORD BEFORE THEM

THEY SHALL TREMBLE EVERY MOMENT EVERY ONE FOR HIS OWN LIFE ON THE DAY OF YOUR DOWNFALL

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THE SWORD OF THE KING OF BABYLON SHALL COME UPON YOU

I WILL CAUSE YOUR MULTITUDE TO FALL BY THE SWORDS OF MIGHTY ONES ALL OF THEM MOST RUTHLESS OF NATIONS

THEY SHALL BRING TO RUIN THE PRIDE OF EGYPT AND ALL ITS MULTITUDE SHALL PERISH

I WILL DESTROY ALL ITS BEASTS FROM BESIDE MANY WATERS; AND NO FOOT OF MAN SHALL TROUBLE THEM ANYMORE NOR SHALL THE HOOFS OF BEASTS TROUBLE THEM

THEN I WILL MAKE THEIR WATERS CLEAR AND CAUSE THEIR RIVERS TO RUN LIKE OIL DECLARES THE LORD GOD

WHEN I MAKE THE LAND OF EGYPT DESOLATE AND WHEN THE LAND IS DESOLATE OF ALL THAT FILLS IT WHEN I STRIKE DOWN ALL WHO DWELL IN IT THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THIS IS A LAMENTATION THAT SHALL BE CHANTED; THE DAUGHTERS OF THE NATIONS SHALL CHANT IT; OVER EGYPT AND OVER ALL HER MULTITUDE SHALL THEY CHANT IT DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 IN THE TWELFTH YEAR IN THE TWELFTH MONTH ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN WAIL OVER THE MULTITUDE OF EGYPT AND SEND THEM DOWN HER AND THE DAUGHTERS OF MAJESTIC NATIONS TO THE WORLD BELOW TO THOSE WHO HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE PIT 'WHOM DO YOU SURPASS IN BEAUTY

WHEN PHARAOH SEES THEM HE WILL BE COMFORTED FOR ALL HIS MULTITUDE PHARAOH AND ALL HIS ARMY SLAIN BY THE SWORD DECLARES THE LORD GOD

FOR I SPREAD TERROR IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING; AND HE SHALL BE LAID TO REST AMONG THE UNCIRCUMCISED WITH THOSE WHO ARE SLAIN BY THE SWORD PHARAOH AND ALL HIS MULTITUDE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SPEAK TO YOUR PEOPLE AND SAY TO THEM IF I BRING THE SWORD UPON A LAND AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND TAKE A MAN FROM AMONG THEM AND MAKE HIM THEIR WATCHMAN AND IF HE SEES THE SWORD COMING UPON THE LAND AND BLOWS THE TRUMPET AND WARNS THE PEOPLE THEN IF ANYONE WHO HEARS THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET DOES NOT TAKE WARNING AND THE SWORD COMES AND TAKES HIM AWAY HIS BLOOD SHALL BE UPON HIS OWN HEAD

HE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET AND DID NOT TAKE WARNING; HIS BLOOD SHALL BE UPON HIMSELF

BUT IF HE HAD TAKEN WARNING HE WOULD HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE

BUT IF THE WATCHMAN SEES THE SWORD COMING AND DOES NOT BLOW THE TRUMPET SO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT WARNED AND THE SWORD COMES AND TAKES ANY ONE OF THEM THAT PERSON IS TAKEN AWAY IN HIS INIQUITY BUT HIS BLOOD I WILL REQUIRE AT THE WATCHMAN'S HAND

SO YOU SON OF MAN I HAVE MADE A WATCHMAN FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

WHENEVER YOU HEAR A WORD FROM MY MOUTH YOU SHALL GIVE THEM WARNING FROM ME

IF I SAY TO THE WICKED O WICKED ONE YOU SHALL SURELY DIE AND YOU DO NOT SPEAK TO WARN THE WICKED TO TURN FROM HIS WAY THAT WICKED PERSON SHALL DIE IN HIS INIQUITY BUT HIS BLOOD I WILL REQUIRE AT YOUR HAND

BUT IF YOU WARN THE WICKED TO TURN FROM HIS WAY AND HE DOES NOT TURN FROM HIS WAY THAT PERSON SHALL DIE IN HIS INIQUITY BUT YOU WILL HAVE DELIVERED YOUR SOUL

AND YOU SON OF MAN SAY TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS HAVE YOU SAID 'SURELY OUR TRANSGRESSIONS AND OUR SINS ARE UPON US AND WE ROT AWAY BECAUSE OF THEM

HOW THEN CAN WE LIVE

' SAY TO THEM AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE DEATH OF THE WICKED BUT THAT THE WICKED TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE; TURN BACK TURN BACK FROM YOUR EVIL WAYS FOR WHY WILL YOU DIE O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

AND YOU SON OF MAN SAY TO YOUR PEOPLE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL NOT DELIVER HIM WHEN HE TRANSGRESSES AND AS FOR THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WICKED HE SHALL NOT FALL BY IT WHEN HE TURNS FROM HIS WICKEDNESS AND THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE BY HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS WHEN HE SINS

THOUGH I SAY TO THE RIGHTEOUS THAT HE SHALL SURELY LIVE YET IF HE TRUSTS IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DOES INJUSTICE NONE OF HIS RIGHTEOUS DEEDS SHALL BE REMEMBERED BUT IN HIS INJUSTICE THAT HE HAS DONE HE SHALL DIE

AGAIN THOUGH I SAY TO THE WICKED 'YOU SHALL SURELY DIE' YET IF HE TURNS FROM HIS SIN AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT IF THE WICKED RESTORES THE PLEDGE GIVES BACK WHAT HE HAS TAKEN BY ROBBERY AND WALKS IN THE STATUTES OF LIFE NOT DOING INJUSTICE HE SHALL SURELY LIVE; HE SHALL NOT DIE

NONE OF THE SINS THAT HE HAS COMMITTED SHALL BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM

HE HAS DONE WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT; HE SHALL SURELY LIVE

YET YOUR PEOPLE SAY 'THE WAY OF THE LORD IS NOT JUST' WHEN IT IS THEIR OWN WAY THAT IS NOT JUST

WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS TURNS FROM HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DOES INJUSTICE HE SHALL DIE FOR IT

AND WHEN THE WICKED TURNS FROM HIS WICKEDNESS AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT HE SHALL LIVE BY THEM

YET YOU SAY 'THE WAY OF THE LORD IS NOT JUST

' O HOUSE OF ISRAEL I WILL JUDGE EACH OF YOU ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS

 IN THE TWELFTH YEAR OF OUR EXILE IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE FIFTH DAY OF THE MONTH A FUGITIVE FROM JERUSALEM CAME TO ME AND SAID THE CITY HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN

 NOW THE HAND OF THE LORD HAD BEEN UPON ME THE EVENING BEFORE THE FUGITIVE CAME; AND HE HAD OPENED MY MOUTH BY THE TIME THE MAN CAME TO ME IN THE MORNING SO MY MOUTH WAS OPENED AND I WAS NO LONGER MUTE

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN THE INHABITANTS OF THESE WASTE PLACES IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL KEEP SAYING 'ABRAHAM WAS ONLY ONE MAN YET HE GOT POSSESSION OF THE LAND; BUT WE ARE MANY; THE LAND IS SURELY GIVEN US TO POSSESS

' THEREFORE SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD YOU EAT FLESH WITH THE BLOOD AND LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO YOUR IDOLS AND SHED BLOOD; SHALL YOU THEN POSSESS THE LAND

YOU RELY ON THE SWORD YOU COMMIT ABOMINATIONS AND EACH OF YOU DEFILES HIS NEIGHBOR'S WIFE; SHALL YOU THEN POSSESS THE LAND

SAY THIS TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD AS I LIVE SURELY THOSE WHO ARE IN THE WASTE PLACES SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD AND WHOEVER IS IN THE OPEN FIELD I WILL GIVE TO THE BEASTS TO BE DEVOURED AND THOSE WHO ARE IN STRONGHOLDS AND IN CAVES SHALL DIE BY PESTILENCE

AND I WILL MAKE THE LAND A DESOLATION AND A WASTE AND HER PROUD MIGHT SHALL COME TO AN END AND THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL SHALL BE SO DESOLATE THAT NONE WILL PASS THROUGH

THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I HAVE MADE THE LAND A DESOLATION AND A WASTE BECAUSE OF ALL THEIR ABOMINATIONS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN YOUR PEOPLE WHO TALK TOGETHER ABOUT YOU BY THE WALLS AND AT THE DOORS OF THE HOUSES SAY TO ONE ANOTHER EACH TO HIS BROTHER 'COME AND HEAR WHAT THE WORD IS THAT COMES FROM THE LORD

' AND THEY COME TO YOU AS PEOPLE COME AND THEY SIT BEFORE YOU AS MY PEOPLE AND THEY HEAR WHAT YOU SAY BUT THEY WILL NOT DO IT; FOR WITH LUSTFUL TALK IN THEIR MOUTHS THEY ACT; THEIR HEART IS SET ON THEIR GAIN

AND BEHOLD YOU ARE TO THEM LIKE ONE WHO SINGS LUSTFUL SONGS WITH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND PLAYS WELL ON AN INSTRUMENT FOR THEY HEAR WHAT YOU SAY BUT THEY WILL NOT DO IT

WHEN THIS COMESAND COME IT WILL

THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT A PROPHET HAS BEEN AMONG THEM

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN PROPHESY AGAINST THE SHEPHERDS OF ISRAEL; PROPHESY AND SAY TO THEM EVEN TO THE SHEPHERDS THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD AH SHEPHERDS OF ISRAEL WHO HAVE BEEN FEEDING YOURSELVES

SHOULD NOT SHEPHERDS FEED THE SHEEP

YOU EAT THE FAT YOU CLOTHE YOURSELVES WITH THE WOOL YOU SLAUGHTER THE FAT ONES BUT YOU DO NOT FEED THE SHEEP

THE WEAK YOU HAVE NOT STRENGTHENED THE SICK YOU HAVE NOT HEALED THE INJURED YOU HAVE NOT BOUND UP THE STRAYED YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT BACK THE LOST YOU HAVE NOT SOUGHT AND WITH FORCE AND HARSHNESS YOU HAVE RULED THEM

SO THEY WERE SCATTERED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SHEPHERD AND THEY BECAME FOOD FOR ALL THE WILD BEASTS

MY SHEEP WERE SCATTERED; THEY WANDERED OVER ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND ON EVERY HIGH HILL

MY SHEEP WERE SCATTERED OVER ALL THE FACE OF THE EARTH WITH NONE TO SEARCH OR SEEK FOR THEM

THEREFORE YOU SHEPHERDS HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD SURELY BECAUSE MY SHEEP HAVE BECOME A PREY AND MY SHEEP HAVE BECOME FOOD FOR ALL THE WILD BEASTS SINCE THERE WAS NO SHEPHERD AND BECAUSE MY SHEPHERDS HAVE NOT SEARCHED FOR MY SHEEP BUT THE SHEPHERDS HAVE FED THEMSELVES AND HAVE NOT FED MY SHEEP THEREFORE YOU SHEPHERDS HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I AM AGAINST THE SHEPHERDS AND I WILL REQUIRE MY SHEEP AT THEIR HAND AND PUT A STOP TO THEIR FEEDING THE SHEEP

NO LONGER SHALL THE SHEPHERDS FEED THEMSELVES

I WILL RESCUE MY SHEEP FROM THEIR MOUTHS THAT THEY MAY NOT BE FOOD FOR THEM

FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I I MYSELF WILL SEARCH FOR MY SHEEP AND WILL SEEK THEM OUT

AS A SHEPHERD SEEKS OUT HIS FLOCK WHEN HE IS AMONG HIS SHEEP THAT HAVE BEEN SCATTERED SO WILL I SEEK OUT MY SHEEP AND I WILL RESCUE THEM FROM ALL PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SCATTERED ON A DAY OF CLOUDS AND THICK DARKNESS

AND I WILL BRING THEM OUT FROM THE PEOPLES AND GATHER THEM FROM THE COUNTRIES AND WILL BRING THEM INTO THEIR OWN LAND

AND I WILL FEED THEM ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL BY THE RAVINES AND IN ALL THE INHABITED PLACES OF THE COUNTRY

I WILL FEED THEM WITH GOOD PASTURE AND ON THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHTS OF ISRAEL SHALL BE THEIR GRAZING LAND

THERE THEY SHALL LIE DOWN IN GOOD GRAZING LAND AND ON RICH PASTURE THEY SHALL FEED ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL

I MYSELF WILL BE THE SHEPHERD OF MY SHEEP AND I MYSELF WILL MAKE THEM LIE DOWN DECLARES THE LORD GOD

I WILL SEEK THE LOST AND I WILL BRING BACK THE STRAYED AND I WILL BIND UP THE INJURED AND I WILL STRENGTHEN THE WEAK AND THE FAT AND THE STRONG I WILL DESTROY

I WILL FEED THEM IN JUSTICE

AS FOR YOU MY FLOCK THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I JUDGE BETWEEN SHEEP AND SHEEP BETWEEN RAMS AND MALE GOATS

IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO FEED ON THE GOOD PASTURE THAT YOU MUST TREAD DOWN WITH YOUR FEET THE REST OF YOUR PASTURE; AND TO DRINK OF CLEAR WATER THAT YOU MUST MUDDY THE REST OF THE WATER WITH YOUR FEET

AND MUST MY SHEEP EAT WHAT YOU HAVE TRODDEN WITH YOUR FEET AND DRINK WHAT YOU HAVE MUDDIED WITH YOUR FEET

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO THEM BEHOLD I I MYSELF WILL JUDGE BETWEEN THE FAT SHEEP AND THE LEAN SHEEP

BECAUSE YOU PUSH WITH SIDE AND SHOULDER AND THRUST AT ALL THE WEAK WITH YOUR HORNS TILL YOU HAVE SCATTERED THEM ABROAD I WILL RESCUE MY FLOCK; THEY SHALL NO LONGER BE A PREY

AND I WILL JUDGE BETWEEN SHEEP AND SHEEP

AND I WILL SET UP OVER THEM ONE SHEPHERD MY SERVANT DAVID AND HE SHALL FEED THEM HE SHALL FEED THEM AND BE THEIR SHEPHERD

AND I THE LORD WILL BE THEIR GOD AND MY SERVANT DAVID SHALL BE PRINCE AMONG THEM

I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN

I WILL MAKE WITH THEM A COVENANT OF PEACE AND BANISH WILD BEASTS FROM THE LAND SO THAT THEY MAY DWELL SECURELY IN THE WILDERNESS AND SLEEP IN THE WOODS

AND I WILL MAKE THEM AND THE PLACES ALL AROUND MY HILL A BLESSING AND I WILL SEND DOWN THE SHOWERS IN THEIR SEASON; THEY SHALL BE SHOWERS OF BLESSING

AND THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL YIELD THEIR FRUIT AND THE EARTH SHALL YIELD ITS INCREASE AND THEY SHALL BE SECURE IN THEIR LAND

AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHEN I BREAK THE BARS OF THEIR YOKE AND DELIVER THEM FROM THE HAND OF THOSE WHO ENSLAVED THEM

THEY SHALL NO MORE BE A PREY TO THE NATIONS NOR SHALL THE BEASTS OF THE LAND DEVOUR THEM

THEY SHALL DWELL SECURELY AND NONE SHALL MAKE THEM AFRAID

AND I WILL PROVIDE FOR THEM RENOWNED PLANTATIONS SO THAT THEY SHALL NO MORE BE CONSUMED WITH HUNGER IN THE LAND AND NO LONGER SUFFER THE REPROACH OF THE NATIONS

AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD WITH THEM AND THAT THEY THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ARE MY PEOPLE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND YOU ARE MY SHEEP HUMAN SHEEP OF MY PASTURE AND I AM YOUR GOD DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN SET YOUR FACE AGAINST MOUNT SEIR AND PROPHESY AGAINST IT AND SAY TO IT THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I AM AGAINST YOU MOUNT SEIR AND I WILL STRETCH OUT MY HAND AGAINST YOU AND I WILL MAKE YOU A DESOLATION AND A WASTE

I WILL LAY YOUR CITIES WASTE AND YOU SHALL BECOME A DESOLATION AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

BECAUSE YOU CHERISHED PERPETUAL ENMITY AND GAVE OVER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO THE POWER OF THE SWORD AT THE TIME OF THEIR CALAMITY AT THE TIME OF THEIR FINAL PUNISHMENT THEREFORE AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD I WILL PREPARE YOU FOR BLOOD AND BLOOD SHALL PURSUE YOU; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT HATE BLOODSHED THEREFORE BLOOD SHALL PURSUE YOU

I WILL MAKE MOUNT SEIR A WASTE AND A DESOLATION AND I WILL CUT OFF FROM IT ALL WHO COME AND GO

AND I WILL FILL ITS MOUNTAINS WITH THE SLAIN

ON YOUR HILLS AND IN YOUR VALLEYS AND IN ALL YOUR RAVINES THOSE SLAIN WITH THE SWORD SHALL FALL

I WILL MAKE YOU A PERPETUAL DESOLATION AND YOUR CITIES SHALL NOT BE INHABITED

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

BECAUSE YOU SAID 'THESE TWO NATIONS AND THESE TWO COUNTRIES SHALL BE MINE AND WE WILL TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM'ALTHOUGH THE LORD WAS THERE THEREFORE AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD GOD I WILL DEAL WITH YOU ACCORDING TO THE ANGER AND ENVY THAT YOU SHOWED BECAUSE OF YOUR HATRED AGAINST THEM

AND I WILL MAKE MYSELF KNOWN AMONG THEM WHEN I JUDGE YOU

AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

I HAVE HEARD ALL THE REVILINGS THAT YOU UTTERED AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL SAYING 'THEY ARE LAID DESOLATE; THEY ARE GIVEN US TO DEVOUR

' AND YOU MAGNIFIED YOURSELVES AGAINST ME WITH YOUR MOUTH AND MULTIPLIED YOUR WORDS AGAINST ME; I HEARD IT

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD WHILE THE WHOLE EARTH REJOICES I WILL MAKE YOU DESOLATE

AS YOU REJOICED OVER THE INHERITANCE OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE IT WAS DESOLATE SO I WILL DEAL WITH YOU; YOU SHALL BE DESOLATE MOUNT SEIR AND ALL EDOM ALL OF IT

THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

AND YOU SON OF MAN PROPHESY TO THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL AND SAY O MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE THE ENEMY SAID OF YOU 'AHA

' AND 'THE ANCIENT HEIGHTS HAVE BECOME OUR POSSESSION' THEREFORE PROPHESY AND SAY THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY MADE YOU DESOLATE AND CRUSHED YOU FROM ALL SIDES SO THAT YOU BECAME THE POSSESSION OF THE REST OF THE NATIONS AND YOU BECAME THE TALK AND EVIL GOSSIP OF THE PEOPLE THEREFORE O MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD GOD THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE HILLS THE RAVINES AND THE VALLEYS THE DESOLATE WASTES AND THE DESERTED CITIES WHICH HAVE BECOME A PREY AND DERISION TO THE REST OF THE NATIONS ALL AROUND THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD SURELY I HAVE SPOKEN IN MY HOT JEALOUSY AGAINST THE REST OF THE NATIONS AND AGAINST ALL EDOM WHO GAVE MY LAND TO THEMSELVES AS A POSSESSION WITH WHOLEHEARTED JOY AND UTTER CONTEMPT THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE ITS PASTURELANDS A PREY

THEREFORE PROPHESY CONCERNING THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS TO THE RAVINES AND VALLEYS THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I HAVE SPOKEN IN MY JEALOUS WRATH BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUFFERED THE REPROACH OF THE NATIONS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD I SWEAR THAT THE NATIONS THAT ARE ALL AROUND YOU SHALL THEMSELVES SUFFER REPROACH

BUT YOU O MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL SHALL SHOOT FORTH YOUR BRANCHES AND YIELD YOUR FRUIT TO MY PEOPLE ISRAEL FOR THEY WILL SOON COME HOME

FOR BEHOLD I AM FOR YOU AND I WILL TURN TO YOU AND YOU SHALL BE TILLED AND SOWN

AND I WILL MULTIPLY PEOPLE ON YOU THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ALL OF IT

THE CITIES SHALL BE INHABITED AND THE WASTE PLACES REBUILT

AND I WILL MULTIPLY ON YOU MAN AND BEAST AND THEY SHALL MULTIPLY AND BE FRUITFUL

AND I WILL CAUSE YOU TO BE INHABITED AS IN YOUR FORMER TIMES AND WILL DO MORE GOOD TO YOU THAN EVER BEFORE

THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

I WILL LET PEOPLE WALK ON YOU EVEN MY PEOPLE ISRAEL

AND THEY SHALL POSSESS YOU AND YOU SHALL BE THEIR INHERITANCE AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER BEREAVE THEM OF CHILDREN

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BECAUSE THEY SAY TO YOU 'YOU DEVOUR PEOPLE AND YOU BEREAVE YOUR NATION OF CHILDREN' THEREFORE YOU SHALL NO LONGER DEVOUR PEOPLE AND NO LONGER BEREAVE YOUR NATION OF CHILDREN DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AND I WILL NOT LET YOU HEAR ANYMORE THE REPROACH OF THE NATIONS AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER BEAR THE DISGRACE OF THE PEOPLES AND NO LONGER CAUSE YOUR NATION TO STUMBLE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN WHEN THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL LIVED IN THEIR OWN LAND THEY DEFILED IT BY THEIR WAYS AND THEIR DEEDS

THEIR WAYS BEFORE ME WERE LIKE THE UNCLEANNESS OF A WOMAN IN HER MENSTRUAL IMPURITY

SO I POURED OUT MY WRATH UPON THEM FOR THE BLOOD THAT THEY HAD SHED IN THE LAND FOR THE IDOLS WITH WHICH THEY HAD DEFILED IT

I SCATTERED THEM AMONG THE NATIONS AND THEY WERE DISPERSED THROUGH THE COUNTRIES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR WAYS AND THEIR DEEDS I JUDGED THEM

BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE NATIONS WHEREVER THEY CAME THEY PROFANED MY HOLY NAME IN THAT PEOPLE SAID OF THEM 'THESE ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD AND YET THEY HAD TO GO OUT OF HIS LAND

' BUT I HAD CONCERN FOR MY HOLY NAME WHICH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL HAD PROFANED AMONG THE NATIONS TO WHICH THEY CAME

THEREFORE SAY TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE O HOUSE OF ISRAEL THAT I AM ABOUT TO ACT BUT FOR THE SAKE OF MY HOLY NAME WHICH YOU HAVE PROFANED AMONG THE NATIONS TO WHICH YOU CAME

AND I WILL VINDICATE THE HOLINESS OF MY GREAT NAME WHICH HAS BEEN PROFANED AMONG THE NATIONS AND WHICH YOU HAVE PROFANED AMONG THEM

AND THE NATIONS WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD DECLARES THE LORD GOD WHEN THROUGH YOU I VINDICATE MY HOLINESS BEFORE THEIR EYES

I WILL TAKE YOU FROM THE NATIONS AND GATHER YOU FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES AND BRING YOU INTO YOUR OWN LAND

I WILL SPRINKLE CLEAN WATER ON YOU AND YOU SHALL BE CLEAN FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS I WILL CLEANSE YOU

AND I WILL GIVE YOU A NEW HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT I WILL PUT WITHIN YOU

AND I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH

AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU AND CAUSE YOU TO WALK IN MY STATUTES AND BE CAREFUL TO OBEY MY RULES

YOU SHALL DWELL IN THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO YOUR FATHERS AND YOU SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE YOUR GOD

AND I WILL DELIVER YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES

AND I WILL SUMMON THE GRAIN AND MAKE IT ABUNDANT AND LAY NO FAMINE UPON YOU

I WILL MAKE THE FRUIT OF THE TREE AND THE INCREASE OF THE FIELD ABUNDANT THAT YOU MAY NEVER AGAIN SUFFER THE DISGRACE OF FAMINE AMONG THE NATIONS

THEN YOU WILL REMEMBER YOUR EVIL WAYS AND YOUR DEEDS THAT WERE NOT GOOD AND YOU WILL LOATHE YOURSELVES FOR YOUR INIQUITIES AND YOUR ABOMINATIONS

IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I WILL ACT DECLARES THE LORD GOD; LET THAT BE KNOWN TO YOU

BE ASHAMED AND CONFOUNDED FOR YOUR WAYS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD ON THE DAY THAT I CLEANSE YOU FROM ALL YOUR INIQUITIES I WILL CAUSE THE CITIES TO BE INHABITED AND THE WASTE PLACES SHALL BE REBUILT

AND THE LAND THAT WAS DESOLATE SHALL BE TILLED INSTEAD OF BEING THE DESOLATION THAT IT WAS IN THE SIGHT OF ALL WHO PASSED BY

AND THEY WILL SAY 'THIS LAND THAT WAS DESOLATE HAS BECOME LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND THE WASTE AND DESOLATE AND RUINED CITIES ARE NOW FORTIFIED AND INHABITED

' THEN THE NATIONS THAT ARE LEFT ALL AROUND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; I HAVE REBUILT THE RUINED PLACES AND REPLANTED THAT WHICH WAS DESOLATE

I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN AND I WILL DO IT

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THIS ALSO I WILL LET THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ASK ME TO DO FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK

LIKE THE FLOCK FOR SACRIFICES LIKE THE FLOCK AT JERUSALEM DURING HER APPOINTED FEASTS SO SHALL THE WASTE CITIES BE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF PEOPLE

THEN THEY WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS UPON ME AND HE BROUGHT ME OUT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD AND SET ME DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY; IT WAS FULL OF BONES

AND HE LED ME AROUND AMONG THEM AND BEHOLD THERE WERE VERY MANY ON THE SURFACE OF THE VALLEY AND BEHOLD THEY WERE VERY DRY

AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN CAN THESE BONES LIVE

 AND I ANSWERED O LORD GOD YOU KNOW

 THEN HE SAID TO ME PROPHESY OVER THESE BONES AND SAY TO THEM O DRY BONES HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD

THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO THESE BONES BEHOLD I WILL CAUSE BREATH TO ENTER YOU AND YOU SHALL LIVE

AND I WILL LAY SINEWS UPON YOU AND WILL CAUSE FLESH TO COME UPON YOU AND COVER YOU WITH SKIN AND PUT BREATH IN YOU AND YOU SHALL LIVE AND YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD

 SO I PROPHESIED AS I WAS COMMANDED

AND AS I PROPHESIED THERE WAS A SOUND AND BEHOLD A RATTLING AND THE BONES CAME TOGETHER BONE TO ITS BONE

AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD THERE WERE SINEWS ON THEM AND FLESH HAD COME UPON THEM AND SKIN HAD COVERED THEM

BUT THERE WAS NO BREATH IN THEM

THEN HE SAID TO ME PROPHESY TO THE BREATH; PROPHESY SON OF MAN AND SAY TO THE BREATH THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD COME FROM THE FOUR WINDS O BREATH AND BREATHE ON THESE SLAIN THAT THEY MAY LIVE

 SO I PROPHESIED AS HE COMMANDED ME AND THE BREATH CAME INTO THEM AND THEY LIVED AND STOOD ON THEIR FEET AN EXCEEDINGLY GREAT ARMY

THEN HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN THESE BONES ARE THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

BEHOLD THEY SAY 'OUR BONES ARE DRIED UP AND OUR HOPE IS LOST; WE ARE CLEAN CUT OFF

' THEREFORE PROPHESY AND SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL OPEN YOUR GRAVES AND RAISE YOU FROM YOUR GRAVES O MY PEOPLE

THEN YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD; I HAVE SPOKEN AND I WILL DO IT DECLARES THE LORD

 THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ME SON OF MAN TAKE A STICK AND WRITE ON IT 'FOR JUDAH AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ASSOCIATED WITH HIM'; THEN TAKE ANOTHER STICK AND WRITE ON IT 'FOR JOSEPH THE STICK OF EPHRAIM AND ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL ASSOCIATED WITH HIM

' AND JOIN THEM ONE TO ANOTHER INTO ONE STICK THAT THEY MAY BECOME ONE IN YOUR HAND

AND WHEN YOUR PEOPLE SAY TO YOU 'WILL YOU NOT TELL US WHAT YOU MEAN BY THESE

' SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I AM ABOUT TO TAKE THE STICK OF JOSEPH THAT IS IN THE HAND OF EPHRAIM AND THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL ASSOCIATED WITH HIM

AND I WILL JOIN WITH IT THE STICK OF JUDAH AND MAKE THEM ONE STICK THAT THEY MAY BE ONE IN MY HAND

WHEN THE STICKS ON WHICH YOU WRITE ARE IN YOUR HAND BEFORE THEIR EYES THEN SAY TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD BEHOLD I WILL TAKE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM THE NATIONS AMONG WHICH THEY HAVE GONE AND WILL GATHER THEM FROM ALL AROUND AND BRING THEM TO THEIR OWN LAND

AND I WILL MAKE THEM ONE NATION IN THE LAND ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL

AND ONE KING SHALL BE KING OVER THEM ALL AND THEY SHALL BE NO LONGER TWO NATIONS AND NO LONGER DIVIDED INTO TWO KINGDOMS

THEY SHALL NOT DEFILE THEMSELVES ANYMORE WITH THEIR IDOLS AND THEIR DETESTABLE THINGS OR WITH ANY OF THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS

BUT I WILL SAVE THEM FROM ALL THE BACKSLIDINGS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SINNED AND WILL CLEANSE THEM; AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD

MY SERVANT DAVID SHALL BE KING OVER THEM AND THEY SHALL ALL HAVE ONE SHEPHERD

THEY SHALL WALK IN MY RULES AND BE CAREFUL TO OBEY MY STATUTES

THEY SHALL DWELL IN THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO MY SERVANT JACOB WHERE YOUR FATHERS LIVED

THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN SHALL DWELL THERE FOREVER AND DAVID MY SERVANT SHALL BE THEIR PRINCE FOREVER

I WILL MAKE A COVENANT OF PEACE WITH THEM

IT SHALL BE AN EVERLASTING COVENANT WITH THEM

AND I WILL SET THEM IN THEIR LAND AND MULTIPLY THEM AND WILL SET MY SANCTUARY IN THEIR MIDST FOREVERMORE

MY DWELLING PLACE SHALL BE WITH THEM AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE

THEN THE NATIONS WILL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD WHO SANCTIFIES ISRAEL WHEN MY SANCTUARY IS IN THEIR MIDST FOREVERMORE

AND THE MOUNTAINS SHALL BE THROWN DOWN AND THE CLIFFS SHALL FALL AND EVERY WALL SHALL TUMBLE TO THE GROUND

I WILL SUMMON A SWORD AGAINST GOG ON ALL MY MOUNTAINS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

EVERY MAN'S SWORD WILL BE AGAINST HIS BROTHER

WITH PESTILENCE AND BLOODSHED I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH HIM AND I WILL RAIN UPON HIM AND HIS HORDES AND THE MANY PEOPLES WHO ARE WITH HIM TORRENTIAL RAINS AND HAILSTONES FIRE AND SULFUR

SO I WILL SHOW MY GREATNESS AND MY HOLINESS AND MAKE MYSELF KNOWN IN THE EYES OF MANY NATIONS

AND MY HOLY NAME I WILL MAKE KNOWN IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND I WILL NOT LET MY HOLY NAME BE PROFANED ANYMORE

AND THE NATIONS SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THE HOLY ONE IN ISRAEL

BEHOLD IT IS COMING AND IT WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THAT IS THE DAY OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN

THEN THOSE WHO DWELL IN THE CITIES OF ISRAEL WILL GO OUT AND MAKE FIRES OF THE WEAPONS AND BURN THEM SHIELDS AND BUCKLERS BOW AND ARROWS CLUBS AND SPEARS; AND THEY WILL MAKE FIRES OF THEM FOR SEVEN YEARS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT NEED TO TAKE WOOD OUT OF THE FIELD OR CUT DOWN ANY OUT OF THE FORESTS FOR THEY WILL MAKE THEIR FIRES OF THE WEAPONS

THEY WILL SEIZE THE SPOIL OF THOSE WHO DESPOILED THEM AND PLUNDER THOSE WHO PLUNDERED THEM DECLARES THE LORD GOD

ON THAT DAY I WILL GIVE TO GOG A PLACE FOR BURIAL IN ISRAEL THE VALLEY OF THE TRAVELERS EAST OF THE SEA

IT WILL BLOCK THE TRAVELERS FOR THERE GOG AND ALL HIS MULTITUDE WILL BE BURIED

IT WILL BE CALLED THE VALLEY OF HAMONGOG

FOR SEVEN MONTHS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WILL BE BURYING THEM IN ORDER TO CLEANSE THE LAND

ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WILL BURY THEM AND IT WILL BRING THEM RENOWN ON THE DAY THAT I SHOW MY GLORY DECLARES THE LORD GOD

AT THE END OF SEVEN MONTHS THEY WILL MAKE THEIR SEARCH

AND WHEN THESE TRAVEL THROUGH THE LAND AND ANYONE SEES A HUMAN BONE THEN HE SHALL SET UP A SIGN BY IT TILL THE BURIERS HAVE BURIED IT IN THE VALLEY OF HAMONGOG

HAMONAH IS ALSO THE NAME OF THE CITY

 THUS SHALL THEY CLEANSE THE LAND

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD SPEAK TO THE BIRDS OF EVERY SORT AND TO ALL BEASTS OF THE FIELD 'ASSEMBLE AND COME GATHER FROM ALL AROUND TO THE SACRIFICIAL FEAST THAT I AM PREPARING FOR YOU A GREAT SACRIFICIAL FEAST ON THE MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL AND YOU SHALL EAT FLESH AND DRINK BLOOD

YOU SHALL EAT THE FLESH OF THE MIGHTY AND DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE PRINCES OF THE EARTHOF RAMS OF LAMBS AND OF HEGOATS OF BULLS ALL OF THEM FAT BEASTS OF BASHAN

AND I WILL SET MY GLORY AMONG THE NATIONS AND ALL THE NATIONS SHALL SEE MY JUDGMENT THAT I HAVE EXECUTED AND MY HAND THAT I HAVE LAID ON THEM

THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD FROM THAT DAY FORWARD

AND THE NATIONS SHALL KNOW THAT THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WENT INTO CAPTIVITY FOR THEIR INIQUITY BECAUSE THEY DEALT SO TREACHEROUSLY WITH ME THAT I HID MY FACE FROM THEM AND GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ADVERSARIES AND THEY ALL FELL BY THE SWORD

I DEALT WITH THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR UNCLEANNESS AND THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS AND HID MY FACE FROM THEM

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD NOW I WILL RESTORE THE FORTUNES OF JACOB AND HAVE MERCY ON THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND I WILL BE JEALOUS FOR MY HOLY NAME

THEY SHALL FORGET THEIR SHAME AND ALL THE TREACHERY THEY HAVE PRACTICED AGAINST ME WHEN THEY DWELL SECURELY IN THEIR LAND WITH NONE TO MAKE THEM AFRAID WHEN I HAVE BROUGHT THEM BACK FROM THE PEOPLES AND GATHERED THEM FROM THEIR ENEMIES' LANDS AND THROUGH THEM HAVE VINDICATED MY HOLINESS IN THE SIGHT OF MANY NATIONS

THEN THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD BECAUSE I SENT THEM INTO EXILE AMONG THE NATIONS AND THEN ASSEMBLED THEM INTO THEIR OWN LAND

I WILL LEAVE NONE OF THEM REMAINING AMONG THE NATIONS ANYMORE

AND I WILL NOT HIDE MY FACE ANYMORE FROM THEM WHEN I POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL DECLARES THE LORD GOD

IN THE TWENTYFIFTH YEAR OF OUR EXILE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR AFTER THE CITY WAS STRUCK DOWN ON THAT VERY DAY THE HAND OF THE LORD WAS UPON ME AND HE BROUGHT ME TO THE CITY

IN VISIONS OF GOD HE BROUGHT ME TO THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND SET ME DOWN ON A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN ON WHICH WAS A STRUCTURE LIKE A CITY TO THE SOUTH

WHEN HE BROUGHT ME THERE BEHOLD THERE WAS A MAN WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS LIKE BRONZE WITH A LINEN CORD AND A MEASURING REED IN HIS HAND

AND HE WAS STANDING IN THE GATEWAY

AND THE MAN SAID TO ME SON OF MAN LOOK WITH YOUR EYES AND HEAR WITH YOUR EARS AND SET YOUR HEART UPON ALL THAT I SHALL SHOW YOU FOR YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT SHOW IT TO YOU

DECLARE ALL THAT YOU SEE TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL

 AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A WALL ALL AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE TEMPLE AREA AND THE LENGTH OF THE MEASURING REED IN THE MAN'S HAND WAS SIX LONG CUBITS EACH BEING A CUBIT AND A HANDBREADTH IN LENGTH

SO HE MEASURED THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL ONE REED; AND THE HEIGHT ONE REED

THEN HE WENT INTO THE GATEWAY FACING EAST GOING UP ITS STEPS AND MEASURED THE THRESHOLD OF THE GATE ONE REED DEEP

AND THE SOUND OF HIS COMING WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF MANY WATERS AND THE EARTH SHONE WITH HIS GLORY

AND THE VISION I SAW WAS JUST LIKE THE VISION THAT I HAD SEEN WHEN HE CAME TO DESTROY THE CITY AND JUST LIKE THE VISION THAT I HAD SEEN BY THE CHEBAR CANAL

AND I FELL ON MY FACE

AS THE GLORY OF THE LORD ENTERED THE TEMPLE BY THE GATE FACING EAST THE SPIRIT LIFTED ME UP AND BROUGHT ME INTO THE INNER COURT; AND BEHOLD THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TEMPLE

WHILE THE MAN WAS STANDING BESIDE ME I HEARD ONE SPEAKING TO ME OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND HE SAID TO ME SON OF MAN THIS IS THE PLACE OF MY THRONE AND THE PLACE OF THE SOLES OF MY FEET WHERE I WILL DWELL IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FOREVER

AND THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SHALL NO MORE DEFILE MY HOLY NAME NEITHER THEY NOR THEIR KINGS BY THEIR WHORING AND BY THE DEAD BODIES OF THEIR KINGS AT THEIR HIGH PLACES BY SETTING THEIR THRESHOLD BY MY THRESHOLD AND THEIR DOORPOSTS BESIDE MY DOORPOSTS WITH ONLY A WALL BETWEEN ME AND THEM

THEY HAVE DEFILED MY HOLY NAME BY THEIR ABOMINATIONS THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED SO I HAVE CONSUMED THEM IN MY ANGER

NOW LET THEM PUT AWAY THEIR WHORING AND THE DEAD BODIES OF THEIR KINGS FAR FROM ME AND I WILL DWELL IN THEIR MIDST FOREVER

AS FOR YOU SON OF MAN DESCRIBE TO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THE TEMPLE THAT THEY MAY BE ASHAMED OF THEIR INIQUITIES; AND THEY SHALL MEASURE THE PLAN

AND WHEREVER THE RIVER GOES EVERY LIVING CREATURE THAT SWARMS WILL LIVE AND THERE WILL BE VERY MANY FISH

FOR THIS WATER GOES THERE THAT THE WATERS OF THE SEA MAY BECOME FRESH; SO EVERYTHING WILL LIVE WHERE THE RIVER GOES

FISHERMEN WILL STAND BESIDE THE SEA

FROM ENGEDI TO ENEGLAIM IT WILL BE A PLACE FOR THE SPREADING OF NETS

ITS FISH WILL BE OF VERY MANY KINDS LIKE THE FISH OF THE GREAT SEA

BUT ITS SWAMPS AND MARSHES WILL NOT BECOME FRESH; THEY ARE TO BE LEFT FOR SALT

AND ON THE BANKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER THERE WILL GROW ALL KINDS OF TREES FOR FOOD

THEIR LEAVES WILL NOT WITHER NOR THEIR FRUIT FAIL BUT THEY WILL BEAR FRESH FRUIT EVERY MONTH BECAUSE THE WATER FOR THEM FLOWS FROM THE SANCTUARY

THEIR FRUIT WILL BE FOR FOOD AND THEIR LEAVES FOR HEALING

 THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD THIS IS THE BOUNDARY BY WHICH YOU SHALL DIVIDE THE LAND FOR INHERITANCE AMONG THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

JOSEPH SHALL HAVE TWO PORTIONS

AND YOU SHALL DIVIDE EQUALLY WHAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO YOUR FATHERS

THIS LAND SHALL FALL TO YOU AS YOUR INHERITANCE

THIS SHALL BE THE BOUNDARY OF THE LAND ON THE NORTH SIDE FROM THE GREAT SEA BY WAY OF HETHLON TO LEBOHAMATH AND ON TO ZEDAD BEROTHAH SIBRAIM WHICH LIES ON THE BORDER BETWEEN DAMASCUS AND HAMATH AS FAR AS HAZERHATTICON WHICH IS ON THE BORDER OF HAURAN

SO THE BOUNDARY SHALL RUN FROM THE SEA TO HAZARENAN WHICH IS ON THE NORTHERN BORDER OF DAMASCUS WITH THE BORDER OF HAMATH TO THE NORTH

THIS SHALL BE THE NORTH SIDE

ON THE EAST SIDE THE BOUNDARY SHALL RUN BETWEEN HAURAN AND DAMASCUS; ALONG THE JORDAN BETWEEN GILEAD AND THE LAND OF ISRAEL; TO THE EASTERN SEA AND AS FAR AS TAMAR

THIS SHALL BE THE EAST SIDE

ON THE SOUTH SIDE IT SHALL RUN FROM TAMAR AS FAR AS THE WATERS OF MERIBAHKADESH FROM THERE ALONG THE BROOK OF EGYPT TO THE GREAT SEA

THIS SHALL BE THE SOUTH SIDE

ON THE WEST SIDE THE GREAT SEA SHALL BE THE BOUNDARY TO A POINT OPPOSITE LEBOHAMATH

THIS SHALL BE THE WEST SIDE

SO YOU SHALL DIVIDE THIS LAND AMONG YOU ACCORDING TO THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

YOU SHALL ALLOT IT AS AN INHERITANCE FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR THE SOJOURNERS WHO RESIDE AMONG YOU AND HAVE HAD CHILDREN AMONG YOU

THEY SHALL BE TO YOU AS NATIVEBORN CHILDREN OF ISRAEL

WITH YOU THEY SHALL BE ALLOTTED AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

IN WHATEVER TRIBE THE SOJOURNER RESIDES THERE YOU SHALL ASSIGN HIM HIS INHERITANCE DECLARES THE LORD GOD

ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF JUDAH FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST SHALL BE THE PORTION WHICH YOU SHALL SET APART  CUBITS IN BREADTH AND IN LENGTH EQUAL TO ONE OF THE TRIBAL PORTIONS FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST WITH THE SANCTUARY IN THE MIDST OF IT

THE PORTION THAT YOU SHALL SET APART FOR THE LORD SHALL BE  CUBITS IN LENGTH AND  IN BREADTH

THIS SHALL BE FOR THE CONSECRATED PRIESTS THE SONS OF ZADOK WHO KEPT MY CHARGE WHO DID NOT GO ASTRAY WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WENT ASTRAY AS THE LEVITES DID

AND IT SHALL BELONG TO THEM AS A SPECIAL PORTION FROM THE HOLY PORTION OF THE LAND A MOST HOLY PLACE ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF THE LEVITES

AND ALONGSIDE THE TERRITORY OF THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES SHALL HAVE AN ALLOTMENT  CUBITS IN LENGTH AND  IN BREADTH

THE WHOLE LENGTH SHALL BE  CUBITS AND THE BREADTH 

THEY SHALL NOT SELL OR EXCHANGE ANY OF IT

THEY SHALL NOT ALIENATE THIS CHOICE PORTION OF THE LAND FOR IT IS HOLY TO THE LORD

THE REMAINDER  CUBITS IN BREADTH AND  IN LENGTH SHALL BE FOR COMMON USE FOR THE CITY FOR DWELLINGS AND FOR OPEN COUNTRY

IN THE MIDST OF IT SHALL BE THE CITY AND THESE SHALL BE ITS MEASUREMENTS THE NORTH SIDE  CUBITS THE SOUTH SIDE  THE EAST SIDE  AND THE WEST SIDE 

AND THE CITY SHALL HAVE OPEN LAND ON THE NORTH  CUBITS ON THE SOUTH  ON THE EAST  AND ON THE WEST 

THE REMAINDER OF THE LENGTH ALONGSIDE THE HOLY PORTION SHALL BE  CUBITS TO THE EAST AND  TO THE WEST AND IT SHALL BE ALONGSIDE THE HOLY PORTION

ITS PRODUCE SHALL BE FOOD FOR THE WORKERS OF THE CITY

AND THE WORKERS OF THE CITY FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL SHALL TILL IT

THE WHOLE PORTION THAT YOU SHALL SET APART SHALL BE  CUBITS SQUARE THAT IS THE HOLY PORTION TOGETHER WITH THE PROPERTY OF THE CITY

WHAT REMAINS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOLY PORTION AND OF THE PROPERTY OF THE CITY SHALL BELONG TO THE PRINCE

EXTENDING FROM THE  CUBITS OF THE HOLY PORTION TO THE EAST BORDER AND WESTWARD FROM THE  CUBITS TO THE WEST BORDER PARALLEL TO THE TRIBAL PORTIONS IT SHALL BELONG TO THE PRINCE

THE HOLY PORTION WITH THE SANCTUARY OF THE TEMPLE SHALL BE IN ITS MIDST

IT SHALL BE SEPARATE FROM THE PROPERTY OF THE LEVITES AND THE PROPERTY OF THE CITY WHICH ARE IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE PRINCE

THE PORTION OF THE PRINCE SHALL LIE BETWEEN THE TERRITORY OF JUDAH AND THE TERRITORY OF BENJAMIN

AS FOR THE REST OF THE TRIBES FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST BENJAMIN ONE PORTION

ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF BENJAMIN FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST SIMEON ONE PORTION

ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF SIMEON FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST ISSACHAR ONE PORTION

ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF ISSACHAR FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST ZEBULUN ONE PORTION

AND ADJOINING THE TERRITORY OF GAD TO THE SOUTH THE BOUNDARY SHALL RUN FROM TAMAR TO THE WATERS OF MERIBAHKADESH FROM THERE ALONG THE BROOK OF EGYPT TO THE GREAT SEA

THIS IS THE LAND THAT YOU SHALL ALLOT AS AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL AND THESE ARE THEIR PORTIONS DECLARES THE LORD GOD

THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CITY SHALL BE  CUBITS

AND THE NAME OF THE CITY FROM THAT TIME ON SHALL BE THE LORD IS THERE

 PETERSIMEON PETER A SERVANT AND APOSTLE OF JESUS CHRISTTO THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A FAITH OF EQUAL STANDING WITH OURS BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF OUR GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST MAY GRACE AND PEACE BE MULTIPLIED TO YOU IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND OF JESUS OUR LORD

HIS DIVINE POWER HAS GRANTED TO US ALL THINGS THAT PERTAIN TO LIFE AND GODLINESS THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM WHO CALLED US TO HIS OWN GLORY AND EXCELLENCE BY WHICH HE HAS GRANTED TO US HIS PRECIOUS AND VERY GREAT PROMISES SO THAT THROUGH THEM YOU MAY BECOME PARTAKERS OF THE DIVINE NATURE HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE CORRUPTION THAT IS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF SINFUL DESIRE

FOR THIS VERY REASON MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR FAITH WITH VIRTUE AND VIRTUE WITH KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE WITH SELFCONTROL AND SELFCONTROL WITH STEADFASTNESS AND STEADFASTNESS WITH GODLINESS AND GODLINESS WITH BROTHERLY AFFECTION AND BROTHERLY AFFECTION WITH LOVE

FOR IF THESE QUALITIES ARE YOURS AND ARE INCREASING THEY KEEP YOU FROM BEING INEFFECTIVE OR UNFRUITFUL IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

FOR WHOEVER LACKS THESE QUALITIES IS SO NEARSIGHTED THAT HE IS BLIND HAVING FORGOTTEN THAT HE WAS CLEANSED FROM HIS FORMER SINS

THEREFORE BROTHERS BE ALL THE MORE DILIGENT TO MAKE YOUR CALLING AND ELECTION SURE FOR IF YOU PRACTICE THESE QUALITIES YOU WILL NEVER FALL

FOR IN THIS WAY THERE WILL BE RICHLY PROVIDED FOR YOU AN ENTRANCE INTO THE ETERNAL KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

THEREFORE I INTEND ALWAYS TO REMIND YOU OF THESE QUALITIES THOUGH YOU KNOW THEM AND ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE TRUTH THAT YOU HAVE

I THINK IT RIGHT AS LONG AS I AM IN THIS BODY TO STIR YOU UP BY WAY OF REMINDER SINCE I KNOW THAT THE PUTTING OFF OF MY BODY WILL BE SOON AS OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST MADE CLEAR TO ME

AND I WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT SO THAT AFTER MY DEPARTURE YOU MAY BE ABLE AT ANY TIME TO RECALL THESE THINGS

FOR WE DID NOT FOLLOW CLEVERLY DEVISED MYTHS WHEN WE MADE KNOWN TO YOU THE POWER AND COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BUT WE WERE EYEWITNESSES OF HIS MAJESTY

FOR WHEN HE RECEIVED HONOR AND GLORY FROM GOD THE FATHER AND THE VOICE WAS BORNE TO HIM BY THE MAJESTIC GLORY THIS IS MY BELOVED SON WITH WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED WE OURSELVES HEARD THIS VERY VOICE BORNE FROM HEAVEN FOR WE WERE WITH HIM ON THE HOLY MOUNTAIN

AND WE HAVE SOMETHING MORE SURE THE PROPHETIC WORD TO WHICH YOU WILL DO WELL TO PAY ATTENTION AS TO A LAMP SHINING IN A DARK PLACE UNTIL THE DAY DAWNS AND THE MORNING STAR RISES IN YOUR HEARTS KNOWING THIS FIRST OF ALL THAT NO PROPHECY OF SCRIPTURE COMES FROM SOMEONE'S OWN INTERPRETATION

FOR NO PROPHECY WAS EVER PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF MAN BUT MEN SPOKE FROM GOD AS THEY WERE CARRIED ALONG BY THE HOLY SPIRIT

BUT FALSE PROPHETS ALSO AROSE AMONG THE PEOPLE JUST AS THERE WILL BE FALSE TEACHERS AMONG YOU WHO WILL SECRETLY BRING IN DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES EVEN DENYING THE MASTER WHO BOUGHT THEM BRINGING UPON THEMSELVES SWIFT DESTRUCTION

AND MANY WILL FOLLOW THEIR SENSUALITY AND BECAUSE OF THEM THE WAY OF TRUTH WILL BE BLASPHEMED

AND IN THEIR GREED THEY WILL EXPLOIT YOU WITH FALSE WORDS

THEIR CONDEMNATION FROM LONG AGO IS NOT IDLE AND THEIR DESTRUCTION IS NOT ASLEEP

FOR IF GOD DID NOT SPARE ANGELS WHEN THEY SINNED BUT CAST THEM INTO HELL AND COMMITTED THEM TO CHAINS OF GLOOMY DARKNESS TO BE KEPT UNTIL THE JUDGMENT; IF HE DID NOT SPARE THE ANCIENT WORLD BUT PRESERVED NOAH A HERALD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH SEVEN OTHERS WHEN HE BROUGHT A FLOOD UPON THE WORLD OF THE UNGODLY; IF BY TURNING THE CITIES OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH TO ASHES HE CONDEMNED THEM TO EXTINCTION MAKING THEM AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNGODLY; AND IF HE RESCUED RIGHTEOUS LOT GREATLY DISTRESSED BY THE SENSUAL CONDUCT OF THE WICKED FOR AS THAT RIGHTEOUS MAN LIVED AMONG THEM DAY AFTER DAY HE WAS TORMENTING HIS RIGHTEOUS SOUL OVER THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS THAT HE SAW AND HEARD; THEN THE LORD KNOWS HOW TO RESCUE THE GODLY FROM TRIALS AND TO KEEP THE UNRIGHTEOUS UNDER PUNISHMENT UNTIL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO INDULGE IN THE LUST OF DEFILING PASSION AND DESPISE AUTHORITY

BOLD AND WILLFUL THEY DO NOT TREMBLE AS THEY BLASPHEME THE GLORIOUS ONES WHEREAS ANGELS THOUGH GREATER IN MIGHT AND POWER DO NOT PRONOUNCE A BLASPHEMOUS JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM BEFORE THE LORD

BUT THESE LIKE IRRATIONAL ANIMALS CREATURES OF INSTINCT BORN TO BE CAUGHT AND DESTROYED BLASPHEMING ABOUT MATTERS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT WILL ALSO BE DESTROYED IN THEIR DESTRUCTION SUFFERING WRONG AS THE WAGE FOR THEIR WRONGDOING

THEY COUNT IT PLEASURE TO REVEL IN THE DAYTIME

THEY ARE BLOTS AND BLEMISHES REVELING IN THEIR DECEPTIONS WHILE THEY FEAST WITH YOU

THEY HAVE EYES FULL OF ADULTERY INSATIABLE FOR SIN

THEY ENTICE UNSTEADY SOULS

THEY HAVE HEARTS TRAINED IN GREED

ACCURSED CHILDREN

FORSAKING THE RIGHT WAY THEY HAVE GONE ASTRAY

THEY HAVE FOLLOWED THE WAY OF BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR WHO LOVED GAIN FROM WRONGDOING BUT WAS REBUKED FOR HIS OWN TRANSGRESSION; A SPEECHLESS DONKEY SPOKE WITH HUMAN VOICE AND RESTRAINED THE PROPHET'S MADNESS

THESE ARE WATERLESS SPRINGS AND MISTS DRIVEN BY A STORM

FOR THEM THE GLOOM OF UTTER DARKNESS HAS BEEN RESERVED

FOR SPEAKING LOUD BOASTS OF FOLLY THEY ENTICE BY SENSUAL PASSIONS OF THE FLESH THOSE WHO ARE BARELY ESCAPING FROM THOSE WHO LIVE IN ERROR

THEY PROMISE THEM FREEDOM BUT THEY THEMSELVES ARE SLAVES OF CORRUPTION

FOR WHATEVER OVERCOMES A PERSON TO THAT HE IS ENSLAVED

FOR IF AFTER THEY HAVE ESCAPED THE DEFILEMENTS OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST THEY ARE AGAIN ENTANGLED IN THEM AND OVERCOME THE LAST STATE HAS BECOME WORSE FOR THEM THAN THE FIRST

FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THEM NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THAN AFTER KNOWING IT TO TURN BACK FROM THE HOLY COMMANDMENT DELIVERED TO THEM

WHAT THE TRUE PROVERB SAYS HAS HAPPENED TO THEM THE DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT AND THE SOW AFTER WASHING HERSELF RETURNS TO WALLOW IN THE MIRE

THIS IS NOW THE SECOND LETTER THAT I AM WRITING TO YOU BELOVED

IN BOTH OF THEM I AM STIRRING UP YOUR SINCERE MIND BY WAY OF REMINDER THAT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THE PREDICTIONS OF THE HOLY PROPHETS AND THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD AND SAVIOR THROUGH YOUR APOSTLES KNOWING THIS FIRST OF ALL THAT SCOFFERS WILL COME IN THE LAST DAYS WITH SCOFFING FOLLOWING THEIR OWN SINFUL DESIRES

THEY WILL SAY WHERE IS THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING

FOR EVER SINCE THE FATHERS FELL ASLEEP ALL THINGS ARE CONTINUING AS THEY WERE FROM THE BEGINNING OF CREATION

 FOR THEY DELIBERATELY OVERLOOK THIS FACT THAT THE HEAVENS EXISTED LONG AGO AND THE EARTH WAS FORMED OUT OF WATER AND THROUGH WATER BY THE WORD OF GOD AND THAT BY MEANS OF THESE THE WORLD THAT THEN EXISTED WAS DELUGED WITH WATER AND PERISHED

BUT BY THE SAME WORD THE HEAVENS AND EARTH THAT NOW EXIST ARE STORED UP FOR FIRE BEING KEPT UNTIL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT AND DESTRUCTION OF THE UNGODLY

BUT DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS ONE FACT BELOVED THAT WITH THE LORD ONE DAY IS AS A THOUSAND YEARS AND A THOUSAND YEARS AS ONE DAY

THE LORD IS NOT SLOW TO FULFILL HIS PROMISE AS SOME COUNT SLOWNESS BUT IS PATIENT TOWARD YOU NOT WISHING THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH BUT THAT ALL SHOULD REACH REPENTANCE

BUT THE DAY OF THE LORD WILL COME LIKE A THIEF AND THEN THE HEAVENS WILL PASS AWAY WITH A ROAR AND THE HEAVENLY BODIES WILL BE BURNED UP AND DISSOLVED AND THE EARTH AND THE WORKS THAT ARE DONE ON IT WILL BE EXPOSED

SINCE ALL THESE THINGS ARE THUS TO BE DISSOLVED WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE OUGHT YOU TO BE IN LIVES OF HOLINESS AND GODLINESS WAITING FOR AND HASTENING THE COMING OF THE DAY OF GOD BECAUSE OF WHICH THE HEAVENS WILL BE SET ON FIRE AND DISSOLVED AND THE HEAVENLY BODIES WILL MELT AS THEY BURN

BUT ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE WE ARE WAITING FOR NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH IN WHICH RIGHTEOUSNESS DWELLS

THEREFORE BELOVED SINCE YOU ARE WAITING FOR THESE BE DILIGENT TO BE FOUND BY HIM WITHOUT SPOT OR BLEMISH AND AT PEACE

AND COUNT THE PATIENCE OF OUR LORD AS SALVATION JUST AS OUR BELOVED BROTHER PAUL ALSO WROTE TO YOU ACCORDING TO THE WISDOM GIVEN HIM AS HE DOES IN ALL HIS LETTERS WHEN HE SPEAKS IN THEM OF THESE MATTERS

THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THEM THAT ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHICH THE IGNORANT AND UNSTABLE TWIST TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION AS THEY DO THE OTHER SCRIPTURES

YOU THEREFORE BELOVED KNOWING THIS BEFOREHAND TAKE CARE THAT YOU ARE NOT CARRIED AWAY WITH THE ERROR OF LAWLESS PEOPLE AND LOSE YOUR OWN STABILITY

BUT GROW IN THE GRACE AND KNOWLEDGE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

TO HIM BE THE GLORY BOTH NOW AND TO THE DAY OF ETERNITY

AMEN

PHILIPPIANSPAUL AND TIMOTHY SERVANTS OF CHRIST JESUSTO ALL THE SAINTS IN CHRIST JESUS WHO ARE AT PHILIPPI WITH THE OVERSEERS AND DEACONS GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

I THANK MY GOD IN ALL MY REMEMBRANCE OF YOU ALWAYS IN EVERY PRAYER OF MINE FOR YOU ALL MAKING MY PRAYER WITH JOY BECAUSE OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN THE GOSPEL FROM THE FIRST DAY UNTIL NOW

AND I AM SURE OF THIS THAT HE WHO BEGAN A GOOD WORK IN YOU WILL BRING IT TO COMPLETION AT THE DAY OF JESUS CHRIST

IT IS RIGHT FOR ME TO FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT YOU ALL BECAUSE I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART FOR YOU ARE ALL PARTAKERS WITH ME OF GRACE BOTH IN MY IMPRISONMENT AND IN THE DEFENSE AND CONFIRMATION OF THE GOSPEL

FOR GOD IS MY WITNESS HOW I YEARN FOR YOU ALL WITH THE AFFECTION OF CHRIST JESUS

AND IT IS MY PRAYER THAT YOUR LOVE MAY ABOUND MORE AND MORE WITH KNOWLEDGE AND ALL DISCERNMENT SO THAT YOU MAY APPROVE WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SO BE PURE AND BLAMELESS FOR THE DAY OF CHRIST FILLED WITH THE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT COMES THROUGH JESUS CHRIST TO THE GLORY AND PRAISE OF GOD

I WANT YOU TO KNOW BROTHERS THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME HAS REALLY SERVED TO ADVANCE THE GOSPEL SO THAT IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE IMPERIAL GUARD AND TO ALL THE REST THAT MY IMPRISONMENT IS FOR CHRIST

AND MOST OF THE BROTHERS HAVING BECOME CONFIDENT IN THE LORD BY MY IMPRISONMENT ARE MUCH MORE BOLD TO SPEAK THE WORD WITHOUT FEAR

SOME INDEED PREACH CHRIST FROM ENVY AND RIVALRY BUT OTHERS FROM GOOD WILL

THE LATTER DO IT OUT OF LOVE KNOWING THAT I AM PUT HERE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE GOSPEL

THE FORMER PROCLAIM CHRIST OUT OF RIVALRY NOT SINCERELY BUT THINKING TO AFFLICT ME IN MY IMPRISONMENT

WHAT THEN

ONLY THAT IN EVERY WAY WHETHER IN PRETENSE OR IN TRUTH CHRIST IS PROCLAIMED AND IN THAT I REJOICE

YES AND I WILL REJOICE FOR I KNOW THAT THROUGH YOUR PRAYERS AND THE HELP OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST THIS WILL TURN OUT FOR MY DELIVERANCE AS IT IS MY EAGER EXPECTATION AND HOPE THAT I WILL NOT BE AT ALL ASHAMED BUT THAT WITH FULL COURAGE NOW AS ALWAYS CHRIST WILL BE HONORED IN MY BODY WHETHER BY LIFE OR BY DEATH

FOR TO ME TO LIVE IS CHRIST AND TO DIE IS GAIN

IF I AM TO LIVE IN THE FLESH THAT MEANS FRUITFUL LABOR FOR ME

YET WHICH I SHALL CHOOSE I CANNOT TELL

I AM HARD PRESSED BETWEEN THE TWO

MY DESIRE IS TO DEPART AND BE WITH CHRIST FOR THAT IS FAR BETTER

BUT TO REMAIN IN THE FLESH IS MORE NECESSARY ON YOUR ACCOUNT

CONVINCED OF THIS I KNOW THAT I WILL REMAIN AND CONTINUE WITH YOU ALL FOR YOUR PROGRESS AND JOY IN THE FAITH SO THAT IN ME YOU MAY HAVE AMPLE CAUSE TO GLORY IN CHRIST JESUS BECAUSE OF MY COMING TO YOU AGAIN

ONLY LET YOUR MANNER OF LIFE BE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST SO THAT WHETHER I COME AND SEE YOU OR AM ABSENT I MAY HEAR OF YOU THAT YOU ARE STANDING FIRM IN ONE SPIRIT WITH ONE MIND STRIVING SIDE BY SIDE FOR THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL AND NOT FRIGHTENED IN ANYTHING BY YOUR OPPONENTS

THIS IS A CLEAR SIGN TO THEM OF THEIR DESTRUCTION BUT OF YOUR SALVATION AND THAT FROM GOD

FOR IT HAS BEEN GRANTED TO YOU THAT FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST YOU SHOULD NOT ONLY BELIEVE IN HIM BUT ALSO SUFFER FOR HIS SAKE ENGAGED IN THE SAME CONFLICT THAT YOU SAW I HAD AND NOW HEAR THAT I STILL HAVE

SO IF THERE IS ANY ENCOURAGEMENT IN CHRIST ANY COMFORT FROM LOVE ANY PARTICIPATION IN THE SPIRIT ANY AFFECTION AND SYMPATHY COMPLETE MY JOY BY BEING OF THE SAME MIND HAVING THE SAME LOVE BEING IN FULL ACCORD AND OF ONE MIND

DO NOTHING FROM RIVALRY OR CONCEIT BUT IN HUMILITY COUNT OTHERS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN YOURSELVES

LET EACH OF YOU LOOK NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN INTERESTS BUT ALSO TO THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS

HAVE THIS MIND AMONG YOURSELVES WHICH IS YOURS IN CHRIST JESUS WHO THOUGH HE WAS IN THE FORM OF GOD DID NOT COUNT EQUALITY WITH GOD A THING TO BE GRASPED BUT MADE HIMSELF NOTHING TAKING THE FORM OF A SERVANT BEING BORN IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN

AND BEING FOUND IN HUMAN FORM HE HUMBLED HIMSELF BY BECOMING OBEDIENT TO THE POINT OF DEATH EVEN DEATH ON A CROSS

THEREFORE GOD HAS HIGHLY EXALTED HIM AND BESTOWED ON HIM THE NAME THAT IS ABOVE EVERY NAME SO THAT AT THE NAME OF JESUS EVERY KNEE SHOULD BOW IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH AND UNDER THE EARTH AND EVERY TONGUE CONFESS THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD TO THE GLORY OF GOD THE FATHER

THEREFORE MY BELOVED AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS OBEYED SO NOW NOT ONLY AS IN MY PRESENCE BUT MUCH MORE IN MY ABSENCE WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING FOR IT IS GOD WHO WORKS IN YOU BOTH TO WILL AND TO WORK FOR HIS GOOD PLEASURE

DO ALL THINGS WITHOUT GRUMBLING OR QUESTIONING THAT YOU MAY BE BLAMELESS AND INNOCENT CHILDREN OF GOD WITHOUT BLEMISH IN THE MIDST OF A CROOKED AND TWISTED GENERATION AMONG WHOM YOU SHINE AS LIGHTS IN THE WORLD HOLDING FAST TO THE WORD OF LIFE SO THAT IN THE DAY OF CHRIST I MAY BE PROUD THAT I DID NOT RUN IN VAIN OR LABOR IN VAIN

EVEN IF I AM TO BE POURED OUT AS A DRINK OFFERING UPON THE SACRIFICIAL OFFERING OF YOUR FAITH I AM GLAD AND REJOICE WITH YOU ALL

LIKEWISE YOU ALSO SHOULD BE GLAD AND REJOICE WITH ME

I HOPE IN THE LORD JESUS TO SEND TIMOTHY TO YOU SOON SO THAT I TOO MAY BE CHEERED BY NEWS OF YOU

FOR I HAVE NO ONE LIKE HIM WHO WILL BE GENUINELY CONCERNED FOR YOUR WELFARE

THEY ALL SEEK THEIR OWN INTERESTS NOT THOSE OF JESUS CHRIST

BUT YOU KNOW TIMOTHY'S PROVEN WORTH HOW AS A SON WITH A FATHER HE HAS SERVED WITH ME IN THE GOSPEL

I HOPE THEREFORE TO SEND HIM JUST AS SOON AS I SEE HOW IT WILL GO WITH ME AND I TRUST IN THE LORD THAT SHORTLY I MYSELF WILL COME ALSO

I HAVE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO SEND TO YOU EPAPHRODITUS MY BROTHER AND FELLOW WORKER AND FELLOW SOLDIER AND YOUR MESSENGER AND MINISTER TO MY NEED FOR HE HAS BEEN LONGING FOR YOU ALL AND HAS BEEN DISTRESSED BECAUSE YOU HEARD THAT HE WAS ILL

INDEED HE WAS ILL NEAR TO DEATH

BUT GOD HAD MERCY ON HIM AND NOT ONLY ON HIM BUT ON ME ALSO LEST I SHOULD HAVE SORROW UPON SORROW

I AM THE MORE EAGER TO SEND HIM THEREFORE THAT YOU MAY REJOICE AT SEEING HIM AGAIN AND THAT I MAY BE LESS ANXIOUS

SO RECEIVE HIM IN THE LORD WITH ALL JOY AND HONOR SUCH MEN FOR HE NEARLY DIED FOR THE WORK OF CHRIST RISKING HIS LIFE TO COMPLETE WHAT WAS LACKING IN YOUR SERVICE TO ME

FINALLY MY BROTHERS REJOICE IN THE LORD

TO WRITE THE SAME THINGS TO YOU IS NO TROUBLE TO ME AND IS SAFE FOR YOU

LOOK OUT FOR THE DOGS LOOK OUT FOR THE EVILDOERS LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO MUTILATE THE FLESH

FOR WE ARE THE REAL CIRCUMCISION WHO WORSHIP BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND GLORY IN CHRIST JESUS AND PUT NO CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH THOUGH I MYSELF HAVE REASON FOR CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH ALSO

IF ANYONE ELSE THINKS HE HAS REASON FOR CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH I HAVE MORE CIRCUMCISED ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL OF THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN A HEBREW OF HEBREWS; AS TO THE LAW A PHARISEE; AS TO ZEAL A PERSECUTOR OF THE CHURCH; AS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS UNDER THE LAW BLAMELESS

BUT WHATEVER GAIN I HAD I COUNTED AS LOSS FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST

INDEED I COUNT EVERYTHING AS LOSS BECAUSE OF THE SURPASSING WORTH OF KNOWING CHRIST JESUS MY LORD

FOR HIS SAKE I HAVE SUFFERED THE LOSS OF ALL THINGS AND COUNT THEM AS RUBBISH IN ORDER THAT I MAY GAIN CHRIST AND BE FOUND IN HIM NOT HAVING A RIGHTEOUSNESS OF MY OWN THAT COMES FROM THE LAW BUT THAT WHICH COMES THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM GOD THAT DEPENDS ON FAITH THAT I MAY KNOW HIM AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION AND MAY SHARE HIS SUFFERINGS BECOMING LIKE HIM IN HIS DEATH THAT BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE I MAY ATTAIN THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD

NOT THAT I HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED THIS OR AM ALREADY PERFECT BUT I PRESS ON TO MAKE IT MY OWN BECAUSE CHRIST JESUS HAS MADE ME HIS OWN

BROTHERS I DO NOT CONSIDER THAT I HAVE MADE IT MY OWN

BUT ONE THING I DO FORGETTING WHAT LIES BEHIND AND STRAINING FORWARD TO WHAT LIES AHEAD I PRESS ON TOWARD THE GOAL FOR THE PRIZE OF THE UPWARD CALL OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS

LET THOSE OF US WHO ARE MATURE THINK THIS WAY AND IF IN ANYTHING YOU THINK OTHERWISE GOD WILL REVEAL THAT ALSO TO YOU

ONLY LET US HOLD TRUE TO WHAT WE HAVE ATTAINED

BROTHERS JOIN IN IMITATING ME AND KEEP YOUR EYES ON THOSE WHO WALK ACCORDING TO THE EXAMPLE YOU HAVE IN US

FOR MANY OF WHOM I HAVE OFTEN TOLD YOU AND NOW TELL YOU EVEN WITH TEARS WALK AS ENEMIES OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST

THEIR END IS DESTRUCTION THEIR GOD IS THEIR BELLY AND THEY GLORY IN THEIR SHAME WITH MINDS SET ON EARTHLY THINGS

BUT OUR CITIZENSHIP IS IN HEAVEN AND FROM IT WE AWAIT A SAVIOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO WILL TRANSFORM OUR LOWLY BODY TO BE LIKE HIS GLORIOUS BODY BY THE POWER THAT ENABLES HIM EVEN TO SUBJECT ALL THINGS TO HIMSELF

THEREFORE MY BROTHERS WHOM I LOVE AND LONG FOR MY JOY AND CROWN STAND FIRM THUS IN THE LORD MY BELOVED

I ENTREAT EUODIA AND I ENTREAT SYNTYCHE TO AGREE IN THE LORD

YES I ASK YOU ALSO TRUE COMPANION HELP THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE LABORED SIDE BY SIDE WITH ME IN THE GOSPEL TOGETHER WITH CLEMENT AND THE REST OF MY FELLOW WORKERS WHOSE NAMES ARE IN THE BOOK OF LIFE

REJOICE IN THE LORD ALWAYS; AGAIN I WILL SAY REJOICE

LET YOUR REASONABLENESS BE KNOWN TO EVERYONE

THE LORD IS AT HAND; DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING BUT IN EVERYTHING BY PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION WITH THANKSGIVING LET YOUR REQUESTS BE MADE KNOWN TO GOD

AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH SURPASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING WILL GUARD YOUR HEARTS AND YOUR MINDS IN CHRIST JESUS

FINALLY BROTHERS WHATEVER IS TRUE WHATEVER IS HONORABLE WHATEVER IS JUST WHATEVER IS PURE WHATEVER IS LOVELY WHATEVER IS COMMENDABLE IF THERE IS ANY EXCELLENCE IF THERE IS ANYTHING WORTHY OF PRAISE THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS

WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED AND RECEIVED AND HEARD AND SEEN IN MEPRACTICE THESE THINGS AND THE GOD OF PEACE WILL BE WITH YOU

I REJOICED IN THE LORD GREATLY THAT NOW AT LENGTH YOU HAVE REVIVED YOUR CONCERN FOR ME

YOU WERE INDEED CONCERNED FOR ME BUT YOU HAD NO OPPORTUNITY

NOT THAT I AM SPEAKING OF BEING IN NEED FOR I HAVE LEARNED IN WHATEVER SITUATION I AM TO BE CONTENT

I KNOW HOW TO BE BROUGHT LOW AND I KNOW HOW TO ABOUND

IN ANY AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE I HAVE LEARNED THE SECRET OF FACING PLENTY AND HUNGER ABUNDANCE AND NEED

I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH HIM WHO STRENGTHENS ME

YET IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO SHARE MY TROUBLE

AND YOU PHILIPPIANS YOURSELVES KNOW THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL WHEN I LEFT MACEDONIA NO CHURCH ENTERED INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME IN GIVING AND RECEIVING EXCEPT YOU ONLY

EVEN IN THESSALONICA YOU SENT ME HELP FOR MY NEEDS ONCE AND AGAIN

NOT THAT I SEEK THE GIFT BUT I SEEK THE FRUIT THAT INCREASES TO YOUR CREDIT

I HAVE RECEIVED FULL PAYMENT AND MORE

I AM WELL SUPPLIED HAVING RECEIVED FROM EPAPHRODITUS THE GIFTS YOU SENT A FRAGRANT OFFERING A SACRIFICE ACCEPTABLE AND PLEASING TO GOD

AND MY GOD WILL SUPPLY EVERY NEED OF YOURS ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY IN CHRIST JESUS

TO OUR GOD AND FATHER BE GLORY FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

THIS WAS THE DEDICATION OFFERING FOR THE ALTAR AFTER IT WAS ANOINTED

AND WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH THE LORD HE HEARD THE VOICE SPEAKING TO HIM FROM ABOVE THE MERCY SEAT THAT WAS ON THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY FROM BETWEEN THE TWO CHERUBIM; AND IT SPOKE TO HIM

NOW THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO AARON AND SAY TO HIM WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS THE SEVEN LAMPS SHALL GIVE LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LAMPSTAND

 AND AARON DID SO HE SET UP ITS LAMPS IN FRONT OF THE LAMPSTAND AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

AND THIS WAS THE WORKMANSHIP OF THE LAMPSTAND HAMMERED WORK OF GOLD

FROM ITS BASE TO ITS FLOWERS IT WAS HAMMERED WORK; ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT THE LORD HAD SHOWN MOSES SO HE MADE THE LAMPSTAND

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING TAKE THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND CLEANSE THEM

THUS YOU SHALL DO TO THEM TO CLEANSE THEM SPRINKLE THE WATER OF PURIFICATION UPON THEM AND LET THEM GO WITH A RAZOR OVER ALL THEIR BODY AND WASH THEIR CLOTHES AND CLEANSE THEMSELVES

THEN LET THEM TAKE A BULL FROM THE HERD AND ITS GRAIN OFFERING OF FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH OIL AND YOU SHALL TAKE ANOTHER BULL FROM THE HERD FOR A SIN OFFERING

AND YOU SHALL BRING THE LEVITES BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

WHEN YOU BRING THE LEVITES BEFORE THE LORD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL LAY THEIR HANDS ON THE LEVITES AND AARON SHALL OFFER THE LEVITES BEFORE THE LORD AS A WAVE OFFERING FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT THEY MAY DO THE SERVICE OF THE LORD

THEN THE LEVITES SHALL LAY THEIR HANDS ON THE HEADS OF THE BULLS AND YOU SHALL OFFER THE ONE FOR A SIN OFFERING AND THE OTHER FOR A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE LEVITES

AND YOU SHALL SET THE LEVITES BEFORE AARON AND HIS SONS AND SHALL OFFER THEM AS A WAVE OFFERING TO THE LORD

THUS YOU SHALL SEPARATE THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE

AND AFTER THAT THE LEVITES SHALL GO IN TO SERVE AT THE TENT OF MEETING WHEN YOU HAVE CLEANSED THEM AND OFFERED THEM AS A WAVE OFFERING

FOR THEY ARE WHOLLY GIVEN TO ME FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

INSTEAD OF ALL WHO OPEN THE WOMB THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL I HAVE TAKEN THEM FOR MYSELF

FOR ALL THE FIRSTBORN AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ARE MINE BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST

ON THE DAY THAT I STRUCK DOWN ALL THE FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT I CONSECRATED THEM FOR MYSELF AND I HAVE TAKEN THE LEVITES INSTEAD OF ALL THE FIRSTBORN AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND I HAVE GIVEN THE LEVITES AS A GIFT TO AARON AND HIS SONS FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO DO THE SERVICE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT THE TENT OF MEETING AND TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT THERE MAY BE NO PLAGUE AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL COME NEAR THE SANCTUARY

 THUS DID MOSES AND AARON AND ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO THE LEVITES

ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES CONCERNING THE LEVITES THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID TO THEM

AND THE LEVITES PURIFIED THEMSELVES FROM SIN AND WASHED THEIR CLOTHES AND AARON OFFERED THEM AS A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD AND AARON MADE ATONEMENT FOR THEM TO CLEANSE THEM

AND AFTER THAT THE LEVITES WENT IN TO DO THEIR SERVICE IN THE TENT OF MEETING BEFORE AARON AND HIS SONS; AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES CONCERNING THE LEVITES SO THEY DID TO THEM

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING THIS APPLIES TO THE LEVITES FROM TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD AND UPWARD THEY SHALL COME TO DO DUTY IN THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

AND FROM THE AGE OF FIFTY YEARS THEY SHALL WITHDRAW FROM THE DUTY OF THE SERVICE AND SERVE NO MORE

THEY MINISTER TO THEIR BROTHERS IN THE TENT OF MEETING BY KEEPING GUARD BUT THEY SHALL DO NO SERVICE

THUS SHALL YOU DO TO THE LEVITES IN ASSIGNING THEIR DUTIES

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THEY HAD COME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT SAYING LET THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL KEEP THE PASSOVER AT ITS APPOINTED TIME

ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THIS MONTH AT TWILIGHT YOU SHALL KEEP IT AT ITS APPOINTED TIME; ACCORDING TO ALL ITS STATUTES AND ALL ITS RULES YOU SHALL KEEP IT

 SO MOSES TOLD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE PASSOVER

AND THEY KEPT THE PASSOVER IN THE FIRST MONTH ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH AT TWILIGHT IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI; ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID

AND THERE WERE CERTAIN MEN WHO WERE UNCLEAN THROUGH TOUCHING A DEAD BODY SO THAT THEY COULD NOT KEEP THE PASSOVER ON THAT DAY AND THEY CAME BEFORE MOSES AND AARON ON THAT DAY

AND THOSE MEN SAID TO HIM WE ARE UNCLEAN THROUGH TOUCHING A DEAD BODY

WHY ARE WE KEPT FROM BRINGING THE LORD'S OFFERING AT ITS APPOINTED TIME AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 AND MOSES SAID TO THEM WAIT THAT I MAY HEAR WHAT THE LORD WILL COMMAND CONCERNING YOU

 THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAYING IF ANY ONE OF YOU OR OF YOUR DESCENDANTS IS UNCLEAN THROUGH TOUCHING A DEAD BODY OR IS ON A LONG JOURNEY HE SHALL STILL KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD

IN THE SECOND MONTH ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY AT TWILIGHT THEY SHALL KEEP IT

THEY SHALL EAT IT WITH UNLEAVENED BREAD AND BITTER HERBS

THEY SHALL LEAVE NONE OF IT UNTIL THE MORNING NOR BREAK ANY OF ITS BONES; ACCORDING TO ALL THE STATUTE FOR THE PASSOVER THEY SHALL KEEP IT

BUT IF ANYONE WHO IS CLEAN AND IS NOT ON A JOURNEY FAILS TO KEEP THE PASSOVER THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE BECAUSE HE DID NOT BRING THE LORD'S OFFERING AT ITS APPOINTED TIME; THAT MAN SHALL BEAR HIS SIN

AND IF A STRANGER SOJOURNS AMONG YOU AND WOULD KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD ACCORDING TO THE STATUTE OF THE PASSOVER AND ACCORDING TO ITS RULE SO SHALL HE DO

YOU SHALL HAVE ONE STATUTE BOTH FOR THE SOJOURNER AND FOR THE NATIVE

 ON THE DAY THAT THE TABERNACLE WAS SET UP THE CLOUD COVERED THE TABERNACLE THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY

AND AT EVENING IT WAS OVER THE TABERNACLE LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF FIRE UNTIL MORNING

SO IT WAS ALWAYS THE CLOUD COVERED IT BY DAY AND THE APPEARANCE OF FIRE BY NIGHT

AND WHENEVER THE CLOUD LIFTED FROM OVER THE TENT AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT AND IN THE PLACE WHERE THE CLOUD SETTLED DOWN THERE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAMPED

AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT AND AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY CAMPED

AS LONG AS THE CLOUD RESTED OVER THE TABERNACLE THEY REMAINED IN CAMP

EVEN WHEN THE CLOUD CONTINUED OVER THE TABERNACLE MANY DAYS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL KEPT THE CHARGE OF THE LORD AND DID NOT SET OUT

SOMETIMES THE CLOUD WAS A FEW DAYS OVER THE TABERNACLE AND ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY REMAINED IN CAMP; THEN ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY SET OUT

AND SOMETIMES THE CLOUD REMAINED FROM EVENING UNTIL MORNING

AND WHEN THE CLOUD LIFTED IN THE MORNING THEY SET OUT OR IF IT CONTINUED FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT WHEN THE CLOUD LIFTED THEY SET OUT

WHETHER IT WAS TWO DAYS OR A MONTH OR A LONGER TIME THAT THE CLOUD CONTINUED OVER THE TABERNACLE ABIDING THERE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL REMAINED IN CAMP AND DID NOT SET OUT BUT WHEN IT LIFTED THEY SET OUT

AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY CAMPED AND AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY SET OUT

THEY KEPT THE CHARGE OF THE LORD AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD BY MOSES

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS

OF HAMMERED WORK YOU SHALL MAKE THEM AND YOU SHALL USE THEM FOR SUMMONING THE CONGREGATION AND FOR BREAKING CAMP

AND WHEN BOTH ARE BLOWN ALL THE CONGREGATION SHALL GATHER THEMSELVES TO YOU AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

BUT IF THEY BLOW ONLY ONE THEN THE CHIEFS THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL SHALL GATHER THEMSELVES TO YOU

WHEN YOU BLOW AN ALARM THE CAMPS THAT ARE ON THE EAST SIDE SHALL SET OUT

AND WHEN YOU BLOW AN ALARM THE SECOND TIME THE CAMPS THAT ARE ON THE SOUTH SIDE SHALL SET OUT

AN ALARM IS TO BE BLOWN WHENEVER THEY ARE TO SET OUT

BUT WHEN THE ASSEMBLY IS TO BE GATHERED TOGETHER YOU SHALL BLOW A LONG BLAST BUT YOU SHALL NOT SOUND AN ALARM

AND THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIESTS SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS

THE TRUMPETS SHALL BE TO YOU FOR A PERPETUAL STATUTE THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS

AND WHEN YOU GO TO WAR IN YOUR LAND AGAINST THE ADVERSARY WHO OPPRESSES YOU THEN YOU SHALL SOUND AN ALARM WITH THE TRUMPETS THAT YOU MAY BE REMEMBERED BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AND YOU SHALL BE SAVED FROM YOUR ENEMIES

ON THE DAY OF YOUR GLADNESS ALSO AND AT YOUR APPOINTED FEASTS AND AT THE BEGINNINGS OF YOUR MONTHS YOU SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS OVER YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND OVER THE SACRIFICES OF YOUR PEACE OFFERINGS

THEY SHALL BE A REMINDER OF YOU BEFORE YOUR GOD I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

 IN THE SECOND YEAR IN THE SECOND MONTH ON THE TWENTIETH DAY OF THE MONTH THE CLOUD LIFTED FROM OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT BY STAGES FROM THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI

AND THE CLOUD SETTLED DOWN IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN

THEY SET OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD BY MOSES

THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH SET OUT FIRST BY THEIR COMPANIES AND OVER THEIR COMPANY WAS NAHSHON THE SON OF AMMINADAB

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISSACHAR WAS NETHANEL THE SON OF ZUAR

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF ZEBULUN WAS ELIAB THE SON OF HELON

AND WHEN THE TABERNACLE WAS TAKEN DOWN THE SONS OF GERSHON AND THE SONS OF MERARI WHO CARRIED THE TABERNACLE SET OUT

AND THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF REUBEN SET OUT BY THEIR COMPANIES AND OVER THEIR COMPANY WAS ELIZUR THE SON OF SHEDEUR

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF SIMEON WAS SHELUMIEL THE SON OF ZURISHADDAI

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF GAD WAS ELIASAPH THE SON OF DEUEL

THEN THE KOHATHITES SET OUT CARRYING THE HOLY THINGS AND THE TABERNACLE WAS SET UP BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL

AND THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF THE PEOPLE OF EPHRAIM SET OUT BY THEIR COMPANIES AND OVER THEIR COMPANY WAS ELISHAMA THE SON OF AMMIHUD

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH WAS GAMALIEL THE SON OF PEDAHZUR

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF BENJAMIN WAS ABIDAN THE SON OF GIDEONI

THEN THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF THE PEOPLE OF DAN ACTING AS THE REAR GUARD OF ALL THE CAMPS SET OUT BY THEIR COMPANIES AND OVER THEIR COMPANY WAS AHIEZER THE SON OF AMMISHADDAI

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF ASHER WAS PAGIEL THE SON OF OCHRAN

AND OVER THE COMPANY OF THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF NAPHTALI WAS AHIRA THE SON OF ENAN

THIS WAS THE ORDER OF MARCH OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BY THEIR COMPANIES WHEN THEY SET OUT

AND MOSES SAID TO HOBAB THE SON OF REUEL THE MIDIANITE MOSES' FATHERINLAW WE ARE SETTING OUT FOR THE PLACE OF WHICH THE LORD SAID 'I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU

' COME WITH US AND WE WILL DO GOOD TO YOU FOR THE LORD HAS PROMISED GOOD TO ISRAEL

 BUT HE SAID TO HIM I WILL NOT GO

I WILL DEPART TO MY OWN LAND AND TO MY KINDRED

 AND HE SAID PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE US FOR YOU KNOW WHERE WE SHOULD CAMP IN THE WILDERNESS AND YOU WILL SERVE AS EYES FOR US

AND IF YOU DO GO WITH US WHATEVER GOOD THE LORD WILL DO TO US THE SAME WILL WE DO TO YOU

 SO THEY SET OUT FROM THE MOUNT OF THE LORD THREE DAYS' JOURNEY

AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM THREE DAYS' JOURNEY TO SEEK OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM

AND THE CLOUD OF THE LORD WAS OVER THEM BY DAY WHENEVER THEY SET OUT FROM THE CAMP

AND WHENEVER THE ARK SET OUT MOSES SAID ARISE O LORD AND LET YOUR ENEMIES BE SCATTERED AND LET THOSE WHO HATE YOU FLEE BEFORE YOU

 AND WHEN IT RESTED HE SAID RETURN O LORD TO THE TEN THOUSAND THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL

AND THE PEOPLE COMPLAINED IN THE HEARING OF THE LORD ABOUT THEIR MISFORTUNES AND WHEN THE LORD HEARD IT HIS ANGER WAS KINDLED AND THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AMONG THEM AND CONSUMED SOME OUTLYING PARTS OF THE CAMP

THEN THE PEOPLE CRIED OUT TO MOSES AND MOSES PRAYED TO THE LORD AND THE FIRE DIED DOWN

SO THE NAME OF THAT PLACE WAS CALLED TABERAH BECAUSE THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AMONG THEM

NOW THE RABBLE THAT WAS AMONG THEM HAD A STRONG CRAVING

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ALSO WEPT AGAIN AND SAID OH THAT WE HAD MEAT TO EAT

WE REMEMBER THE FISH WE ATE IN EGYPT THAT COST NOTHING THE CUCUMBERS THE MELONS THE LEEKS THE ONIONS AND THE GARLIC

BUT NOW OUR STRENGTH IS DRIED UP AND THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL BUT THIS MANNA TO LOOK AT

 NOW THE MANNA WAS LIKE CORIANDER SEED AND ITS APPEARANCE LIKE THAT OF BDELLIUM

THE PEOPLE WENT ABOUT AND GATHERED IT AND GROUND IT IN HANDMILLS OR BEAT IT IN MORTARS AND BOILED IT IN POTS AND MADE CAKES OF IT

AND THE TASTE OF IT WAS LIKE THE TASTE OF CAKES BAKED WITH OIL

WHEN THE DEW FELL UPON THE CAMP IN THE NIGHT THE MANNA FELL WITH IT

MOSES HEARD THE PEOPLE WEEPING THROUGHOUT THEIR CLANS EVERYONE AT THE DOOR OF HIS TENT

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD BLAZED HOTLY AND MOSES WAS DISPLEASED

MOSES SAID TO THE LORD WHY HAVE YOU DEALT ILL WITH YOUR SERVANT

AND WHY HAVE I NOT FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT THAT YOU LAY THE BURDEN OF ALL THIS PEOPLE ON ME

DID I CONCEIVE ALL THIS PEOPLE

DID I GIVE THEM BIRTH THAT YOU SHOULD SAY TO ME 'CARRY THEM IN YOUR BOSOM AS A NURSE CARRIES A NURSING CHILD' TO THE LAND THAT YOU SWORE TO GIVE THEIR FATHERS

WHERE AM I TO GET MEAT TO GIVE TO ALL THIS PEOPLE

FOR THEY WEEP BEFORE ME AND SAY 'GIVE US MEAT THAT WE MAY EAT

' I AM NOT ABLE TO CARRY ALL THIS PEOPLE ALONE; THE BURDEN IS TOO HEAVY FOR ME

IF YOU WILL TREAT ME LIKE THIS KILL ME AT ONCE IF I FIND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT THAT I MAY NOT SEE MY WRETCHEDNESS

 THEN THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GATHER FOR ME SEVENTY MEN OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE AND OFFICERS OVER THEM AND BRING THEM TO THE TENT OF MEETING AND LET THEM TAKE THEIR STAND THERE WITH YOU

AND I WILL COME DOWN AND TALK WITH YOU THERE

AND I WILL TAKE SOME OF THE SPIRIT THAT IS ON YOU AND PUT IT ON THEM AND THEY SHALL BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE PEOPLE WITH YOU SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BEAR IT YOURSELF ALONE

AND SAY TO THE PEOPLE 'CONSECRATE YOURSELVES FOR TOMORROW AND YOU SHALL EAT MEAT FOR YOU HAVE WEPT IN THE HEARING OF THE LORD SAYING WHO WILL GIVE US MEAT TO EAT

FOR IT WAS BETTER FOR US IN EGYPT

 THEREFORE THE LORD WILL GIVE YOU MEAT AND YOU SHALL EAT

YOU SHALL NOT EAT JUST ONE DAY OR TWO DAYS OR FIVE DAYS OR TEN DAYS OR TWENTY DAYS BUT A WHOLE MONTH UNTIL IT COMES OUT AT YOUR NOSTRILS AND BECOMES LOATHSOME TO YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE REJECTED THE LORD WHO IS AMONG YOU AND HAVE WEPT BEFORE HIM SAYING WHY DID WE COME OUT OF EGYPT

' BUT MOSES SAID THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM I AM NUMBER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ON FOOT AND YOU HAVE SAID 'I WILL GIVE THEM MEAT THAT THEY MAY EAT A WHOLE MONTH

' SHALL FLOCKS AND HERDS BE SLAUGHTERED FOR THEM AND BE ENOUGH FOR THEM

OR SHALL ALL THE FISH OF THE SEA BE GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THEM AND BE ENOUGH FOR THEM

 AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES IS THE LORD'S HAND SHORTENED

NOW YOU SHALL SEE WHETHER MY WORD WILL COME TRUE FOR YOU OR NOT

 SO MOSES WENT OUT AND TOLD THE PEOPLE THE WORDS OF THE LORD

AND HE GATHERED SEVENTY MEN OF THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE AND PLACED THEM AROUND THE TENT

THEN THE LORD CAME DOWN IN THE CLOUD AND SPOKE TO HIM AND TOOK SOME OF THE SPIRIT THAT WAS ON HIM AND PUT IT ON THE SEVENTY ELDERS

AND AS SOON AS THE SPIRIT RESTED ON THEM THEY PROPHESIED

BUT THEY DID NOT CONTINUE DOING IT

NOW TWO MEN REMAINED IN THE CAMP ONE NAMED ELDAD AND THE OTHER NAMED MEDAD AND THE SPIRIT RESTED ON THEM

THEY WERE AMONG THOSE REGISTERED BUT THEY HAD NOT GONE OUT TO THE TENT AND SO THEY PROPHESIED IN THE CAMP

AND A YOUNG MAN RAN AND TOLD MOSES ELDAD AND MEDAD ARE PROPHESYING IN THE CAMP

 AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN THE ASSISTANT OF MOSES FROM HIS YOUTH SAID MY LORD MOSES STOP THEM

 BUT MOSES SAID TO HIM ARE YOU JEALOUS FOR MY SAKE

WOULD THAT ALL THE LORD'S PEOPLE WERE PROPHETS THAT THE LORD WOULD PUT HIS SPIRIT ON THEM

 AND MOSES AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL RETURNED TO THE CAMP

THEN A WIND FROM THE LORD SPRANG UP AND IT BROUGHT QUAIL FROM THE SEA AND LET THEM FALL BESIDE THE CAMP ABOUT A DAY'S JOURNEY ON THIS SIDE AND A DAY'S JOURNEY ON THE OTHER SIDE AROUND THE CAMP AND ABOUT TWO CUBITS ABOVE THE GROUND

AND THE PEOPLE ROSE ALL THAT DAY AND ALL NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND GATHERED THE QUAIL

THOSE WHO GATHERED LEAST GATHERED TEN HOMERS

AND THEY SPREAD THEM OUT FOR THEMSELVES ALL AROUND THE CAMP

WHILE THE MEAT WAS YET BETWEEN THEIR TEETH BEFORE IT WAS CONSUMED THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE LORD STRUCK DOWN THE PEOPLE WITH A VERY GREAT PLAGUE

THEREFORE THE NAME OF THAT PLACE WAS CALLED KIBROTHHATTAAVAH BECAUSE THERE THEY BURIED THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE CRAVING

FROM KIBROTHHATTAAVAH THE PEOPLE JOURNEYED TO HAZEROTH AND THEY REMAINED AT HAZEROTH

MIRIAM AND AARON SPOKE AGAINST MOSES BECAUSE OF THE CUSHITE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD MARRIED FOR HE HAD MARRIED A CUSHITE WOMAN

AND THEY SAID HAS THE LORD INDEED SPOKEN ONLY THROUGH MOSES

HAS HE NOT SPOKEN THROUGH US ALSO

 AND THE LORD HEARD IT

NOW THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY MEEK MORE THAN ALL PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

AND SUDDENLY THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND TO AARON AND MIRIAM COME OUT YOU THREE TO THE TENT OF MEETING

 AND THE THREE OF THEM CAME OUT

AND THE LORD CAME DOWN IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD AND STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT AND CALLED AARON AND MIRIAM AND THEY BOTH CAME FORWARD

AND HE SAID HEAR MY WORDS IF THERE IS A PROPHET AMONG YOU I THE LORD MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO HIM IN A VISION; I SPEAK WITH HIM IN A DREAM

NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT MOSES

HE IS FAITHFUL IN ALL MY HOUSE

WITH HIM I SPEAK MOUTH TO MOUTH CLEARLY AND NOT IN RIDDLES AND HE BEHOLDS THE FORM OF THE LORD

WHY THEN WERE YOU NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK AGAINST MY SERVANT MOSES

 AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST THEM AND HE DEPARTED

WHEN THE CLOUD REMOVED FROM OVER THE TENT BEHOLD MIRIAM WAS LEPROUS LIKE SNOW

AND AARON TURNED TOWARD MIRIAM AND BEHOLD SHE WAS LEPROUS

AND AARON SAID TO MOSES OH MY LORD DO NOT PUNISH US BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE FOOLISHLY AND HAVE SINNED

LET HER NOT BE AS ONE DEAD WHOSE FLESH IS HALF EATEN AWAY WHEN HE COMES OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

 AND MOSES CRIED TO THE LORD O GOD PLEASE HEAL HERPLEASE

 BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES IF HER FATHER HAD BUT SPIT IN HER FACE SHOULD SHE NOT BE SHAMED SEVEN DAYS

LET HER BE SHUT OUTSIDE THE CAMP SEVEN DAYS AND AFTER THAT SHE MAY BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN

 SO MIRIAM WAS SHUT OUTSIDE THE CAMP SEVEN DAYS AND THE PEOPLE DID NOT SET OUT ON THE MARCH TILL MIRIAM WAS BROUGHT IN AGAIN

AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE SET OUT FROM HAZEROTH AND CAMPED IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SEND MEN TO SPY OUT THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH I AM GIVING TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

FROM EACH TRIBE OF THEIR FATHERS YOU SHALL SEND A MAN EVERY ONE A CHIEF AMONG THEM

 SO MOSES SENT THEM FROM THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF THE LORD ALL OF THEM MEN WHO WERE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THESE WERE THEIR NAMES FROM THE TRIBE OF REUBEN SHAMMUA THE SON OF ZACCUR; FROM THE TRIBE OF SIMEON SHAPHAT THE SON OF HORI; FROM THE TRIBE OF JUDAH CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH; FROM THE TRIBE OF ISSACHAR IGAL THE SON OF JOSEPH; FROM THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM HOSHEA THE SON OF NUN; FROM THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN PALTI THE SON OF RAPHU; FROM THE TRIBE OF ZEBULUN GADDIEL THE SON OF SODI; FROM THE TRIBE OF JOSEPH THAT IS FROM THE TRIBE OF MANASSEH GADDI THE SON OF SUSI; FROM THE TRIBE OF DAN AMMIEL THE SON OF GEMALLI; FROM THE TRIBE OF ASHER SETHUR THE SON OF MICHAEL; FROM THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI NAHBI THE SON OF VOPHSI; FROM THE TRIBE OF GAD GEUEL THE SON OF MACHI

THESE WERE THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHOM MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND

AND MOSES CALLED HOSHEA THE SON OF NUN JOSHUA

MOSES SENT THEM TO SPY OUT THE LAND OF CANAAN AND SAID TO THEM GO UP INTO THE NEGEB AND GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY AND SEE WHAT THE LAND IS AND WHETHER THE PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN IT ARE STRONG OR WEAK WHETHER THEY ARE FEW OR MANY AND WHETHER THE LAND THAT THEY DWELL IN IS GOOD OR BAD AND WHETHER THE CITIES THAT THEY DWELL IN ARE CAMPS OR STRONGHOLDS AND WHETHER THE LAND IS RICH OR POOR AND WHETHER THERE ARE TREES IN IT OR NOT

BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND BRING SOME OF THE FRUIT OF THE LAND

 NOW THE TIME WAS THE SEASON OF THE FIRST RIPE GRAPES

SO THEY WENT UP AND SPIED OUT THE LAND FROM THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN TO REHOB NEAR LEBOHAMATH

THEY WENT UP INTO THE NEGEB AND CAME TO HEBRON

AHIMAN SHESHAI AND TALMAI THE DESCENDANTS OF ANAK WERE THERE

HEBRON WAS BUILT SEVEN YEARS BEFORE ZOAN IN EGYPT

 AND THEY CAME TO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL AND CUT DOWN FROM THERE A BRANCH WITH A SINGLE CLUSTER OF GRAPES AND THEY CARRIED IT ON A POLE BETWEEN TWO OF THEM; THEY ALSO BROUGHT SOME POMEGRANATES AND FIGS

THAT PLACE WAS CALLED THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL BECAUSE OF THE CLUSTER THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CUT DOWN FROM THERE

AT THE END OF FORTY DAYS THEY RETURNED FROM SPYING OUT THE LAND

AND THEY CAME TO MOSES AND AARON AND TO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN AT KADESH

THEY BROUGHT BACK WORD TO THEM AND TO ALL THE CONGREGATION AND SHOWED THEM THE FRUIT OF THE LAND

AND THEY TOLD HIM WE CAME TO THE LAND TO WHICH YOU SENT US

IT FLOWS WITH MILK AND HONEY AND THIS IS ITS FRUIT

HOWEVER THE PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN THE LAND ARE STRONG AND THE CITIES ARE FORTIFIED AND VERY LARGE

AND BESIDES WE SAW THE DESCENDANTS OF ANAK THERE

THE AMALEKITES DWELL IN THE LAND OF THE NEGEB

THE HITTITES THE JEBUSITES AND THE AMORITES DWELL IN THE HILL COUNTRY

AND THE CANAANITES DWELL BY THE SEA AND ALONG THE JORDAN

 BUT CALEB QUIETED THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES AND SAID LET US GO UP AT ONCE AND OCCUPY IT FOR WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME IT

 THEN THE MEN WHO HAD GONE UP WITH HIM SAID WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GO UP AGAINST THE PEOPLE FOR THEY ARE STRONGER THAN WE ARE

 SO THEY BROUGHT TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL A BAD REPORT OF THE LAND THAT THEY HAD SPIED OUT SAYING THE LAND THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE GONE TO SPY IT OUT IS A LAND THAT DEVOURS ITS INHABITANTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE SAW IN IT ARE OF GREAT HEIGHT

AND THERE WE SAW THE NEPHILIM THE SONS OF ANAK WHO COME FROM THE NEPHILIM AND WE SEEMED TO OURSELVES LIKE GRASSHOPPERS AND SO WE SEEMED TO THEM

THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION RAISED A LOUD CRY AND THE PEOPLE WEPT THAT NIGHT

AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GRUMBLED AGAINST MOSES AND AARON

THE WHOLE CONGREGATION SAID TO THEM WOULD THAT WE HAD DIED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

OR WOULD THAT WE HAD DIED IN THIS WILDERNESS

WHY IS THE LORD BRINGING US INTO THIS LAND TO FALL BY THE SWORD

OUR WIVES AND OUR LITTLE ONES WILL BECOME A PREY

WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR US TO GO BACK TO EGYPT

 AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET US CHOOSE A LEADER AND GO BACK TO EGYPT

 THEN MOSES AND AARON FELL ON THEIR FACES BEFORE ALL THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH WHO WERE AMONG THOSE WHO HAD SPIED OUT THE LAND TORE THEIR CLOTHES AND SAID TO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE LAND WHICH WE PASSED THROUGH TO SPY IT OUT IS AN EXCEEDINGLY GOOD LAND

IF THE LORD DELIGHTS IN US HE WILL BRING US INTO THIS LAND AND GIVE IT TO US A LAND THAT FLOWS WITH MILK AND HONEY

ONLY DO NOT REBEL AGAINST THE LORD

AND DO NOT FEAR THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND FOR THEY ARE BREAD FOR US

THEIR PROTECTION IS REMOVED FROM THEM AND THE LORD IS WITH US; DO NOT FEAR THEM

 THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAID TO STONE THEM WITH STONES

BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED AT THE TENT OF MEETING TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE DESPISE ME

AND HOW LONG WILL THEY NOT BELIEVE IN ME IN SPITE OF ALL THE SIGNS THAT I HAVE DONE AMONG THEM

I WILL STRIKE THEM WITH THE PESTILENCE AND DISINHERIT THEM AND I WILL MAKE OF YOU A NATION GREATER AND MIGHTIER THAN THEY

 BUT MOSES SAID TO THE LORD THEN THE EGYPTIANS WILL HEAR OF IT FOR YOU BROUGHT UP THIS PEOPLE IN YOUR MIGHT FROM AMONG THEM AND THEY WILL TELL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND

THEY HAVE HEARD THAT YOU O LORD ARE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PEOPLE

FOR YOU O LORD ARE SEEN FACE TO FACE AND YOUR CLOUD STANDS OVER THEM AND YOU GO BEFORE THEM IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD BY DAY AND IN A PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT

NOW IF YOU KILL THIS PEOPLE AS ONE MAN THEN THE NATIONS WHO HAVE HEARD YOUR FAME WILL SAY 'IT IS BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND THAT HE SWORE TO GIVE TO THEM THAT HE HAS KILLED THEM IN THE WILDERNESS

' AND NOW PLEASE LET THE POWER OF THE LORD BE GREAT AS YOU HAVE PROMISED SAYING 'THE LORD IS SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE FORGIVING INIQUITY AND TRANSGRESSION BUT HE WILL BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS ON THE CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION

' PLEASE PARDON THE INIQUITY OF THIS PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE GREATNESS OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE JUST AS YOU HAVE FORGIVEN THIS PEOPLE FROM EGYPT UNTIL NOW

 THEN THE LORD SAID I HAVE PARDONED ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD

BUT TRULY AS I LIVE AND AS ALL THE EARTH SHALL BE FILLED WITH THE GLORY OF THE LORD NONE OF THE MEN WHO HAVE SEEN MY GLORY AND MY SIGNS THAT I DID IN EGYPT AND IN THE WILDERNESS AND YET HAVE PUT ME TO THE TEST THESE TEN TIMES AND HAVE NOT OBEYED MY VOICE SHALL SEE THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO THEIR FATHERS

AND NONE OF THOSE WHO DESPISED ME SHALL SEE IT

BUT MY SERVANT CALEB BECAUSE HE HAS A DIFFERENT SPIRIT AND HAS FOLLOWED ME FULLY I WILL BRING INTO THE LAND INTO WHICH HE WENT AND HIS DESCENDANTS SHALL POSSESS IT

NOW SINCE THE AMALEKITES AND THE CANAANITES DWELL IN THE VALLEYS TURN TOMORROW AND SET OUT FOR THE WILDERNESS BY THE WAY TO THE RED SEA

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES AND TO AARON SAYING HOW LONG SHALL THIS WICKED CONGREGATION GRUMBLE AGAINST ME

I HAVE HEARD THE GRUMBLINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH THEY GRUMBLE AGAINST ME

SAY TO THEM 'AS I LIVE DECLARES THE LORD WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IN MY HEARING I WILL DO TO YOU YOUR DEAD BODIES SHALL FALL IN THIS WILDERNESS AND OF ALL YOUR NUMBER LISTED IN THE CENSUS FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD WHO HAVE GRUMBLED AGAINST ME NOT ONE SHALL COME INTO THE LAND WHERE I SWORE THAT I WOULD MAKE YOU DWELL EXCEPT CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN

BUT YOUR LITTLE ONES WHO YOU SAID WOULD BECOME A PREY I WILL BRING IN AND THEY SHALL KNOW THE LAND THAT YOU HAVE REJECTED

BUT AS FOR YOU YOUR DEAD BODIES SHALL FALL IN THIS WILDERNESS

AND YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE SHEPHERDS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS AND SHALL SUFFER FOR YOUR FAITHLESSNESS UNTIL THE LAST OF YOUR DEAD BODIES LIES IN THE WILDERNESS

ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE DAYS IN WHICH YOU SPIED OUT THE LAND FORTY DAYS A YEAR FOR EACH DAY YOU SHALL BEAR YOUR INIQUITY FORTY YEARS AND YOU SHALL KNOW MY DISPLEASURE

' I THE LORD HAVE SPOKEN

SURELY THIS WILL I DO TO ALL THIS WICKED CONGREGATION WHO ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST ME IN THIS WILDERNESS THEY SHALL COME TO A FULL END AND THERE THEY SHALL DIE

 AND THE MEN WHOM MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND WHO RETURNED AND MADE ALL THE CONGREGATION GRUMBLE AGAINST HIM BY BRINGING UP A BAD REPORT ABOUT THE LAND THE MEN WHO BROUGHT UP A BAD REPORT OF THE LANDDIED BY PLAGUE BEFORE THE LORD

OF THOSE MEN WHO WENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND ONLY JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH REMAINED ALIVE

WHEN MOSES TOLD THESE WORDS TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE PEOPLE MOURNED GREATLY

AND THEY ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WENT UP TO THE HEIGHTS OF THE HILL COUNTRY SAYING HERE WE ARE

WE WILL GO UP TO THE PLACE THAT THE LORD HAS PROMISED FOR WE HAVE SINNED

 BUT MOSES SAID WHY NOW ARE YOU TRANSGRESSING THE COMMAND OF THE LORD WHEN THAT WILL NOT SUCCEED

DO NOT GO UP FOR THE LORD IS NOT AMONG YOU LEST YOU BE STRUCK DOWN BEFORE YOUR ENEMIES

FOR THERE THE AMALEKITES AND THE CANAANITES ARE FACING YOU AND YOU SHALL FALL BY THE SWORD

BECAUSE YOU HAVE TURNED BACK FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD THE LORD WILL NOT BE WITH YOU

 BUT THEY PRESUMED TO GO UP TO THE HEIGHTS OF THE HILL COUNTRY ALTHOUGH NEITHER THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD NOR MOSES DEPARTED OUT OF THE CAMP

THEN THE AMALEKITES AND THE CANAANITES WHO LIVED IN THAT HILL COUNTRY CAME DOWN AND DEFEATED THEM AND PURSUED THEM EVEN TO HORMAH

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND YOU ARE TO INHABIT WHICH I AM GIVING YOU AND YOU OFFER TO THE LORD FROM THE HERD OR FROM THE FLOCK A FOOD OFFERING OR A BURNT OFFERING OR A SACRIFICE TO FULFILL A VOW OR AS A FREEWILL OFFERING OR AT YOUR APPOINTED FEASTS TO MAKE A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD THEN HE WHO BRINGS HIS OFFERING SHALL OFFER TO THE LORD A GRAIN OFFERING OF A TENTH OF AN EPHAH OF FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH A QUARTER OF A HIN OF OIL; AND YOU SHALL OFFER WITH THE BURNT OFFERING OR FOR THE SACRIFICE A QUARTER OF A HIN OF WINE FOR THE DRINK OFFERING FOR EACH LAMB

OR FOR A RAM YOU SHALL OFFER FOR A GRAIN OFFERING TWO TENTHS OF AN EPHAH OF FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH A THIRD OF A HIN OF OIL

AND FOR THE DRINK OFFERING YOU SHALL OFFER A THIRD OF A HIN OF WINE A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD

AND WHEN YOU OFFER A BULL AS A BURNT OFFERING OR SACRIFICE TO FULFILL A VOW OR FOR PEACE OFFERINGS TO THE LORD THEN ONE SHALL OFFER WITH THE BULL A GRAIN OFFERING OF THREE TENTHS OF AN EPHAH OF FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH HALF A HIN OF OIL

AND YOU SHALL OFFER FOR THE DRINK OFFERING HALF A HIN OF WINE AS A FOOD OFFERING A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD

THUS IT SHALL BE DONE FOR EACH BULL OR RAM OR FOR EACH LAMB OR YOUNG GOAT

AS MANY AS YOU OFFER SO SHALL YOU DO WITH EACH ONE AS MANY AS THERE ARE

EVERY NATIVE ISRAELITE SHALL DO THESE THINGS IN THIS WAY IN OFFERING A FOOD OFFERING WITH A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD

AND IF A STRANGER IS SOJOURNING WITH YOU OR ANYONE IS LIVING PERMANENTLY AMONG YOU AND HE WISHES TO OFFER A FOOD OFFERING WITH A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD HE SHALL DO AS YOU DO

FOR THE ASSEMBLY THERE SHALL BE ONE STATUTE FOR YOU AND FOR THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS WITH YOU A STATUTE FOREVER THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS

YOU AND THE SOJOURNER SHALL BE ALIKE BEFORE THE LORD

ONE LAW AND ONE RULE SHALL BE FOR YOU AND FOR THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS WITH YOU

 THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND TO WHICH I BRING YOU AND WHEN YOU EAT OF THE BREAD OF THE LAND YOU SHALL PRESENT A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LORD

OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL PRESENT A LOAF AS A CONTRIBUTION; LIKE A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE THRESHING FLOOR SO SHALL YOU PRESENT IT

SOME OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL GIVE TO THE LORD AS A CONTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS

BUT IF YOU SIN UNINTENTIONALLY AND DO NOT OBSERVE ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN TO MOSES ALL THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED YOU BY MOSES FROM THE DAY THAT THE LORD GAVE COMMANDMENT AND ONWARD THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS THEN IF IT WAS DONE UNINTENTIONALLY WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONGREGATION ALL THE CONGREGATION SHALL OFFER ONE BULL FROM THE HERD FOR A BURNT OFFERING A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD WITH ITS GRAIN OFFERING AND ITS DRINK OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE RULE AND ONE MALE GOAT FOR A SIN OFFERING

AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND THEY SHALL BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE IT WAS A MISTAKE AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEIR OFFERING A FOOD OFFERING TO THE LORD AND THEIR SIN OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD FOR THEIR MISTAKE

AND ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE FORGIVEN AND THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS AMONG THEM BECAUSE THE WHOLE POPULATION WAS INVOLVED IN THE MISTAKE

IF ONE PERSON SINS UNINTENTIONALLY HE SHALL OFFER A FEMALE GOAT A YEAR OLD FOR A SIN OFFERING

AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT BEFORE THE LORD FOR THE PERSON WHO MAKES A MISTAKE WHEN HE SINS UNINTENTIONALLY TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM AND HE SHALL BE FORGIVEN

YOU SHALL HAVE ONE LAW FOR HIM WHO DOES ANYTHING UNINTENTIONALLY FOR HIM WHO IS NATIVE AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND FOR THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS AMONG THEM

BUT THE PERSON WHO DOES ANYTHING WITH A HIGH HAND WHETHER HE IS NATIVE OR A SOJOURNER REVILES THE LORD AND THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG HIS PEOPLE

BECAUSE HE HAS DESPISED THE WORD OF THE LORD AND HAS BROKEN HIS COMMANDMENT THAT PERSON SHALL BE UTTERLY CUT OFF; HIS INIQUITY SHALL BE ON HIM

 WHILE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WERE IN THE WILDERNESS THEY FOUND A MAN GATHERING STICKS ON THE SABBATH DAY

AND THOSE WHO FOUND HIM GATHERING STICKS BROUGHT HIM TO MOSES AND AARON AND TO ALL THE CONGREGATION

THEY PUT HIM IN CUSTODY BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE CLEAR WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO HIM

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES THE MAN SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH; ALL THE CONGREGATION SHALL STONE HIM WITH STONES OUTSIDE THE CAMP

 AND ALL THE CONGREGATION BROUGHT HIM OUTSIDE THE CAMP AND STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THE LORD SAID TO MOSES SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND TELL THEM TO MAKE TASSELS ON THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS AND TO PUT A CORD OF BLUE ON THE TASSEL OF EACH CORNER

AND IT SHALL BE A TASSEL FOR YOU TO LOOK AT AND REMEMBER ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD TO DO THEM NOT TO FOLLOW AFTER YOUR OWN HEART AND YOUR OWN EYES WHICH YOU ARE INCLINED TO WHORE AFTER

SO YOU SHALL REMEMBER AND DO ALL MY COMMANDMENTS AND BE HOLY TO YOUR GOD

I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO BE YOUR GOD I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD

NOW KORAH THE SON OF IZHAR SON OF KOHATH SON OF LEVI AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM THE SONS OF ELIAB AND ON THE SON OF PELETH SONS OF REUBEN TOOK MEN

AND THEY ROSE UP BEFORE MOSES WITH A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL  CHIEFS OF THE CONGREGATION CHOSEN FROM THE ASSEMBLY WELLKNOWN MEN

THEY ASSEMBLED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON AND SAID TO THEM YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR

FOR ALL IN THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY EVERY ONE OF THEM AND THE LORD IS AMONG THEM

WHY THEN DO YOU EXALT YOURSELVES ABOVE THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD

 WHEN MOSES HEARD IT HE FELL ON HIS FACE AND HE SAID TO KORAH AND ALL HIS COMPANY IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL SHOW WHO IS HIS AND WHO IS HOLY AND WILL BRING HIM NEAR TO HIM

THE ONE WHOM HE CHOOSES HE WILL BRING NEAR TO HIM

DO THIS TAKE CENSERS KORAH AND ALL HIS COMPANY; PUT FIRE IN THEM AND PUT INCENSE ON THEM BEFORE THE LORD TOMORROW AND THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES SHALL BE THE HOLY ONE

YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR SONS OF LEVI

 AND MOSES SAID TO KORAH HEAR NOW YOU SONS OF LEVI IS IT TOO SMALL A THING FOR YOU THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SEPARATED YOU FROM THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL TO BRING YOU NEAR TO HIMSELF TO DO SERVICE IN THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD AND TO STAND BEFORE THE CONGREGATION TO MINISTER TO THEM AND THAT HE HAS BROUGHT YOU NEAR HIM AND ALL YOUR BROTHERS THE SONS OF LEVI WITH YOU

AND WOULD YOU SEEK THE PRIESTHOOD ALSO

THEREFORE IT IS AGAINST THE LORD THAT YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER

WHAT IS AARON THAT YOU GRUMBLE AGAINST HIM

 AND MOSES SENT TO CALL DATHAN AND ABIRAM THE SONS OF ELIAB AND THEY SAID WE WILL NOT COME UP

IS IT A SMALL THING THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT US UP OUT OF A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY TO KILL US IN THE WILDERNESS THAT YOU MUST ALSO MAKE YOURSELF A PRINCE OVER US

MOREOVER YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT US INTO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY NOR GIVEN US INHERITANCE OF FIELDS AND VINEYARDS

WILL YOU PUT OUT THE EYES OF THESE MEN

WE WILL NOT COME UP

 AND MOSES WAS VERY ANGRY AND SAID TO THE LORD DO NOT RESPECT THEIR OFFERING

I HAVE NOT TAKEN ONE DONKEY FROM THEM AND I HAVE NOT HARMED ONE OF THEM

 AND MOSES SAID TO KORAH BE PRESENT YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY BEFORE THE LORD YOU AND THEY AND AARON TOMORROW

AND LET EVERY ONE OF YOU TAKE HIS CENSER AND PUT INCENSE ON IT AND EVERY ONE OF YOU BRING BEFORE THE LORD HIS CENSER  CENSERS; YOU ALSO AND AARON EACH HIS CENSER

 SO EVERY MAN TOOK HIS CENSER AND PUT FIRE IN THEM AND LAID INCENSE ON THEM AND STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING WITH MOSES AND AARON

THEN KORAH ASSEMBLED ALL THE CONGREGATION AGAINST THEM AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED TO ALL THE CONGREGATION

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES AND TO AARON SAYING SEPARATE YOURSELVES FROM AMONG THIS CONGREGATION THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM IN A MOMENT

 AND THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES AND SAID O GOD THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH SHALL ONE MAN SIN AND WILL YOU BE ANGRY WITH ALL THE CONGREGATION

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SAY TO THE CONGREGATION GET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING OF KORAH DATHAN AND ABIRAM

 THEN MOSES ROSE AND WENT TO DATHAN AND ABIRAM AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL FOLLOWED HIM

AND HE SPOKE TO THE CONGREGATION SAYING DEPART PLEASE FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED MEN AND TOUCH NOTHING OF THEIRS LEST YOU BE SWEPT AWAY WITH ALL THEIR SINS

 SO THEY GOT AWAY FROM THE DWELLING OF KORAH DATHAN AND ABIRAM

AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM CAME OUT AND STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THEIR TENTS TOGETHER WITH THEIR WIVES THEIR SONS AND THEIR LITTLE ONES

AND MOSES SAID HEREBY YOU SHALL KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME TO DO ALL THESE WORKS AND THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN OF MY OWN ACCORD

IF THESE MEN DIE AS ALL MEN DIE OR IF THEY ARE VISITED BY THE FATE OF ALL MANKIND THEN THE LORD HAS NOT SENT ME

BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW AND THE GROUND OPENS ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWS THEM UP WITH ALL THAT BELONGS TO THEM AND THEY GO DOWN ALIVE INTO SHEOL THEN YOU SHALL KNOW THAT THESE MEN HAVE DESPISED THE LORD

 AND AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING ALL THESE WORDS THE GROUND UNDER THEM SPLIT APART

AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM UP WITH THEIR HOUSEHOLDS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO BELONGED TO KORAH AND ALL THEIR GOODS

SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE INTO SHEOL AND THE EARTH CLOSED OVER THEM AND THEY PERISHED FROM THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND ALL ISRAEL WHO WERE AROUND THEM FLED AT THEIR CRY FOR THEY SAID LEST THE EARTH SWALLOW US UP

 AND FIRE CAME OUT FROM THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE  MEN OFFERING THE INCENSE

THEN THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING TELL ELEAZAR THE SON OF AARON THE PRIEST TO TAKE UP THE CENSERS OUT OF THE BLAZE

THEN SCATTER THE FIRE FAR AND WIDE FOR THEY HAVE BECOME HOLY

AS FOR THE CENSERS OF THESE MEN WHO HAVE SINNED AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES LET THEM BE MADE INTO HAMMERED PLATES AS A COVERING FOR THE ALTAR FOR THEY OFFERED THEM BEFORE THE LORD AND THEY BECAME HOLY

THUS THEY SHALL BE A SIGN TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 SO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST TOOK THE BRONZE CENSERS WHICH THOSE WHO WERE BURNED HAD OFFERED AND THEY WERE HAMMERED OUT AS A COVERING FOR THE ALTAR TO BE A REMINDER TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SO THAT NO OUTSIDER WHO IS NOT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF AARON SHOULD DRAW NEAR TO BURN INCENSE BEFORE THE LORD LEST HE BECOME LIKE KORAH AND HIS COMPANYAS THE LORD SAID TO HIM THROUGH MOSES

BUT ON THE NEXT DAY ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GRUMBLED AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON SAYING YOU HAVE KILLED THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD

 AND WHEN THE CONGREGATION HAD ASSEMBLED AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON THEY TURNED TOWARD THE TENT OF MEETING

AND BEHOLD THE CLOUD COVERED IT AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED

AND MOSES AND AARON CAME TO THE FRONT OF THE TENT OF MEETING AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING GET AWAY FROM THE MIDST OF THIS CONGREGATION THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM IN A MOMENT

 AND THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES

AND MOSES SAID TO AARON TAKE YOUR CENSER AND PUT FIRE ON IT FROM OFF THE ALTAR AND LAY INCENSE ON IT AND CARRY IT QUICKLY TO THE CONGREGATION AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THEM FOR WRATH HAS GONE OUT FROM THE LORD; THE PLAGUE HAS BEGUN

 SO AARON TOOK IT AS MOSES SAID AND RAN INTO THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND BEHOLD THE PLAGUE HAD ALREADY BEGUN AMONG THE PEOPLE

AND HE PUT ON THE INCENSE AND MADE ATONEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE

AND HE STOOD BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE LIVING AND THE PLAGUE WAS STOPPED

NOW THOSE WHO DIED IN THE PLAGUE WERE  BESIDES THOSE WHO DIED IN THE AFFAIR OF KORAH

AND AARON RETURNED TO MOSES AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING WHEN THE PLAGUE WAS STOPPED

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND GET FROM THEM STAFFS ONE FOR EACH FATHERS' HOUSE FROM ALL THEIR CHIEFS ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES TWELVE STAFFS

WRITE EACH MAN'S NAME ON HIS STAFF AND WRITE AARON'S NAME ON THE STAFF OF LEVI

FOR THERE SHALL BE ONE STAFF FOR THE HEAD OF EACH FATHERS' HOUSE

THEN YOU SHALL DEPOSIT THEM IN THE TENT OF MEETING BEFORE THE TESTIMONY WHERE I MEET WITH YOU

AND THE STAFF OF THE MAN WHOM I CHOOSE SHALL SPROUT

THUS I WILL MAKE TO CEASE FROM ME THE GRUMBLINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH THEY GRUMBLE AGAINST YOU

 MOSES SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND ALL THEIR CHIEFS GAVE HIM STAFFS ONE FOR EACH CHIEF ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES TWELVE STAFFS

AND THE STAFF OF AARON WAS AMONG THEIR STAFFS

AND MOSES DEPOSITED THE STAFFS BEFORE THE LORD IN THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY

ON THE NEXT DAY MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY AND BEHOLD THE STAFF OF AARON FOR THE HOUSE OF LEVI HAD SPROUTED AND PUT FORTH BUDS AND PRODUCED BLOSSOMS AND IT BORE RIPE ALMONDS

THEN MOSES BROUGHT OUT ALL THE STAFFS FROM BEFORE THE LORD TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THEY LOOKED AND EACH MAN TOOK HIS STAFF

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PUT BACK THE STAFF OF AARON BEFORE THE TESTIMONY TO BE KEPT AS A SIGN FOR THE REBELS THAT YOU MAY MAKE AN END OF THEIR GRUMBLINGS AGAINST ME LEST THEY DIE

 THUS DID MOSES; AS THE LORD COMMANDED HIM SO HE DID

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TO MOSES BEHOLD WE PERISH WE ARE UNDONE WE ARE ALL UNDONE

EVERYONE WHO COMES NEAR WHO COMES NEAR TO THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD SHALL DIE

ARE WE ALL TO PERISH

SO THE LORD SAID TO AARON YOU AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE WITH YOU SHALL BEAR INIQUITY CONNECTED WITH THE SANCTUARY AND YOU AND YOUR SONS WITH YOU SHALL BEAR INIQUITY CONNECTED WITH YOUR PRIESTHOOD

AND WITH YOU BRING YOUR BROTHERS ALSO THE TRIBE OF LEVI THE TRIBE OF YOUR FATHER THAT THEY MAY JOIN YOU AND MINISTER TO YOU WHILE YOU AND YOUR SONS WITH YOU ARE BEFORE THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY

THEY SHALL KEEP GUARD OVER YOU AND OVER THE WHOLE TENT BUT SHALL NOT COME NEAR TO THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY OR TO THE ALTAR LEST THEY AND YOU DIE

THEY SHALL JOIN YOU AND KEEP GUARD OVER THE TENT OF MEETING FOR ALL THE SERVICE OF THE TENT AND NO OUTSIDER SHALL COME NEAR YOU

AND YOU SHALL KEEP GUARD OVER THE SANCTUARY AND OVER THE ALTAR THAT THERE MAY NEVER AGAIN BE WRATH ON THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND BEHOLD I HAVE TAKEN YOUR BROTHERS THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEY ARE A GIFT TO YOU GIVEN TO THE LORD TO DO THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

AND YOU AND YOUR SONS WITH YOU SHALL GUARD YOUR PRIESTHOOD FOR ALL THAT CONCERNS THE ALTAR AND THAT IS WITHIN THE VEIL; AND YOU SHALL SERVE

I GIVE YOUR PRIESTHOOD AS A GIFT AND ANY OUTSIDER WHO COMES NEAR SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

 THEN THE LORD SPOKE TO AARON BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOU CHARGE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO ME ALL THE CONSECRATED THINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

I HAVE GIVEN THEM TO YOU AS A PORTION AND TO YOUR SONS AS A PERPETUAL DUE

THIS SHALL BE YOURS OF THE MOST HOLY THINGS RESERVED FROM THE FIRE EVERY OFFERING OF THEIRS EVERY GRAIN OFFERING OF THEIRS AND EVERY SIN OFFERING OF THEIRS AND EVERY GUILT OFFERING OF THEIRS WHICH THEY RENDER TO ME SHALL BE MOST HOLY TO YOU AND TO YOUR SONS

IN A MOST HOLY PLACE SHALL YOU EAT IT

EVERY MALE MAY EAT IT; IT IS HOLY TO YOU

THIS ALSO IS YOURS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THEIR GIFT ALL THE WAVE OFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

I HAVE GIVEN THEM TO YOU AND TO YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WITH YOU AS A PERPETUAL DUE

EVERYONE WHO IS CLEAN IN YOUR HOUSE MAY EAT IT

ALL THE BEST OF THE OIL AND ALL THE BEST OF THE WINE AND OF THE GRAIN THE FIRSTFRUITS OF WHAT THEY GIVE TO THE LORD I GIVE TO YOU

THE FIRST RIPE FRUITS OF ALL THAT IS IN THEIR LAND WHICH THEY BRING TO THE LORD SHALL BE YOURS

EVERYONE WHO IS CLEAN IN YOUR HOUSE MAY EAT IT

EVERY DEVOTED THING IN ISRAEL SHALL BE YOURS

EVERYTHING THAT OPENS THE WOMB OF ALL FLESH WHETHER MAN OR BEAST WHICH THEY OFFER TO THE LORD SHALL BE YOURS

NEVERTHELESS THE FIRSTBORN OF MAN YOU SHALL REDEEM AND THE FIRSTBORN OF UNCLEAN ANIMALS YOU SHALL REDEEM

AND THEIR REDEMPTION PRICE AT A MONTH OLD YOU SHALL REDEEM THEM YOU SHALL FIX AT FIVE SHEKELS IN SILVER ACCORDING TO THE SHEKEL OF THE SANCTUARY WHICH IS TWENTY GERAHS

BUT THE FIRSTBORN OF A COW OR THE FIRSTBORN OF A SHEEP OR THE FIRSTBORN OF A GOAT YOU SHALL NOT REDEEM; THEY ARE HOLY

YOU SHALL SPRINKLE THEIR BLOOD ON THE ALTAR AND SHALL BURN THEIR FAT AS A FOOD OFFERING WITH A PLEASING AROMA TO THE LORD

BUT THEIR FLESH SHALL BE YOURS AS THE BREAST THAT IS WAVED AND AS THE RIGHT THIGH ARE YOURS

ALL THE HOLY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL PRESENT TO THE LORD I GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WITH YOU AS A PERPETUAL DUE

IT IS A COVENANT OF SALT FOREVER BEFORE THE LORD FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR OFFSPRING WITH YOU

 AND THE LORD SAID TO AARON YOU SHALL HAVE NO INHERITANCE IN THEIR LAND NEITHER SHALL YOU HAVE ANY PORTION AMONG THEM

I AM YOUR PORTION AND YOUR INHERITANCE AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

TO THE LEVITES I HAVE GIVEN EVERY TITHE IN ISRAEL FOR AN INHERITANCE IN RETURN FOR THEIR SERVICE THAT THEY DO THEIR SERVICE IN THE TENT OF MEETING SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DO NOT COME NEAR THE TENT OF MEETING LEST THEY BEAR SIN AND DIE

BUT THE LEVITES SHALL DO THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING AND THEY SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITY

IT SHALL BE A PERPETUAL STATUTE THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS AND AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEY SHALL HAVE NO INHERITANCE

FOR THE TITHE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHICH THEY PRESENT AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LORD I HAVE GIVEN TO THE LEVITES FOR AN INHERITANCE

THEREFORE I HAVE SAID OF THEM THAT THEY SHALL HAVE NO INHERITANCE AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

 AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING MOREOVER YOU SHALL SPEAK AND SAY TO THE LEVITES 'WHEN YOU TAKE FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE TITHE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU FROM THEM FOR YOUR INHERITANCE THEN YOU SHALL PRESENT A CONTRIBUTION FROM IT TO THE LORD A TITHE OF THE TITHE

AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION SHALL BE COUNTED TO YOU AS THOUGH IT WERE THE GRAIN OF THE THRESHING FLOOR AND AS THE FULLNESS OF THE WINEPRESS

SO YOU SHALL ALSO PRESENT A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LORD FROM ALL YOUR TITHES WHICH YOU RECEIVE FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND FROM IT YOU SHALL GIVE THE LORD'S CONTRIBUTION TO AARON THE PRIEST

OUT OF ALL THE GIFTS TO YOU YOU SHALL PRESENT EVERY CONTRIBUTION DUE TO THE LORD; FROM EACH ITS BEST PART IS TO BE DEDICATED

' THEREFORE YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM 'WHEN YOU HAVE OFFERED FROM IT THE BEST OF IT THEN THE REST SHALL BE COUNTED TO THE LEVITES AS PRODUCE OF THE THRESHING FLOOR AND AS PRODUCE OF THE WINEPRESS

AND YOU MAY EAT IT IN ANY PLACE YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLDS FOR IT IS YOUR REWARD IN RETURN FOR YOUR SERVICE IN THE TENT OF MEETING

AND YOU SHALL BEAR NO SIN BY REASON OF IT WHEN YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTED THE BEST OF IT

BUT YOU SHALL NOT PROFANE THE HOLY THINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL LEST YOU DIE

'NOW THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES AND TO AARON SAYING THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE LAW THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED TELL THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO BRING YOU A RED HEIFER WITHOUT DEFECT IN WHICH THERE IS NO BLEMISH AND ON WHICH A YOKE HAS NEVER COME

AND YOU SHALL GIVE IT TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND IT SHALL BE TAKEN OUTSIDE THE CAMP AND SLAUGHTERED BEFORE HIM

AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE SOME OF ITS BLOOD WITH HIS FINGER AND SPRINKLE SOME OF ITS BLOOD TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE TENT OF MEETING SEVEN TIMES

AND THE HEIFER SHALL BE BURNED IN HIS SIGHT

ITS SKIN ITS FLESH AND ITS BLOOD WITH ITS DUNG SHALL BE BURNED

AND THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE CEDARWOOD AND HYSSOP AND SCARLET YARN AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE BURNING THE HEIFER

THEN THE PRIEST SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES AND BATHE HIS BODY IN WATER AND AFTERWARD HE MAY COME INTO THE CAMP

BUT THE PRIEST SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVENING

THE ONE WHO BURNS THE HEIFER SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES IN WATER AND BATHE HIS BODY IN WATER AND SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVENING

AND A MAN WHO IS CLEAN SHALL GATHER UP THE ASHES OF THE HEIFER AND DEPOSIT THEM OUTSIDE THE CAMP IN A CLEAN PLACE

AND THEY SHALL BE KEPT FOR THE WATER FOR IMPURITY FOR THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL; IT IS A SIN OFFERING

AND THE ONE WHO GATHERS THE ASHES OF THE HEIFER SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVENING

AND THIS SHALL BE A PERPETUAL STATUTE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND FOR THE STRANGER WHO SOJOURNS AMONG THEM

WHOEVER TOUCHES THE DEAD BODY OF ANY PERSON SHALL BE UNCLEAN SEVEN DAYS

HE SHALL CLEANSE HIMSELF WITH THE WATER ON THE THIRD DAY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND SO BE CLEAN

BUT IF HE DOES NOT CLEANSE HIMSELF ON THE THIRD DAY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE WILL NOT BECOME CLEAN

WHOEVER TOUCHES A DEAD PERSON THE BODY OF ANYONE WHO HAS DIED AND DOES NOT CLEANSE HIMSELF DEFILES THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD AND THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM ISRAEL; BECAUSE THE WATER FOR IMPURITY WAS NOT THROWN ON HIM HE SHALL BE UNCLEAN

HIS UNCLEANNESS IS STILL ON HIM

THIS IS THE LAW WHEN SOMEONE DIES IN A TENT EVERYONE WHO COMES INTO THE TENT AND EVERYONE WHO IS IN THE TENT SHALL BE UNCLEAN SEVEN DAYS

AND EVERY OPEN VESSEL THAT HAS NO COVER FASTENED ON IT IS UNCLEAN

WHOEVER IN THE OPEN FIELD TOUCHES SOMEONE WHO WAS KILLED WITH A SWORD OR WHO DIED NATURALLY OR TOUCHES A HUMAN BONE OR A GRAVE SHALL BE UNCLEAN SEVEN DAYS

FOR THE UNCLEAN THEY SHALL TAKE SOME ASHES OF THE BURNT SIN OFFERING AND FRESH WATER SHALL BE ADDED IN A VESSEL

THEN A CLEAN PERSON SHALL TAKE HYSSOP AND DIP IT IN THE WATER AND SPRINKLE IT ON THE TENT AND ON ALL THE FURNISHINGS AND ON THE PERSONS WHO WERE THERE AND ON WHOEVER TOUCHED THE BONE OR THE SLAIN OR THE DEAD OR THE GRAVE

AND THE CLEAN PERSON SHALL SPRINKLE IT ON THE UNCLEAN ON THE THIRD DAY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY

THUS ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE SHALL CLEANSE HIM AND HE SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES AND BATHE HIMSELF IN WATER AND AT EVENING HE SHALL BE CLEAN

IF THE MAN WHO IS UNCLEAN DOES NOT CLEANSE HIMSELF THAT PERSON SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY SINCE HE HAS DEFILED THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD

BECAUSE THE WATER FOR IMPURITY HAS NOT BEEN THROWN ON HIM HE IS UNCLEAN

AND IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOREVER FOR THEM

THE ONE WHO SPRINKLES THE WATER FOR IMPURITY SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES AND THE ONE WHO TOUCHES THE WATER FOR IMPURITY SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVENING

AND WHATEVER THE UNCLEAN PERSON TOUCHES SHALL BE UNCLEAN AND ANYONE WHO TOUCHES IT SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVENING

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE WHOLE CONGREGATION CAME INTO THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN IN THE FIRST MONTH AND THE PEOPLE STAYED IN KADESH

AND MIRIAM DIED THERE AND WAS BURIED THERE

NOW THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE CONGREGATION

AND THEY ASSEMBLED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON

AND THE PEOPLE QUARRELED WITH MOSES AND SAID WOULD THAT WE HAD PERISHED WHEN OUR BROTHERS PERISHED BEFORE THE LORD

WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD INTO THIS WILDERNESS THAT WE SHOULD DIE HERE BOTH WE AND OUR CATTLE

AND WHY HAVE YOU MADE US COME UP OUT OF EGYPT TO BRING US TO THIS EVIL PLACE

IT IS NO PLACE FOR GRAIN OR FIGS OR VINES OR POMEGRANATES AND THERE IS NO WATER TO DRINK

 THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE ASSEMBLY TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING AND FELL ON THEIR FACES

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED TO THEM AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING TAKE THE STAFF AND ASSEMBLE THE CONGREGATION YOU AND AARON YOUR BROTHER AND TELL THE ROCK BEFORE THEIR EYES TO YIELD ITS WATER

SO YOU SHALL BRING WATER OUT OF THE ROCK FOR THEM AND GIVE DRINK TO THE CONGREGATION AND THEIR CATTLE

 AND MOSES TOOK THE STAFF FROM BEFORE THE LORD AS HE COMMANDED HIM

THEN MOSES AND AARON GATHERED THE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER BEFORE THE ROCK AND HE SAID TO THEM HEAR NOW YOU REBELS SHALL WE BRING WATER FOR YOU OUT OF THIS ROCK

 AND MOSES LIFTED UP HIS HAND AND STRUCK THE ROCK WITH HIS STAFF TWICE AND WATER CAME OUT ABUNDANTLY AND THE CONGREGATION DRANK AND THEIR LIVESTOCK

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON BECAUSE YOU DID NOT BELIEVE IN ME TO UPHOLD ME AS HOLY IN THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT BRING THIS ASSEMBLY INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM

 THESE ARE THE WATERS OF MERIBAH WHERE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL QUARRELED WITH THE LORD AND THROUGH THEM HE SHOWED HIMSELF HOLY

MOSES SENT MESSENGERS FROM KADESH TO THE KING OF EDOM THUS SAYS YOUR BROTHER ISRAEL YOU KNOW ALL THE HARDSHIP THAT WE HAVE MET HOW OUR FATHERS WENT DOWN TO EGYPT AND WE LIVED IN EGYPT A LONG TIME

AND THE EGYPTIANS DEALT HARSHLY WITH US AND OUR FATHERS

AND WHEN WE CRIED TO THE LORD HE HEARD OUR VOICE AND SENT AN ANGEL AND BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT

AND HERE WE ARE IN KADESH A CITY ON THE EDGE OF YOUR TERRITORY

PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND

WE WILL NOT PASS THROUGH FIELD OR VINEYARD OR DRINK WATER FROM A WELL

WE WILL GO ALONG THE KING'S HIGHWAY

WE WILL NOT TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT HAND OR TO THE LEFT UNTIL WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH YOUR TERRITORY

 BUT EDOM SAID TO HIM YOU SHALL NOT PASS THROUGH LEST I COME OUT WITH THE SWORD AGAINST YOU

 AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAID TO HIM WE WILL GO UP BY THE HIGHWAY AND IF WE DRINK OF YOUR WATER I AND MY LIVESTOCK THEN I WILL PAY FOR IT

LET ME ONLY PASS THROUGH ON FOOT NOTHING MORE

 BUT HE SAID YOU SHALL NOT PASS THROUGH

 AND EDOM CAME OUT AGAINST THEM WITH A LARGE ARMY AND WITH A STRONG FORCE

THUS EDOM REFUSED TO GIVE ISRAEL PASSAGE THROUGH HIS TERRITORY SO ISRAEL TURNED AWAY FROM HIM

AND THEY JOURNEYED FROM KADESH AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THE WHOLE CONGREGATION CAME TO MOUNT HOR

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON AT MOUNT HOR ON THE BORDER OF THE LAND OF EDOM LET AARON BE GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HE SHALL NOT ENTER THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE YOU REBELLED AGAINST MY COMMAND AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH

TAKE AARON AND ELEAZAR HIS SON AND BRING THEM UP TO MOUNT HOR

AND STRIP AARON OF HIS GARMENTS AND PUT THEM ON ELEAZAR HIS SON

AND AARON SHALL BE GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE AND SHALL DIE THERE

 MOSES DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED

AND THEY WENT UP MOUNT HOR IN THE SIGHT OF ALL THE CONGREGATION

AND MOSES STRIPPED AARON OF HIS GARMENTS AND PUT THEM ON ELEAZAR HIS SON

AND AARON DIED THERE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

THEN MOSES AND ELEAZAR CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN

AND WHEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD PERISHED ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WEPT FOR AARON THIRTY DAYS

WHEN THE CANAANITE THE KING OF ARAD WHO LIVED IN THE NEGEB HEARD THAT ISRAEL WAS COMING BY THE WAY OF ATHARIM HE FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL AND TOOK SOME OF THEM CAPTIVE

AND ISRAEL VOWED A VOW TO THE LORD AND SAID IF YOU WILL INDEED GIVE THIS PEOPLE INTO MY HAND THEN I WILL DEVOTE THEIR CITIES TO DESTRUCTION

 AND THE LORD OBEYED THE VOICE OF ISRAEL AND GAVE OVER THE CANAANITES AND THEY DEVOTED THEM AND THEIR CITIES TO DESTRUCTION

SO THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS CALLED HORMAH

FROM MOUNT HOR THEY SET OUT BY THE WAY TO THE RED SEA TO GO AROUND THE LAND OF EDOM

AND THE PEOPLE BECAME IMPATIENT ON THE WAY

AND THE PEOPLE SPOKE AGAINST GOD AND AGAINST MOSES WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT US UP OUT OF EGYPT TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS

FOR THERE IS NO FOOD AND NO WATER AND WE LOATHE THIS WORTHLESS FOOD

 THEN THE LORD SENT FIERY SERPENTS AMONG THE PEOPLE AND THEY BIT THE PEOPLE SO THAT MANY PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DIED

AND THE PEOPLE CAME TO MOSES AND SAID WE HAVE SINNED FOR WE HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST YOU

PRAY TO THE LORD THAT HE TAKE AWAY THE SERPENTS FROM US

 SO MOSES PRAYED FOR THE PEOPLE

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES MAKE A FIERY SERPENT AND SET IT ON A POLE AND EVERYONE WHO IS BITTEN WHEN HE SEES IT SHALL LIVE

 SO MOSES MADE A BRONZE SERPENT AND SET IT ON A POLE

AND IF A SERPENT BIT ANYONE HE WOULD LOOK AT THE BRONZE SERPENT AND LIVE

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT AND CAMPED IN OBOTH

AND THEY SET OUT FROM OBOTH AND CAMPED AT IYEABARIM IN THE WILDERNESS THAT IS OPPOSITE MOAB TOWARD THE SUNRISE

FROM THERE THEY SET OUT AND CAMPED IN THE VALLEY OF ZERED

FROM THERE THEY SET OUT AND CAMPED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARNON WHICH IS IN THE WILDERNESS THAT EXTENDS FROM THE BORDER OF THE AMORITES FOR THE ARNON IS THE BORDER OF MOAB BETWEEN MOAB AND THE AMORITES

WHEREFORE IT IS SAID IN THE BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD WAHEB IN SUPHAH AND THE VALLEYS OF THE ARNON AND THE SLOPE OF THE VALLEYS THAT EXTENDS TO THE SEAT OF AR AND LEANS TO THE BORDER OF MOAB

 AND FROM THERE THEY CONTINUED TO BEER; THAT IS THE WELL OF WHICH THE LORD SAID TO MOSES GATHER THE PEOPLE TOGETHER SO THAT I MAY GIVE THEM WATER

 THEN ISRAEL SANG THIS SONG SPRING UP O WELL

SING TO IT

 THE WELL THAT THE PRINCES DUG THAT THE NOBLES OF THE PEOPLE DELVED WITH THE SCEPTER AND WITH THEIR STAFFS

AND FROM THE WILDERNESS THEY WENT ON TO MATTANAH AND FROM MATTANAH TO NAHALIEL AND FROM NAHALIEL TO BAMOTH AND FROM BAMOTH TO THE VALLEY LYING IN THE REGION OF MOAB BY THE TOP OF PISGAH THAT LOOKS DOWN ON THE DESERT

THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS TO SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES SAYING LET ME PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND

WE WILL NOT TURN ASIDE INTO FIELD OR VINEYARD

WE WILL NOT DRINK THE WATER OF A WELL

WE WILL GO BY THE KING'S HIGHWAY UNTIL WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH YOUR TERRITORY

 BUT SIHON WOULD NOT ALLOW ISRAEL TO PASS THROUGH HIS TERRITORY

HE GATHERED ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WENT OUT AGAINST ISRAEL TO THE WILDERNESS AND CAME TO JAHAZ AND FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

AND ISRAEL DEFEATED HIM WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS LAND FROM THE ARNON TO THE JABBOK AS FAR AS TO THE AMMONITES FOR THE BORDER OF THE AMMONITES WAS STRONG

AND ISRAEL TOOK ALL THESE CITIES AND ISRAEL SETTLED IN ALL THE CITIES OF THE AMORITES IN HESHBON AND IN ALL ITS VILLAGES

FOR HESHBON WAS THE CITY OF SIHON THE KING OF THE AMORITES WHO HAD FOUGHT AGAINST THE FORMER KING OF MOAB AND TAKEN ALL HIS LAND OUT OF HIS HAND AS FAR AS THE ARNON

THEREFORE THE BALLAD SINGERS SAY COME TO HESHBON LET IT BE BUILT; LET THE CITY OF SIHON BE ESTABLISHED

FOR FIRE CAME OUT FROM HESHBON FLAME FROM THE CITY OF SIHON

IT DEVOURED AR OF MOAB AND SWALLOWED THE HEIGHTS OF THE ARNON

WOE TO YOU O MOAB

YOU ARE UNDONE O PEOPLE OF CHEMOSH

HE HAS MADE HIS SONS FUGITIVES AND HIS DAUGHTERS CAPTIVES TO AN AMORITE KING SIHON

SO WE OVERTHREW THEM; HESHBON AS FAR AS DIBON PERISHED; AND WE LAID WASTE AS FAR AS NOPHAH; FIRE SPREAD AS FAR AS MEDEBA

 THUS ISRAEL LIVED IN THE LAND OF THE AMORITES

AND MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT JAZER AND THEY CAPTURED ITS VILLAGES AND DISPOSSESSED THE AMORITES WHO WERE THERE

THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP BY THE WAY TO BASHAN

AND OG THE KING OF BASHAN CAME OUT AGAINST THEM HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE TO BATTLE AT EDREI

BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES DO NOT FEAR HIM FOR I HAVE GIVEN HIM INTO YOUR HAND AND ALL HIS PEOPLE AND HIS LAND

AND YOU SHALL DO TO HIM AS YOU DID TO SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES WHO LIVED AT HESHBON

 SO THEY DEFEATED HIM AND HIS SONS AND ALL HIS PEOPLE UNTIL HE HAD NO SURVIVOR LEFT

AND THEY POSSESSED HIS LAND

THEN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SET OUT AND CAMPED IN THE PLAINS OF MOAB BEYOND THE JORDAN AT JERICHO

AND BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR SAW ALL THAT ISRAEL HAD DONE TO THE AMORITES

AND MOAB WAS IN GREAT DREAD OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE MANY

MOAB WAS OVERCOME WITH FEAR OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND MOAB SAID TO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN THIS HORDE WILL NOW LICK UP ALL THAT IS AROUND US AS THE OX LICKS UP THE GRASS OF THE FIELD

 SO BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR WHO WAS KING OF MOAB AT THAT TIME SENT MESSENGERS TO BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR AT PETHOR WHICH IS NEAR THE RIVER IN THE LAND OF THE PEOPLE OF AMAW TO CALL HIM SAYING BEHOLD A PEOPLE HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT

THEY COVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND THEY ARE DWELLING OPPOSITE ME

COME NOW CURSE THIS PEOPLE FOR ME SINCE THEY ARE TOO MIGHTY FOR ME

PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO DEFEAT THEM AND DRIVE THEM FROM THE LAND FOR I KNOW THAT HE WHOM YOU BLESS IS BLESSED AND HE WHOM YOU CURSE IS CURSED

 SO THE ELDERS OF MOAB AND THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN DEPARTED WITH THE FEES FOR DIVINATION IN THEIR HAND

AND THEY CAME TO BALAAM AND GAVE HIM BALAK'S MESSAGE

AND HE SAID TO THEM LODGE HERE TONIGHT AND I WILL BRING BACK WORD TO YOU AS THE LORD SPEAKS TO ME

 SO THE PRINCES OF MOAB STAYED WITH BALAAM

AND GOD CAME TO BALAAM AND SAID WHO ARE THESE MEN WITH YOU

 AND BALAAM SAID TO GOD BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR KING OF MOAB HAS SENT TO ME SAYING 'BEHOLD A PEOPLE HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT AND IT COVERS THE FACE OF THE EARTH

NOW COME CURSE THEM FOR ME

PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM AND DRIVE THEM OUT

' GOD SAID TO BALAAM YOU SHALL NOT GO WITH THEM

YOU SHALL NOT CURSE THE PEOPLE FOR THEY ARE BLESSED

 SO BALAAM ROSE IN THE MORNING AND SAID TO THE PRINCES OF BALAK GO TO YOUR OWN LAND FOR THE LORD HAS REFUSED TO LET ME GO WITH YOU

 SO THE PRINCES OF MOAB ROSE AND WENT TO BALAK AND SAID BALAAM REFUSES TO COME WITH US

 ONCE AGAIN BALAK SENT PRINCES MORE IN NUMBER AND MORE HONORABLE THAN THESE

AND THEY CAME TO BALAAM AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS BALAK THE SON OF ZIPPOR 'LET NOTHING HINDER YOU FROM COMING TO ME FOR I WILL SURELY DO YOU GREAT HONOR AND WHATEVER YOU SAY TO ME I WILL DO

COME CURSE THIS PEOPLE FOR ME

' BUT BALAAM ANSWERED AND SAID TO THE SERVANTS OF BALAK THOUGH BALAK WERE TO GIVE ME HIS HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD I COULD NOT GO BEYOND THE COMMAND OF THE LORD MY GOD TO DO LESS OR MORE

SO YOU TOO PLEASE STAY HERE TONIGHT THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT MORE THE LORD WILL SAY TO ME

 AND GOD CAME TO BALAAM AT NIGHT AND SAID TO HIM IF THE MEN HAVE COME TO CALL YOU RISE GO WITH THEM; BUT ONLY DO WHAT I TELL YOU

 SO BALAAM ROSE IN THE MORNING AND SADDLED HIS DONKEY AND WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB

BUT GOD'S ANGER WAS KINDLED BECAUSE HE WENT AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD TOOK HIS STAND IN THE WAY AS HIS ADVERSARY

NOW HE WAS RIDING ON THE DONKEY AND HIS TWO SERVANTS WERE WITH HIM

AND THE DONKEY SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STANDING IN THE ROAD WITH A DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND

AND THE DONKEY TURNED ASIDE OUT OF THE ROAD AND WENT INTO THE FIELD

AND BALAAM STRUCK THE DONKEY TO TURN HER INTO THE ROAD

THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD IN A NARROW PATH BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS WITH A WALL ON EITHER SIDE

AND WHEN THE DONKEY SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SHE PUSHED AGAINST THE WALL AND PRESSED BALAAM'S FOOT AGAINST THE WALL

SO HE STRUCK HER AGAIN

THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT AHEAD AND STOOD IN A NARROW PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO WAY TO TURN EITHER TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT

WHEN THE DONKEY SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SHE LAY DOWN UNDER BALAAM

AND BALAAM'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AND HE STRUCK THE DONKEY WITH HIS STAFF

THEN THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE DONKEY AND SHE SAID TO BALAAM WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE STRUCK ME THESE THREE TIMES

 AND BALAAM SAID TO THE DONKEY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE A FOOL OF ME

I WISH I HAD A SWORD IN MY HAND FOR THEN I WOULD KILL YOU

 AND THE DONKEY SAID TO BALAAM AM I NOT YOUR DONKEY ON WHICH YOU HAVE RIDDEN ALL YOUR LIFE LONG TO THIS DAY

IS IT MY HABIT TO TREAT YOU THIS WAY

 AND HE SAID NO

 THEN THE LORD OPENED THE EYES OF BALAAM AND HE SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STANDING IN THE WAY WITH HIS DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND

AND HE BOWED DOWN AND FELL ON HIS FACE

AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO HIM WHY HAVE YOU STRUCK YOUR DONKEY THESE THREE TIMES

BEHOLD I HAVE COME OUT TO OPPOSE YOU BECAUSE YOUR WAY IS PERVERSE BEFORE ME

THE DONKEY SAW ME AND TURNED ASIDE BEFORE ME THESE THREE TIMES

IF SHE HAD NOT TURNED ASIDE FROM ME SURELY JUST NOW I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU AND LET HER LIVE

 THEN BALAAM SAID TO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD I HAVE SINNED FOR I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU STOOD IN THE ROAD AGAINST ME

NOW THEREFORE IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR SIGHT I WILL TURN BACK

 AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO BALAAM GO WITH THE MEN BUT SPEAK ONLY THE WORD THAT I TELL YOU

 SO BALAAM WENT ON WITH THE PRINCES OF BALAK

WHEN BALAK HEARD THAT BALAAM HAD COME HE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AT THE CITY OF MOAB ON THE BORDER FORMED BY THE ARNON AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE BORDER

AND BALAK SAID TO BALAAM DID I NOT SEND TO YOU TO CALL YOU

WHY DID YOU NOT COME TO ME

AM I NOT ABLE TO HONOR YOU

 BALAAM SAID TO BALAK BEHOLD I HAVE COME TO YOU

HAVE I NOW ANY POWER OF MY OWN TO SPEAK ANYTHING

THE WORD THAT GOD PUTS IN MY MOUTH THAT MUST I SPEAK

 THEN BALAAM WENT WITH BALAK AND THEY CAME TO KIRIATHHUZOTH

AND BALAK SACRIFICED OXEN AND SHEEP AND SENT FOR BALAAM AND FOR THE PRINCES WHO WERE WITH HIM

AND IN THE MORNING BALAK TOOK BALAAM AND BROUGHT HIM UP TO BAMOTHBAAL AND FROM THERE HE SAW A FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE

AND BALAAM SAID TO BALAK BUILD FOR ME HERE SEVEN ALTARS AND PREPARE FOR ME HERE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS

 BALAK DID AS BALAAM HAD SAID

AND BALAK AND BALAAM OFFERED ON EACH ALTAR A BULL AND A RAM

AND BALAAM SAID TO BALAK STAND BESIDE YOUR BURNT OFFERING AND I WILL GO

PERHAPS THE LORD WILL COME TO MEET ME AND WHATEVER HE SHOWS ME I WILL TELL YOU

 AND HE WENT TO A BARE HEIGHT AND GOD MET BALAAM

AND BALAAM SAID TO HIM I HAVE ARRANGED THE SEVEN ALTARS AND I HAVE OFFERED ON EACH ALTAR A BULL AND A RAM

 AND THE LORD PUT A WORD IN BALAAM'S MOUTH AND SAID RETURN TO BALAK AND THUS YOU SHALL SPEAK

 AND HE RETURNED TO HIM AND BEHOLD HE AND ALL THE PRINCES OF MOAB WERE STANDING BESIDE HIS BURNT OFFERING

AND BALAAM TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID FROM ARAM BALAK HAS BROUGHT ME THE KING OF MOAB FROM THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS 'COME CURSE JACOB FOR ME AND COME DENOUNCE ISRAEL

' HOW CAN I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED

HOW CAN I DENOUNCE WHOM THE LORD HAS NOT DENOUNCED

FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE CRAGS I SEE HIM FROM THE HILLS I BEHOLD HIM; BEHOLD A PEOPLE DWELLING ALONE AND NOT COUNTING ITSELF AMONG THE NATIONS

WHO CAN COUNT THE DUST OF JACOB OR NUMBER THE FOURTH PART OF ISRAEL

LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE UPRIGHT AND LET MY END BE LIKE HIS

 AND BALAK SAID TO BALAAM WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME

I TOOK YOU TO CURSE MY ENEMIES AND BEHOLD YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT BLESS THEM

 AND HE ANSWERED AND SAID MUST I NOT TAKE CARE TO SPEAK WHAT THE LORD PUTS IN MY MOUTH

 AND BALAK SAID TO HIM PLEASE COME WITH ME TO ANOTHER PLACE FROM WHICH YOU MAY SEE THEM

YOU SHALL SEE ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM AND SHALL NOT SEE THEM ALL

THEN CURSE THEM FOR ME FROM THERE

 AND HE TOOK HIM TO THE FIELD OF ZOPHIM TO THE TOP OF PISGAH AND BUILT SEVEN ALTARS AND OFFERED A BULL AND A RAM ON EACH ALTAR

BALAAM SAID TO BALAK STAND HERE BESIDE YOUR BURNT OFFERING WHILE I MEET THE LORD OVER THERE

 AND THE LORD MET BALAAM AND PUT A WORD IN HIS MOUTH AND SAID RETURN TO BALAK AND THUS SHALL YOU SPEAK

 AND HE CAME TO HIM AND BEHOLD HE WAS STANDING BESIDE HIS BURNT OFFERING AND THE PRINCES OF MOAB WITH HIM

AND BALAK SAID TO HIM WHAT HAS THE LORD SPOKEN

 AND BALAAM TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID RISE BALAK AND HEAR; GIVE EAR TO ME O SON OF ZIPPOR GOD IS NOT MAN THAT HE SHOULD LIE OR A SON OF MAN THAT HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND

HAS HE SAID AND WILL HE NOT DO IT

OR HAS HE SPOKEN AND WILL HE NOT FULFILL IT

BEHOLD I RECEIVED A COMMAND TO BLESS HE HAS BLESSED AND I CANNOT REVOKE IT

HE HAS NOT BEHELD MISFORTUNE IN JACOB NOR HAS HE SEEN TROUBLE IN ISRAEL

THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH THEM AND THE SHOUT OF A KING IS AMONG THEM

GOD BRINGS THEM OUT OF EGYPT AND IS FOR THEM LIKE THE HORNS OF THE WILD OX

FOR THERE IS NO ENCHANTMENT AGAINST JACOB NO DIVINATION AGAINST ISRAEL; NOW IT SHALL BE SAID OF JACOB AND ISRAEL 'WHAT HAS GOD WROUGHT

' BEHOLD A PEOPLE

AS A LIONESS IT RISES UP AND AS A LION IT LIFTS ITSELF; IT DOES NOT LIE DOWN UNTIL IT HAS DEVOURED THE PREY AND DRUNK THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN

 AND BALAK SAID TO BALAAM DO NOT CURSE THEM AT ALL AND DO NOT BLESS THEM AT ALL

 BUT BALAAM ANSWERED BALAK DID I NOT TELL YOU 'ALL THAT THE LORD SAYS THAT I MUST DO'

 AND BALAK SAID TO BALAAM COME NOW I WILL TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER PLACE

PERHAPS IT WILL PLEASE GOD THAT YOU MAY CURSE THEM FOR ME FROM THERE

 SO BALAK TOOK BALAAM TO THE TOP OF PEOR WHICH OVERLOOKS THE DESERT

AND BALAAM SAID TO BALAK BUILD FOR ME HERE SEVEN ALTARS AND PREPARE FOR ME HERE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS

 AND BALAK DID AS BALAAM HAD SAID AND OFFERED A BULL AND A RAM ON EACH ALTAR

WHEN BALAAM SAW THAT IT PLEASED THE LORD TO BLESS ISRAEL HE DID NOT GO AS AT OTHER TIMES TO LOOK FOR OMENS BUT SET HIS FACE TOWARD THE WILDERNESS

AND BALAAM LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND SAW ISRAEL CAMPING TRIBE BY TRIBE

AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME UPON HIM AND HE TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID THE ORACLE OF BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR THE ORACLE OF THE MAN WHOSE EYE IS OPENED THE ORACLE OF HIM WHO HEARS THE WORDS OF GOD WHO SEES THE VISION OF THE ALMIGHTY FALLING DOWN WITH HIS EYES UNCOVERED HOW LOVELY ARE YOUR TENTS O JACOB YOUR ENCAMPMENTS O ISRAEL

LIKE PALM GROVES THAT STRETCH AFAR LIKE GARDENS BESIDE A RIVER LIKE ALOES THAT THE LORD HAS PLANTED LIKE CEDAR TREES BESIDE THE WATERS

WATER SHALL FLOW FROM HIS BUCKETS AND HIS SEED SHALL BE IN MANY WATERS; HIS KING SHALL BE HIGHER THAN AGAG AND HIS KINGDOM SHALL BE EXALTED

GOD BRINGS HIM OUT OF EGYPT AND IS FOR HIM LIKE THE HORNS OF THE WILD OX; HE SHALL EAT UP THE NATIONS HIS ADVERSARIES AND SHALL BREAK THEIR BONES IN PIECES AND PIERCE THEM THROUGH WITH HIS ARROWS

HE CROUCHED HE LAY DOWN LIKE A LION AND LIKE A LIONESS; WHO WILL ROUSE HIM UP

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO BLESS YOU AND CURSED ARE THOSE WHO CURSE YOU

 AND BALAK'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST BALAAM AND HE STRUCK HIS HANDS TOGETHER

AND BALAK SAID TO BALAAM I CALLED YOU TO CURSE MY ENEMIES AND BEHOLD YOU HAVE BLESSED THEM THESE THREE TIMES

THEREFORE NOW FLEE TO YOUR OWN PLACE

I SAID 'I WILL CERTAINLY HONOR YOU' BUT THE LORD HAS HELD YOU BACK FROM HONOR

 AND BALAAM SAID TO BALAK DID I NOT TELL YOUR MESSENGERS WHOM YOU SENT TO ME 'IF BALAK SHOULD GIVE ME HIS HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO BEYOND THE WORD OF THE LORD TO DO EITHER GOOD OR BAD OF MY OWN WILL

WHAT THE LORD SPEAKS THAT WILL I SPEAK'

AND NOW BEHOLD I AM GOING TO MY PEOPLE

COME I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PEOPLE WILL DO TO YOUR PEOPLE IN THE LATTER DAYS

 AND HE TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID THE ORACLE OF BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR THE ORACLE OF THE MAN WHOSE EYE IS OPENED THE ORACLE OF HIM WHO HEARS THE WORDS OF GOD AND KNOWS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST HIGH WHO SEES THE VISION OF THE ALMIGHTY FALLING DOWN WITH HIS EYES UNCOVERED I SEE HIM BUT NOT NOW; I BEHOLD HIM BUT NOT NEAR A STAR SHALL COME OUT OF JACOB AND A SCEPTER SHALL RISE OUT OF ISRAEL; IT SHALL CRUSH THE FOREHEAD OF MOAB AND BREAK DOWN ALL THE SONS OF SHETH

EDOM SHALL BE DISPOSSESSED; SEIR ALSO HIS ENEMIES SHALL BE DISPOSSESSED

ISRAEL IS DOING VALIANTLY

AND ONE FROM JACOB SHALL EXERCISE DOMINION AND DESTROY THE SURVIVORS OF CITIES

 THEN HE LOOKED ON AMALEK AND TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID AMALEK WAS THE FIRST AMONG THE NATIONS BUT ITS END IS UTTER DESTRUCTION

 AND HE LOOKED ON THE KENITE AND TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID ENDURING IS YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND YOUR NEST IS SET IN THE ROCK

NEVERTHELESS KAIN SHALL BE BURNED WHEN ASSHUR TAKES YOU AWAY CAPTIVE

 AND HE TOOK UP HIS DISCOURSE AND SAID ALAS WHO SHALL LIVE WHEN GOD DOES THIS

BUT SHIPS SHALL COME FROM KITTIM AND SHALL AFFLICT ASSHUR AND EBER; AND HE TOO SHALL COME TO UTTER DESTRUCTION

 THEN BALAAM ROSE AND WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE

AND BALAK ALSO WENT HIS WAY

WHILE ISRAEL LIVED IN SHITTIM THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO WHORE WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB

THESE INVITED THE PEOPLE TO THE SACRIFICES OF THEIR GODS AND THE PEOPLE ATE AND BOWED DOWN TO THEIR GODS

SO ISRAEL YOKED HIMSELF TO BAAL OF PEOR

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES TAKE ALL THE CHIEFS OF THE PEOPLE AND HANG THEM IN THE SUN BEFORE THE LORD THAT THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD MAY TURN AWAY FROM ISRAEL

 AND MOSES SAID TO THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL EACH OF YOU KILL THOSE OF HIS MEN WHO HAVE YOKED THEMSELVES TO BAAL OF PEOR

 AND BEHOLD ONE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME AND BROUGHT A MIDIANITE WOMAN TO HIS FAMILY IN THE SIGHT OF MOSES AND IN THE SIGHT OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHILE THEY WERE WEEPING IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING

WHEN PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR SON OF AARON THE PRIEST SAW IT HE ROSE AND LEFT THE CONGREGATION AND TOOK A SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE CHAMBER AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM THE MAN OF ISRAEL AND THE WOMAN THROUGH HER BELLY

THUS THE PLAGUE ON THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WAS STOPPED

NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO DIED BY THE PLAGUE WERE TWENTYFOUR THOUSAND

AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR SON OF AARON THE PRIEST HAS TURNED BACK MY WRATH FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN THAT HE WAS JEALOUS WITH MY JEALOUSY AMONG THEM SO THAT I DID NOT CONSUME THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN MY JEALOUSY

THEREFORE SAY 'BEHOLD I GIVE TO HIM MY COVENANT OF PEACE AND IT SHALL BE TO HIM AND TO HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM THE COVENANT OF A PERPETUAL PRIESTHOOD BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS FOR HIS GOD AND MADE ATONEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

' THE NAME OF THE SLAIN MAN OF ISRAEL WHO WAS KILLED WITH THE MIDIANITE WOMAN WAS ZIMRI THE SON OF SALU CHIEF OF A FATHER'S HOUSE BELONGING TO THE SIMEONITES

AND THE NAME OF THE MIDIANITE WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED WAS COZBI THE DAUGHTER OF ZUR WHO WAS THE TRIBAL HEAD OF A FATHER'S HOUSE IN MIDIAN

AND THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING HARASS THE MIDIANITES AND STRIKE THEM DOWN FOR THEY HAVE HARASSED YOU WITH THEIR WILES WITH WHICH THEY BEGUILED YOU IN THE MATTER OF PEOR AND IN THE MATTER OF COZBI THE DAUGHTER OF THE CHIEF OF MIDIAN THEIR SISTER WHO WAS KILLED ON THE DAY OF THE PLAGUE ON ACCOUNT OF PEOR

AFTER THE PLAGUE THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND TO ELEAZAR THE SON OF AARON THE PRIEST TAKE A CENSUS OF ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD BY THEIR FATHERS' HOUSES ALL IN ISRAEL WHO ARE ABLE TO GO TO WAR

 AND MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SPOKE WITH THEM IN THE PLAINS OF MOAB BY THE JORDAN AT JERICHO SAYING TAKE A CENSUS OF THE PEOPLE FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

HE WAS NOT AMONG THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD IN THE COMPANY OF KORAH BUT DIED FOR HIS OWN SIN

AND HE HAD NO SONS

WHY SHOULD THE NAME OF OUR FATHER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIS CLAN BECAUSE HE HAD NO SON

GIVE TO US A POSSESSION AMONG OUR FATHER'S BROTHERS

 MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CASE BEFORE THE LORD

 THESE ARE THE WATERS OF MERIBAH OF KADESH IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN

 MOSES SPOKE TO THE LORD SAYING LET THE LORD THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH APPOINT A MAN OVER THE CONGREGATION WHO SHALL GO OUT BEFORE THEM AND COME IN BEFORE THEM WHO SHALL LEAD THEM OUT AND BRING THEM IN THAT THE CONGREGATION OF THE LORD MAY NOT BE AS SHEEP THAT HAVE NO SHEPHERD

 SO MOSES TOLD THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL EVERYTHING JUST AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES

MOSES SPOKE TO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SAYING THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED

IF A MAN VOWS A VOW TO THE LORD OR SWEARS AN OATH TO BIND HIMSELF BY A PLEDGE HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS WORD

HE SHALL DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH

IF A WOMAN VOWS A VOW TO THE LORD AND BINDS HERSELF BY A PLEDGE WHILE WITHIN HER FATHER'S HOUSE IN HER YOUTH AND HER FATHER HEARS OF HER VOW AND OF HER PLEDGE BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF AND SAYS NOTHING TO HER THEN ALL HER VOWS SHALL STAND AND EVERY PLEDGE BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF SHALL STAND

BUT IF HER FATHER OPPOSES HER ON THE DAY THAT HE HEARS OF IT NO VOW OF HERS NO PLEDGE BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF SHALL STAND

AND THE LORD WILL FORGIVE HER BECAUSE HER FATHER OPPOSED HER

IF SHE MARRIES A HUSBAND WHILE UNDER HER VOWS OR ANY THOUGHTLESS UTTERANCE OF HER LIPS BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF AND HER HUSBAND HEARS OF IT AND SAYS NOTHING TO HER ON THE DAY THAT HE HEARS THEN HER VOWS SHALL STAND AND HER PLEDGES BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF SHALL STAND

BUT IF ON THE DAY THAT HER HUSBAND COMES TO HEAR OF IT HE OPPOSES HER THEN HE MAKES VOID HER VOW THAT WAS ON HER AND THE THOUGHTLESS UTTERANCE OF HER LIPS BY WHICH SHE BOUND HERSELF

AND THE LORD WILL FORGIVE HER

BUT ANY VOW OF A WIDOW OR OF A DIVORCED WOMAN ANYTHING BY WHICH SHE HAS BOUND HERSELF SHALL STAND AGAINST HER

 AND IF SHE VOWED IN HER HUSBAND'S HOUSE OR BOUND HERSELF BY A PLEDGE WITH AN OATH AND HER HUSBAND HEARD OF IT AND SAID NOTHING TO HER AND DID NOT OPPOSE HER THEN ALL HER VOWS SHALL STAND AND EVERY PLEDGE BY WHICH SHE BOUND HERSELF SHALL STAND

BUT IF HER HUSBAND MAKES THEM NULL AND VOID ON THE DAY THAT HE HEARS THEM THEN WHATEVER PROCEEDS OUT OF HER LIPS CONCERNING HER VOWS OR CONCERNING HER PLEDGE OF HERSELF SHALL NOT STAND

HER HUSBAND HAS MADE THEM VOID AND THE LORD WILL FORGIVE HER

ANY VOW AND ANY BINDING OATH TO AFFLICT HERSELF HER HUSBAND MAY ESTABLISH OR HER HUSBAND MAY MAKE VOID

BUT IF HER HUSBAND SAYS NOTHING TO HER FROM DAY TO DAY THEN HE ESTABLISHES ALL HER VOWS OR ALL HER PLEDGES THAT ARE UPON HER

HE HAS ESTABLISHED THEM BECAUSE HE SAID NOTHING TO HER ON THE DAY THAT HE HEARD OF THEM

BUT IF HE MAKES THEM NULL AND VOID AFTER HE HAS HEARD OF THEM THEN HE SHALL BEAR HER INIQUITY

 THESE ARE THE STATUTES THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES ABOUT A MAN AND HIS WIFE AND ABOUT A FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER WHILE SHE IS IN HER YOUTH WITHIN HER FATHER'S HOUSE

THE LORD SPOKE TO MOSES SAYING AVENGE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ON THE MIDIANITES

AFTERWARD YOU SHALL BE GATHERED TO YOUR PEOPLE

 SO MOSES SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE SAYING ARM MEN FROM AMONG YOU FOR THE WAR THAT THEY MAY GO AGAINST MIDIAN TO EXECUTE THE LORD'S VENGEANCE ON MIDIAN

YOU SHALL SEND A THOUSAND FROM EACH OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO THE WAR

 SO THERE WERE PROVIDED OUT OF THE THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL A THOUSAND FROM EACH TRIBE TWELVE THOUSAND ARMED FOR WAR

AND MOSES SENT THEM TO THE WAR A THOUSAND FROM EACH TRIBE TOGETHER WITH PHINEHAS THE SON OF ELEAZAR THE PRIEST WITH THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE TRUMPETS FOR THE ALARM IN HIS HAND

THEY WARRED AGAINST MIDIAN AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES AND KILLED EVERY MALE

THEY KILLED THE KINGS OF MIDIAN WITH THE REST OF THEIR SLAIN EVI REKEM ZUR HUR AND REBA THE FIVE KINGS OF MIDIAN

AND THEY ALSO KILLED BALAAM THE SON OF BEOR WITH THE SWORD

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TOOK CAPTIVE THE WOMEN OF MIDIAN AND THEIR LITTLE ONES AND THEY TOOK AS PLUNDER ALL THEIR CATTLE THEIR FLOCKS AND ALL THEIR GOODS

ALL THEIR CITIES IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY LIVED AND ALL THEIR ENCAMPMENTS THEY BURNED WITH FIRE AND TOOK ALL THE SPOIL AND ALL THE PLUNDER BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST

THEN THEY BROUGHT THE CAPTIVES AND THE PLUNDER AND THE SPOIL TO MOSES AND TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND TO THE CONGREGATION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AT THE CAMP ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB BY THE JORDAN AT JERICHO

MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND ALL THE CHIEFS OF THE CONGREGATION WENT TO MEET THEM OUTSIDE THE CAMP

AND MOSES WAS ANGRY WITH THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND THE COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS WHO HAD COME FROM SERVICE IN THE WAR

MOSES SAID TO THEM HAVE YOU LET ALL THE WOMEN LIVE

BEHOLD THESE ON BALAAM'S ADVICE CAUSED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO ACT TREACHEROUSLY AGAINST THE LORD IN THE INCIDENT OF PEOR AND SO THE PLAGUE CAME AMONG THE CONGREGATION OF THE LORD

NOW THEREFORE KILL EVERY MALE AMONG THE LITTLE ONES AND KILL EVERY WOMAN WHO HAS KNOWN MAN BY LYING WITH HIM

BUT ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN MAN BY LYING WITH HIM KEEP ALIVE FOR YOURSELVES

ENCAMP OUTSIDE THE CAMP SEVEN DAYS

WHOEVER OF YOU HAS KILLED ANY PERSON AND WHOEVER HAS TOUCHED ANY SLAIN PURIFY YOURSELVES AND YOUR CAPTIVES ON THE THIRD DAY AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY

YOU SHALL PURIFY EVERY GARMENT EVERY ARTICLE OF SKIN ALL WORK OF GOATS' HAIR AND EVERY ARTICLE OF WOOD

 THEN ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SAID TO THE MEN IN THE ARMY WHO HAD GONE TO BATTLE THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE LAW THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED MOSES ONLY THE GOLD THE SILVER THE BRONZE THE IRON THE TIN AND THE LEAD EVERYTHING THAT CAN STAND THE FIRE YOU SHALL PASS THROUGH THE FIRE AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN

NEVERTHELESS IT SHALL ALSO BE PURIFIED WITH THE WATER FOR IMPURITY

AND WHATEVER CANNOT STAND THE FIRE YOU SHALL PASS THROUGH THE WATER

YOU MUST WASH YOUR CLOTHES ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND YOU SHALL BE CLEAN

AND AFTERWARD YOU MAY COME INTO THE CAMP

 THE LORD SAID TO MOSES TAKE THE COUNT OF THE PLUNDER THAT WAS TAKEN BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST YOU AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE CONGREGATION AND DIVIDE THE PLUNDER INTO TWO PARTS BETWEEN THE WARRIORS WHO WENT OUT TO BATTLE AND ALL THE CONGREGATION

AND LEVY FOR THE LORD A TRIBUTE FROM THE MEN OF WAR WHO WENT OUT TO BATTLE ONE OUT OF FIVE HUNDRED OF THE PEOPLE AND OF THE OXEN AND OF THE DONKEYS AND OF THE FLOCKS

TAKE IT FROM THEIR HALF AND GIVE IT TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LORD

AND FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL'S HALF YOU SHALL TAKE ONE DRAWN OUT OF EVERY FIFTY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE OXEN OF THE DONKEYS AND OF THE FLOCKS OF ALL THE CATTLE AND GIVE THEM TO THE LEVITES WHO KEEP GUARD OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD

 AND MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

NOW THE PLUNDER REMAINING OF THE SPOIL THAT THE ARMY TOOK WAS  SHEEP  CATTLE  DONKEYS AND  PERSONS IN ALL WOMEN WHO HAD NOT KNOWN MAN BY LYING WITH HIM

AND THE HALF THE PORTION OF THOSE WHO HAD GONE OUT IN THE ARMY NUMBERED  SHEEP AND THE LORD'S TRIBUTE OF SHEEP WAS 

THE CATTLE WERE  OF WHICH THE LORD'S TRIBUTE WAS 

THE DONKEYS WERE  OF WHICH THE LORD'S TRIBUTE WAS 

THE PERSONS WERE  OF WHICH THE LORD'S TRIBUTE WAS  PERSONS

AND MOSES GAVE THE TRIBUTE WHICH WAS THE CONTRIBUTION FOR THE LORD TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL'S HALF WHICH MOSES SEPARATED FROM THAT OF THE MEN WHO HAD SERVED IN THE ARMY NOW THE CONGREGATION'S HALF WAS  SHEEP  CATTLE AND  DONKEYS AND  PERSONS FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL'S HALF MOSES TOOK ONE OF EVERY  BOTH OF PERSONS AND OF BEASTS AND GAVE THEM TO THE LEVITES WHO KEPT GUARD OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

THEN THE OFFICERS WHO WERE OVER THE THOUSANDS OF THE ARMY THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND THE COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS CAME NEAR TO MOSES AND SAID TO MOSES YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COUNTED THE MEN OF WAR WHO ARE UNDER OUR COMMAND AND THERE IS NOT A MAN MISSING FROM US

AND WE HAVE BROUGHT THE LORD'S OFFERING WHAT EACH MAN FOUND ARTICLES OF GOLD ARMLETS AND BRACELETS SIGNET RINGS EARRINGS AND BEADS TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR OURSELVES BEFORE THE LORD

 AND MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST RECEIVED FROM THEM THE GOLD ALL CRAFTED ARTICLES

AND ALL THE GOLD OF THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY PRESENTED TO THE LORD FROM THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND THE COMMANDERS OF HUNDREDS WAS  SHEKELS

THE MEN IN THE ARMY HAD EACH TAKEN PLUNDER FOR HIMSELF

 AND MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST RECEIVED THE GOLD FROM THE COMMANDERS OF THOUSANDS AND OF HUNDREDS AND BROUGHT IT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING AS A MEMORIAL FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BEFORE THE LORD

NOW THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD HAD A VERY GREAT NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK

AND THEY SAW THE LAND OF JAZER AND THE LAND OF GILEAD AND BEHOLD THE PLACE WAS A PLACE FOR LIVESTOCK

SO THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN CAME AND SAID TO MOSES AND TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND TO THE CHIEFS OF THE CONGREGATION ATAROTH DIBON JAZER NIMRAH HESHBON ELEALEH SEBAM NEBO AND BEON THE LAND THAT THE LORD STRUCK DOWN BEFORE THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL IS A LAND FOR LIVESTOCK AND YOUR SERVANTS HAVE LIVESTOCK

 AND THEY SAID IF WE HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR SIGHT LET THIS LAND BE GIVEN TO YOUR SERVANTS FOR A POSSESSION

DO NOT TAKE US ACROSS THE JORDAN

 BUT MOSES SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND TO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN SHALL YOUR BROTHERS GO TO THE WAR WHILE YOU SIT HERE

WHY WILL YOU DISCOURAGE THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM GOING OVER INTO THE LAND THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN THEM

YOUR FATHERS DID THIS WHEN I SENT THEM FROM KADESHBARNEA TO SEE THE LAND

FOR WHEN THEY WENT UP TO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL AND SAW THE LAND THEY DISCOURAGED THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM GOING INTO THE LAND THAT THE LORD HAD GIVEN THEM

AND THE LORD'S ANGER WAS KINDLED ON THAT DAY AND HE SWORE SAYING 'SURELY NONE OF THE MEN WHO CAME UP OUT OF EGYPT FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD SHALL SEE THE LAND THAT I SWORE TO GIVE TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND TO JACOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT WHOLLY FOLLOWED ME NONE EXCEPT CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH THE KENIZZITE AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN FOR THEY HAVE WHOLLY FOLLOWED THE LORD

' AND THE LORD'S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE MADE THEM WANDER IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS UNTIL ALL THE GENERATION THAT HAD DONE EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD WAS GONE

AND BEHOLD YOU HAVE RISEN IN YOUR FATHERS' PLACE A BROOD OF SINFUL MEN TO INCREASE STILL MORE THE FIERCE ANGER OF THE LORD AGAINST ISRAEL

FOR IF YOU TURN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING HIM HE WILL AGAIN ABANDON THEM IN THE WILDERNESS AND YOU WILL DESTROY ALL THIS PEOPLE

 THEN THEY CAME NEAR TO HIM AND SAID WE WILL BUILD SHEEPFOLDS HERE FOR OUR LIVESTOCK AND CITIES FOR OUR LITTLE ONES BUT WE WILL TAKE UP ARMS READY TO GO BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL UNTIL WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR PLACE

AND OUR LITTLE ONES SHALL LIVE IN THE FORTIFIED CITIES BECAUSE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND

WE WILL NOT RETURN TO OUR HOMES UNTIL EACH OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAS GAINED HIS INHERITANCE

FOR WE WILL NOT INHERIT WITH THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN AND BEYOND BECAUSE OUR INHERITANCE HAS COME TO US ON THIS SIDE OF THE JORDAN TO THE EAST

 SO MOSES SAID TO THEM IF YOU WILL DO THIS IF YOU WILL TAKE UP ARMS TO GO BEFORE THE LORD FOR THE WAR AND EVERY ARMED MAN OF YOU WILL PASS OVER THE JORDAN BEFORE THE LORD UNTIL HE HAS DRIVEN OUT HIS ENEMIES FROM BEFORE HIM AND THE LAND IS SUBDUED BEFORE THE LORD; THEN AFTER THAT YOU SHALL RETURN AND BE FREE OF OBLIGATION TO THE LORD AND TO ISRAEL AND THIS LAND SHALL BE YOUR POSSESSION BEFORE THE LORD

BUT IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO BEHOLD YOU HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD AND BE SURE YOUR SIN WILL FIND YOU OUT

BUILD CITIES FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES AND FOLDS FOR YOUR SHEEP AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED

 AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN SAID TO MOSES YOUR SERVANTS WILL DO AS MY LORD COMMANDS

OUR LITTLE ONES OUR WIVES OUR LIVESTOCK AND ALL OUR CATTLE SHALL REMAIN THERE IN THE CITIES OF GILEAD BUT YOUR SERVANTS WILL PASS OVER EVERY MAN WHO IS ARMED FOR WAR BEFORE THE LORD TO BATTLE AS MY LORD ORDERS

 SO MOSES GAVE COMMAND CONCERNING THEM TO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST AND TO JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN AND TO THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND MOSES SAID TO THEM IF THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN EVERY MAN WHO IS ARMED TO BATTLE BEFORE THE LORD WILL PASS WITH YOU OVER THE JORDAN AND THE LAND SHALL BE SUBDUED BEFORE YOU THEN YOU SHALL GIVE THEM THE LAND OF GILEAD FOR A POSSESSION

HOWEVER IF THEY WILL NOT PASS OVER WITH YOU ARMED THEY SHALL HAVE POSSESSIONS AMONG YOU IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

 AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN ANSWERED WHAT THE LORD HAS SAID TO YOUR SERVANTS WE WILL DO

WE WILL PASS OVER ARMED BEFORE THE LORD INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN AND THE POSSESSION OF OUR INHERITANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH US BEYOND THE JORDAN

 AND MOSES GAVE TO THEM TO THE PEOPLE OF GAD AND TO THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN AND TO THE HALFTRIBE OF MANASSEH THE SON OF JOSEPH THE KINGDOM OF SIHON KING OF THE AMORITES AND THE KINGDOM OF OG KING OF BASHAN THE LAND AND ITS CITIES WITH THEIR TERRITORIES THE CITIES OF THE LAND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

AND THE PEOPLE OF GAD BUILT DIBON ATAROTH AROER ATROTHSHOPHAN JAZER JOGBEHAH BETHNIMRAH AND BETHHARAN FORTIFIED CITIES AND FOLDS FOR SHEEP

AND THE PEOPLE OF REUBEN BUILT HESHBON ELEALEH KIRIATHAIM NEBO AND BAALMEON THEIR NAMES WERE CHANGED AND SIBMAH

AND THEY GAVE OTHER NAMES TO THE CITIES THAT THEY BUILT

AND THE SONS OF MACHIR THE SON OF MANASSEH WENT TO GILEAD AND CAPTURED IT AND DISPOSSESSED THE AMORITES WHO WERE IN IT

AND MOSES GAVE GILEAD TO MACHIR THE SON OF MANASSEH AND HE SETTLED IN IT

AND JAIR THE SON OF MANASSEH WENT AND CAPTURED THEIR VILLAGES AND CALLED THEM HAVVOTHJAIR

AND NOBAH WENT AND CAPTURED KENATH AND ITS VILLAGES AND CALLED IT NOBAH AFTER HIS OWN NAME

THESE ARE THE STAGES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT BY THEIR COMPANIES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MOSES AND AARON

MOSES WROTE DOWN THEIR STARTING PLACES STAGE BY STAGE BY COMMAND OF THE LORD AND THESE ARE THEIR STAGES ACCORDING TO THEIR STARTING PLACES

THEY SET OUT FROM RAMESES IN THE FIRST MONTH ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH

AND AARON THE PRIEST WENT UP MOUNT HOR AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD AND DIED THERE IN THE FORTIETH YEAR AFTER THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD COME OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH

AND AARON WAS  YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED ON MOUNT HOR

AND THE CANAANITE THE KING OF ARAD WHO LIVED IN THE NEGEB IN THE LAND OF CANAAN HEARD OF THE COMING OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THE AVENGER OF BLOOD SHALL PUT THE MURDERER TO DEATH WHEN HE MEETS HIM

BUT IF HE PUSHED HIM SUDDENLY WITHOUT ENMITY OR HURLED ANYTHING ON HIM WITHOUT LYING IN WAIT OR USED A STONE THAT COULD CAUSE DEATH AND WITHOUT SEEING HIM DROPPED IT ON HIM SO THAT HE DIED THOUGH HE WAS NOT HIS ENEMY AND DID NOT SEEK HIS HARM THEN THE CONGREGATION SHALL JUDGE BETWEEN THE MANSLAYER AND THE AVENGER OF BLOOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE RULES

AND THE CONGREGATION SHALL RESCUE THE MANSLAYER FROM THE HAND OF THE AVENGER OF BLOOD AND THE CONGREGATION SHALL RESTORE HIM TO HIS CITY OF REFUGE TO WHICH HE HAD FLED AND HE SHALL LIVE IN IT UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST WHO WAS ANOINTED WITH THE HOLY OIL

BUT IF THE MANSLAYER SHALL AT ANY TIME GO BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF HIS CITY OF REFUGE TO WHICH HE FLED AND THE AVENGER OF BLOOD FINDS HIM OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF HIS CITY OF REFUGE AND THE AVENGER OF BLOOD KILLS THE MANSLAYER HE SHALL NOT BE GUILTY OF BLOOD

FOR HE MUST REMAIN IN HIS CITY OF REFUGE UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST BUT AFTER THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST THE MANSLAYER MAY RETURN TO THE LAND OF HIS POSSESSION

AND THESE THINGS SHALL BE FOR A STATUTE AND RULE FOR YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS IN ALL YOUR DWELLING PLACES

IF ANYONE KILLS A PERSON THE MURDERER SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH ON THE EVIDENCE OF WITNESSES

BUT NO PERSON SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH ON THE TESTIMONY OF ONE WITNESS

MOREOVER YOU SHALL ACCEPT NO RANSOM FOR THE LIFE OF A MURDERER WHO IS GUILTY OF DEATH BUT HE SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH

AND YOU SHALL ACCEPT NO RANSOM FOR HIM WHO HAS FLED TO HIS CITY OF REFUGE THAT HE MAY RETURN TO DWELL IN THE LAND BEFORE THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST

YOU SHALL NOT POLLUTE THE LAND IN WHICH YOU LIVE FOR BLOOD POLLUTES THE LAND AND NO ATONEMENT CAN BE MADE FOR THE LAND FOR THE BLOOD THAT IS SHED IN IT EXCEPT BY THE BLOOD OF THE ONE WHO SHED IT

YOU SHALL NOT DEFILE THE LAND IN WHICH YOU LIVE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I DWELL FOR I THE LORD DWELL IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE CLAN OF THE PEOPLE OF GILEAD THE SON OF MACHIR SON OF MANASSEH FROM THE CLANS OF THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH CAME NEAR AND SPOKE BEFORE MOSES AND BEFORE THE CHIEFS THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS' HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

THEY SAID THE LORD COMMANDED MY LORD TO GIVE THE LAND FOR INHERITANCE BY LOT TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND MY LORD WAS COMMANDED BY THE LORD TO GIVE THE INHERITANCE OF ZELOPHEHAD OUR BROTHER TO HIS DAUGHTERS

BUT IF THEY ARE MARRIED TO ANY OF THE SONS OF THE OTHER TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEN THEIR INHERITANCE WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE INHERITANCE OF OUR FATHERS AND ADDED TO THE INHERITANCE OF THE TRIBE INTO WHICH THEY MARRY

SO IT WILL BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE LOT OF OUR INHERITANCE

AND WHEN THE JUBILEE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL COMES THEN THEIR INHERITANCE WILL BE ADDED TO THE INHERITANCE OF THE TRIBE INTO WHICH THEY MARRY AND THEIR INHERITANCE WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE INHERITANCE OF THE TRIBE OF OUR FATHERS

 AND MOSES COMMANDED THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD SAYING THE TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF JOSEPH IS RIGHT

THIS IS WHAT THE LORD COMMANDS CONCERNING THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD 'LET THEM MARRY WHOM THEY THINK BEST ONLY THEY SHALL MARRY WITHIN THE CLAN OF THE TRIBE OF THEIR FATHER

THE INHERITANCE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL NOT BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE TRIBE TO ANOTHER FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL HOLD ON TO THE INHERITANCE OF THE TRIBE OF HIS FATHERS

AND EVERY DAUGHTER WHO POSSESSES AN INHERITANCE IN ANY TRIBE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE WIFE TO ONE OF THE CLAN OF THE TRIBE OF HER FATHER SO THAT EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL MAY POSSESS THE INHERITANCE OF HIS FATHERS

SO NO INHERITANCE SHALL BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE TRIBE TO ANOTHER FOR EACH OF THE TRIBES OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL SHALL HOLD ON TO ITS OWN INHERITANCE

' THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES FOR MAHLAH TIRZAH HOGLAH MILCAH AND NOAH THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD WERE MARRIED TO SONS OF THEIR FATHER'S BROTHERS

THEY WERE MARRIED INTO THE CLANS OF THE PEOPLE OF MANASSEH THE SON OF JOSEPH AND THEIR INHERITANCE REMAINED IN THE TRIBE OF THEIR FATHER'S CLAN

THESE ARE THE COMMANDMENTS AND THE RULES THAT THE LORD COMMANDED THROUGH MOSES TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL IN THE PLAINS OF MOAB BY THE JORDAN AT JERICHO

PHILEMONPAUL A PRISONER FOR CHRIST JESUS AND TIMOTHY OUR BROTHERTO PHILEMON OUR BELOVED FELLOW WORKER AND APPHIA OUR SISTER AND ARCHIPPUS OUR FELLOW SOLDIER AND THE CHURCH IN YOUR HOUSE GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST

I THANK MY GOD ALWAYS WHEN I REMEMBER YOU IN MY PRAYERS BECAUSE I HEAR OF YOUR LOVE AND OF THE FAITH THAT YOU HAVE TOWARD THE LORD JESUS AND ALL THE SAINTS AND I PRAY THAT THE SHARING OF YOUR FAITH MAY BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY GOOD THING THAT IS IN US FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST

FOR I HAVE DERIVED MUCH JOY AND COMFORT FROM YOUR LOVE MY BROTHER BECAUSE THE HEARTS OF THE SAINTS HAVE BEEN REFRESHED THROUGH YOU

ACCORDINGLY THOUGH I AM BOLD ENOUGH IN CHRIST TO COMMAND YOU TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED YET FOR LOVE'S SAKE I PREFER TO APPEAL TO YOUI PAUL AN OLD MAN AND NOW A PRISONER ALSO FOR CHRIST JESUS I APPEAL TO YOU FOR MY CHILD ONESIMUS WHOSE FATHER I BECAME IN MY IMPRISONMENT

FORMERLY HE WAS USELESS TO YOU BUT NOW HE IS INDEED USEFUL TO YOU AND TO ME

 I AM SENDING HIM BACK TO YOU SENDING MY VERY HEART

I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO KEEP HIM WITH ME IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT SERVE ME ON YOUR BEHALF DURING MY IMPRISONMENT FOR THE GOSPEL BUT I PREFERRED TO DO NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT IN ORDER THAT YOUR GOODNESS MIGHT NOT BE BY COMPULSION BUT OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL

FOR THIS PERHAPS IS WHY HE WAS PARTED FROM YOU FOR A WHILE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HIM BACK FOREVER NO LONGER AS A SLAVE BUT MORE THAN A SLAVE AS A BELOVED BROTHERESPECIALLY TO ME BUT HOW MUCH MORE TO YOU BOTH IN THE FLESH AND IN THE LORD

SO IF YOU CONSIDER ME YOUR PARTNER RECEIVE HIM AS YOU WOULD RECEIVE ME

IF HE HAS WRONGED YOU AT ALL OR OWES YOU ANYTHING CHARGE THAT TO MY ACCOUNT

I PAUL WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND I WILL REPAY ITTO SAY NOTHING OF YOUR OWING ME EVEN YOUR OWN SELF

YES BROTHER I WANT SOME BENEFIT FROM YOU IN THE LORD

REFRESH MY HEART IN CHRIST

CONFIDENT OF YOUR OBEDIENCE I WRITE TO YOU KNOWING THAT YOU WILL DO EVEN MORE THAN I SAY

AT THE SAME TIME PREPARE A GUEST ROOM FOR ME FOR I AM HOPING THAT THROUGH YOUR PRAYERS I WILL BE GRACIOUSLY GIVEN TO YOU

EPAPHRAS MY FELLOW PRISONER IN CHRIST JESUS SENDS GREETINGS TO YOU AND SO DO MARK ARISTARCHUS DEMAS AND LUKE MY FELLOW WORKERS

THE GRACE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOUR SPIRIT

GALATIANSPAUL AN APOSTLENOT FROM MEN NOR THROUGH MAN BUT THROUGH JESUS CHRIST AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD AND ALL THE BROTHERS WHO ARE WITH METO THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA GRACE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD OUR FATHER AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS TO DELIVER US FROM THE PRESENT EVIL AGE ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF OUR GOD AND FATHER TO WHOM BE THE GLORY FOREVER AND EVER

AMEN

I AM ASTONISHED THAT YOU ARE SO QUICKLY DESERTING HIM WHO CALLED YOU IN THE GRACE OF CHRIST AND ARE TURNING TO A DIFFERENT GOSPEL NOT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER ONE BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO TROUBLE YOU AND WANT TO DISTORT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST

BUT EVEN IF WE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN SHOULD PREACH TO YOU A GOSPEL CONTRARY TO THE ONE WE PREACHED TO YOU LET HIM BE ACCURSED

AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE SO NOW I SAY AGAIN IF ANYONE IS PREACHING TO YOU A GOSPEL CONTRARY TO THE ONE YOU RECEIVED LET HIM BE ACCURSED

FOR AM I NOW SEEKING THE APPROVAL OF MAN OR OF GOD

OR AM I TRYING TO PLEASE MAN

IF I WERE STILL TRYING TO PLEASE MAN I WOULD NOT BE A SERVANT OF CHRIST

FOR I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW BROTHERS THAT THE GOSPEL THAT WAS PREACHED BY ME IS NOT MAN'S GOSPEL

FOR I DID NOT RECEIVE IT FROM ANY MAN NOR WAS I TAUGHT IT BUT I RECEIVED IT THROUGH A REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST

FOR YOU HAVE HEARD OF MY FORMER LIFE IN JUDAISM HOW I PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF GOD VIOLENTLY AND TRIED TO DESTROY IT

AND I WAS ADVANCING IN JUDAISM BEYOND MANY OF MY OWN AGE AMONG MY PEOPLE SO EXTREMELY ZEALOUS WAS I FOR THE TRADITIONS OF MY FATHERS

BUT WHEN HE WHO HAD SET ME APART BEFORE I WAS BORN AND WHO CALLED ME BY HIS GRACE WAS PLEASED TO REVEAL HIS SON TO ME IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT PREACH HIM AMONG THE GENTILES I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY CONSULT WITH ANYONE; NOR DID I GO UP TO JERUSALEM TO THOSE WHO WERE APOSTLES BEFORE ME BUT I WENT AWAY INTO ARABIA AND RETURNED AGAIN TO DAMASCUS

THEN AFTER THREE YEARS I WENT UP TO JERUSALEM TO VISIT CEPHAS AND REMAINED WITH HIM FIFTEEN DAYS

BUT I SAW NONE OF THE OTHER APOSTLES EXCEPT JAMES THE LORD'S BROTHER

IN WHAT I AM WRITING TO YOU BEFORE GOD I DO NOT LIE

 THEN I WENT INTO THE REGIONS OF SYRIA AND CILICIA

AND I WAS STILL UNKNOWN IN PERSON TO THE CHURCHES OF JUDEA THAT ARE IN CHRIST

THEY ONLY WERE HEARING IT SAID HE WHO USED TO PERSECUTE US IS NOW PREACHING THE FAITH HE ONCE TRIED TO DESTROY

 AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD BECAUSE OF ME

THEN AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS I WENT UP AGAIN TO JERUSALEM WITH BARNABAS TAKING TITUS ALONG WITH ME

I WENT UP BECAUSE OF A REVELATION AND SET BEFORE THEM THOUGH PRIVATELY BEFORE THOSE WHO SEEMED INFLUENTIAL THE GOSPEL THAT I PROCLAIM AMONG THE GENTILES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE I WAS NOT RUNNING OR HAD NOT RUN IN VAIN

BUT EVEN TITUS WHO WAS WITH ME WAS NOT FORCED TO BE CIRCUMCISED THOUGH HE WAS A GREEK

YET BECAUSE OF FALSE BROTHERS SECRETLY BROUGHT INWHO SLIPPED IN TO SPY OUT OUR FREEDOM THAT WE HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BRING US INTO SLAVERY TO THEM WE DID NOT YIELD IN SUBMISSION EVEN FOR A MOMENT SO THAT THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL MIGHT BE PRESERVED FOR YOU

AND FROM THOSE WHO SEEMED TO BE INFLUENTIAL WHAT THEY WERE MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME; GOD SHOWS NO PARTIALITYTHOSE I SAY WHO SEEMED INFLUENTIAL ADDED NOTHING TO ME

ON THE CONTRARY WHEN THEY SAW THAT I HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE GOSPEL TO THE UNCIRCUMCISED JUST AS PETER HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE GOSPEL TO THE CIRCUMCISED FOR HE WHO WORKED THROUGH PETER FOR HIS APOSTOLIC MINISTRY TO THE CIRCUMCISED WORKED ALSO THROUGH ME FOR MINE TO THE GENTILES AND WHEN JAMES AND CEPHAS AND JOHN WHO SEEMED TO BE PILLARS PERCEIVED THE GRACE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME THEY GAVE THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP TO BARNABAS AND ME THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE GENTILES AND THEY TO THE CIRCUMCISED

ONLY THEY ASKED US TO REMEMBER THE POOR THE VERY THING I WAS EAGER TO DO

BUT WHEN CEPHAS CAME TO ANTIOCH I OPPOSED HIM TO HIS FACE BECAUSE HE STOOD CONDEMNED

FOR BEFORE CERTAIN MEN CAME FROM JAMES HE WAS EATING WITH THE GENTILES; BUT WHEN THEY CAME HE DREW BACK AND SEPARATED HIMSELF FEARING THE CIRCUMCISION PARTY

AND THE REST OF THE JEWS ACTED HYPOCRITICALLY ALONG WITH HIM SO THAT EVEN BARNABAS WAS LED ASTRAY BY THEIR HYPOCRISY

BUT WHEN I SAW THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS NOT IN STEP WITH THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL I SAID TO CEPHAS BEFORE THEM ALL IF YOU THOUGH A JEW LIVE LIKE A GENTILE AND NOT LIKE A JEW HOW CAN YOU FORCE THE GENTILES TO LIVE LIKE JEWS

 WE OURSELVES ARE JEWS BY BIRTH AND NOT GENTILE SINNERS; YET WE KNOW THAT A PERSON IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY WORKS OF THE LAW BUT THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST SO WE ALSO HAVE BELIEVED IN CHRIST JESUS IN ORDER TO BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN CHRIST AND NOT BY WORKS OF THE LAW BECAUSE BY WORKS OF THE LAW NO ONE WILL BE JUSTIFIED

BUT IF IN OUR ENDEAVOR TO BE JUSTIFIED IN CHRIST WE TOO WERE FOUND TO BE SINNERS IS CHRIST THEN A SERVANT OF SIN

CERTAINLY NOT

FOR IF I REBUILD WHAT I TORE DOWN I PROVE MYSELF TO BE A TRANSGRESSOR

FOR THROUGH THE LAW I DIED TO THE LAW SO THAT I MIGHT LIVE TO GOD

I HAVE BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST

IT IS NO LONGER I WHO LIVE BUT CHRIST WHO LIVES IN ME

AND THE LIFE I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH I LIVE BY FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD WHO LOVED ME AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME

I DO NOT NULLIFY THE GRACE OF GOD FOR IF JUSTIFICATION WERE THROUGH THE LAW THEN CHRIST DIED FOR NO PURPOSE

O FOOLISH GALATIANS

WHO HAS BEWITCHED YOU

IT WAS BEFORE YOUR EYES THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS PUBLICLY PORTRAYED AS CRUCIFIED

LET ME ASK YOU ONLY THIS DID YOU RECEIVE THE SPIRIT BY WORKS OF THE LAW OR BY HEARING WITH FAITH

ARE YOU SO FOOLISH

HAVING BEGUN BY THE SPIRIT ARE YOU NOW BEING PERFECTED BY THE FLESH

DID YOU SUFFER SO MANY THINGS IN VAINIF INDEED IT WAS IN VAIN

DOES HE WHO SUPPLIES THE SPIRIT TO YOU AND WORKS MIRACLES AMONG YOU DO SO BY WORKS OF THE LAW OR BY HEARING WITH FAITH JUST AS ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS

KNOW THEN THAT IT IS THOSE OF FAITH WHO ARE THE SONS OF ABRAHAM

AND THE SCRIPTURE FORESEEING THAT GOD WOULD JUSTIFY THE GENTILES BY FAITH PREACHED THE GOSPEL BEFOREHAND TO ABRAHAM SAYING IN YOU SHALL ALL THE NATIONS BE BLESSED

 SO THEN THOSE WHO ARE OF FAITH ARE BLESSED ALONG WITH ABRAHAM THE MAN OF FAITH

FOR ALL WHO RELY ON WORKS OF THE LAW ARE UNDER A CURSE; FOR IT IS WRITTEN CURSED BE EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW AND DO THEM

 NOW IT IS EVIDENT THAT NO ONE IS JUSTIFIED BEFORE GOD BY THE LAW FOR THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE BY FAITH

 BUT THE LAW IS NOT OF FAITH RATHER THE ONE WHO DOES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM

 CHRIST REDEEMED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW BY BECOMING A CURSE FOR USFOR IT IS WRITTEN CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO IS HANGED ON A TREE SO THAT IN CHRIST JESUS THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM MIGHT COME TO THE GENTILES SO THAT WE MIGHT RECEIVE THE PROMISED SPIRIT THROUGH FAITH

TO GIVE A HUMAN EXAMPLE BROTHERS EVEN WITH A MANMADE COVENANT NO ONE ANNULS IT OR ADDS TO IT ONCE IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED

NOW THE PROMISES WERE MADE TO ABRAHAM AND TO HIS OFFSPRING

IT DOES NOT SAY AND TO OFFSPRINGS REFERRING TO MANY BUT REFERRING TO ONE AND TO YOUR OFFSPRING WHO IS CHRIST

THIS IS WHAT I MEAN THE LAW WHICH CAME  YEARS AFTERWARD DOES NOT ANNUL A COVENANT PREVIOUSLY RATIFIED BY GOD SO AS TO MAKE THE PROMISE VOID

FOR IF THE INHERITANCE COMES BY THE LAW IT NO LONGER COMES BY PROMISE; BUT GOD GAVE IT TO ABRAHAM BY A PROMISE

WHY THEN THE LAW

IT WAS ADDED BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSIONS UNTIL THE OFFSPRING SHOULD COME TO WHOM THE PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE AND IT WAS PUT IN PLACE THROUGH ANGELS BY AN INTERMEDIARY

NOW AN INTERMEDIARY IMPLIES MORE THAN ONE BUT GOD IS ONE

IS THE LAW THEN CONTRARY TO THE PROMISES OF GOD

CERTAINLY NOT

FOR IF A LAW HAD BEEN GIVEN THAT COULD GIVE LIFE THEN RIGHTEOUSNESS WOULD INDEED BE BY THE LAW

BUT THE SCRIPTURE IMPRISONED EVERYTHING UNDER SIN SO THAT THE PROMISE BY FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST MIGHT BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE

NOW BEFORE FAITH CAME WE WERE HELD CAPTIVE UNDER THE LAW IMPRISONED UNTIL THE COMING FAITH WOULD BE REVEALED

SO THEN THE LAW WAS OUR GUARDIAN UNTIL CHRIST CAME IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH

BUT NOW THAT FAITH HAS COME WE ARE NO LONGER UNDER A GUARDIAN FOR IN CHRIST JESUS YOU ARE ALL SONS OF GOD THROUGH FAITH

FOR AS MANY OF YOU AS WERE BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST HAVE PUT ON CHRIST

THERE IS NEITHER JEW NOR GREEK THERE IS NEITHER SLAVE NOR FREE THERE IS NEITHER MALE NOR FEMALE FOR YOU ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS

AND IF YOU ARE CHRIST'S THEN YOU ARE ABRAHAM'S OFFSPRING HEIRS ACCORDING TO PROMISE

I MEAN THAT THE HEIR AS LONG AS HE IS A CHILD IS NO DIFFERENT FROM A SLAVE THOUGH HE IS THE OWNER OF EVERYTHING BUT HE IS UNDER GUARDIANS AND MANAGERS UNTIL THE DATE SET BY HIS FATHER

IN THE SAME WAY WE ALSO WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN WERE ENSLAVED TO THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD

BUT WHEN THE FULLNESS OF TIME HAD COME GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON BORN OF WOMAN BORN UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM THOSE WHO WERE UNDER THE LAW SO THAT WE MIGHT RECEIVE ADOPTION AS SONS

AND BECAUSE YOU ARE SONS GOD HAS SENT THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON INTO OUR HEARTS CRYING ABBA

FATHER

 SO YOU ARE NO LONGER A SLAVE BUT A SON AND IF A SON THEN AN HEIR THROUGH GOD

FORMERLY WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW GOD YOU WERE ENSLAVED TO THOSE THAT BY NATURE ARE NOT GODS

BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME TO KNOW GOD OR RATHER TO BE KNOWN BY GOD HOW CAN YOU TURN BACK AGAIN TO THE WEAK AND WORTHLESS ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD WHOSE SLAVES YOU WANT TO BE ONCE MORE

YOU OBSERVE DAYS AND MONTHS AND SEASONS AND YEARS

I AM AFRAID I MAY HAVE LABORED OVER YOU IN VAIN

BROTHERS I ENTREAT YOU BECOME AS I AM FOR I ALSO HAVE BECOME AS YOU ARE

YOU DID ME NO WRONG

YOU KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE OF A BODILY AILMENT THAT I PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO YOU AT FIRST AND THOUGH MY CONDITION WAS A TRIAL TO YOU YOU DID NOT SCORN OR DESPISE ME BUT RECEIVED ME AS AN ANGEL OF GOD AS CHRIST JESUS

WHAT THEN HAS BECOME OF THE BLESSING YOU FELT

FOR I TESTIFY TO YOU THAT IF POSSIBLE YOU WOULD HAVE GOUGED OUT YOUR EYES AND GIVEN THEM TO ME

HAVE I THEN BECOME YOUR ENEMY BY TELLING YOU THE TRUTH

THEY MAKE MUCH OF YOU BUT FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE

THEY WANT TO SHUT YOU OUT THAT YOU MAY MAKE MUCH OF THEM

IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO BE MADE MUCH OF FOR A GOOD PURPOSE AND NOT ONLY WHEN I AM PRESENT WITH YOU MY LITTLE CHILDREN FOR WHOM I AM AGAIN IN THE ANGUISH OF CHILDBIRTH UNTIL CHRIST IS FORMED IN YOU

I WISH I COULD BE PRESENT WITH YOU NOW AND CHANGE MY TONE FOR I AM PERPLEXED ABOUT YOU

TELL ME YOU WHO DESIRE TO BE UNDER THE LAW DO YOU NOT LISTEN TO THE LAW

FOR IT IS WRITTEN THAT ABRAHAM HAD TWO SONS ONE BY A SLAVE WOMAN AND ONE BY A FREE WOMAN

BUT THE SON OF THE SLAVE WAS BORN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH WHILE THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN WAS BORN THROUGH PROMISE

NOW THIS MAY BE INTERPRETED ALLEGORICALLY THESE WOMEN ARE TWO COVENANTS

ONE IS FROM MOUNT SINAI BEARING CHILDREN FOR SLAVERY; SHE IS HAGAR

NOW HAGAR IS MOUNT SINAI IN ARABIA; SHE CORRESPONDS TO THE PRESENT JERUSALEM FOR SHE IS IN SLAVERY WITH HER CHILDREN

BUT THE JERUSALEM ABOVE IS FREE AND SHE IS OUR MOTHER

FOR IT IS WRITTEN REJOICE O BARREN ONE WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND CRY ALOUD YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR

FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE ONE WILL BE MORE THAN THOSE OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND

 NOW YOU BROTHERS LIKE ISAAC ARE CHILDREN OF PROMISE

BUT JUST AS AT THAT TIME HE WHO WAS BORN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH PERSECUTED HIM WHO WAS BORN ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT SO ALSO IT IS NOW

BUT WHAT DOES THE SCRIPTURE SAY

CAST OUT THE SLAVE WOMAN AND HER SON FOR THE SON OF THE SLAVE WOMAN SHALL NOT INHERIT WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN

 SO BROTHERS WE ARE NOT CHILDREN OF THE SLAVE BUT OF THE FREE WOMAN

FOR FREEDOM CHRIST HAS SET US FREE; STAND FIRM THEREFORE AND DO NOT SUBMIT AGAIN TO A YOKE OF SLAVERY

LOOK I PAUL SAY TO YOU THAT IF YOU ACCEPT CIRCUMCISION CHRIST WILL BE OF NO ADVANTAGE TO YOU

I TESTIFY AGAIN TO EVERY MAN WHO ACCEPTS CIRCUMCISION THAT HE IS OBLIGATED TO KEEP THE WHOLE LAW

YOU ARE SEVERED FROM CHRIST YOU WHO WOULD BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW; YOU HAVE FALLEN AWAY FROM GRACE

FOR THROUGH THE SPIRIT BY FAITH WE OURSELVES EAGERLY WAIT FOR THE HOPE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

FOR IN CHRIST JESUS NEITHER CIRCUMCISION NOR UNCIRCUMCISION COUNTS FOR ANYTHING BUT ONLY FAITH WORKING THROUGH LOVE

YOU WERE RUNNING WELL

WHO HINDERED YOU FROM OBEYING THE TRUTH

THIS PERSUASION IS NOT FROM HIM WHO CALLS YOU

A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENS THE WHOLE LUMP

I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE LORD THAT YOU WILL TAKE NO OTHER VIEW THAN MINE AND THE ONE WHO IS TROUBLING YOU WILL BEAR THE PENALTY WHOEVER HE IS

BUT IF I BROTHERS STILL PREACH CIRCUMCISION WHY AM I STILL BEING PERSECUTED

IN THAT CASE THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS HAS BEEN REMOVED

I WISH THOSE WHO UNSETTLE YOU WOULD EMASCULATE THEMSELVES

FOR YOU WERE CALLED TO FREEDOM BROTHERS

ONLY DO NOT USE YOUR FREEDOM AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FLESH BUT THROUGH LOVE SERVE ONE ANOTHER

FOR THE WHOLE LAW IS FULFILLED IN ONE WORD YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF

 BUT IF YOU BITE AND DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER WATCH OUT THAT YOU ARE NOT CONSUMED BY ONE ANOTHER

BUT I SAY WALK BY THE SPIRIT AND YOU WILL NOT GRATIFY THE DESIRES OF THE FLESH

FOR THE DESIRES OF THE FLESH ARE AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND THE DESIRES OF THE SPIRIT ARE AGAINST THE FLESH FOR THESE ARE OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER TO KEEP YOU FROM DOING THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO

BUT IF YOU ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT YOU ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW

NOW THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE EVIDENT SEXUAL IMMORALITY IMPURITY SENSUALITY IDOLATRY SORCERY ENMITY STRIFE JEALOUSY FITS OF ANGER RIVALRIES DISSENSIONS DIVISIONS ENVY DRUNKENNESS ORGIES AND THINGS LIKE THESE

I WARN YOU AS I WARNED YOU BEFORE THAT THOSE WHO DO SUCH THINGS WILL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD

BUT THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT IS LOVE JOY PEACE PATIENCE KINDNESS GOODNESS FAITHFULNESS GENTLENESS SELFCONTROL; AGAINST SUCH THINGS THERE IS NO LAW

AND THOSE WHO BELONG TO CHRIST JESUS HAVE CRUCIFIED THE FLESH WITH ITS PASSIONS AND DESIRES

IF WE LIVE BY THE SPIRIT LET US ALSO WALK BY THE SPIRIT

LET US NOT BECOME CONCEITED PROVOKING ONE ANOTHER ENVYING ONE ANOTHER

BROTHERS IF ANYONE IS CAUGHT IN ANY TRANSGRESSION YOU WHO ARE SPIRITUAL SHOULD RESTORE HIM IN A SPIRIT OF GENTLENESS

KEEP WATCH ON YOURSELF LEST YOU TOO BE TEMPTED

BEAR ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS AND SO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST

FOR IF ANYONE THINKS HE IS SOMETHING WHEN HE IS NOTHING HE DECEIVES HIMSELF

BUT LET EACH ONE TEST HIS OWN WORK AND THEN HIS REASON TO BOAST WILL BE IN HIMSELF ALONE AND NOT IN HIS NEIGHBOR

FOR EACH WILL HAVE TO BEAR HIS OWN LOAD

ONE WHO IS TAUGHT THE WORD MUST SHARE ALL GOOD THINGS WITH THE ONE WHO TEACHES

DO NOT BE DECEIVED GOD IS NOT MOCKED FOR WHATEVER ONE SOWS THAT WILL HE ALSO REAP

FOR THE ONE WHO SOWS TO HIS OWN FLESH WILL FROM THE FLESH REAP CORRUPTION BUT THE ONE WHO SOWS TO THE SPIRIT WILL FROM THE SPIRIT REAP ETERNAL LIFE

AND LET US NOT GROW WEARY OF DOING GOOD FOR IN DUE SEASON WE WILL REAP IF WE DO NOT GIVE UP

SO THEN AS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY LET US DO GOOD TO EVERYONE AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO ARE OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH

SEE WITH WHAT LARGE LETTERS I AM WRITING TO YOU WITH MY OWN HAND

IT IS THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE A GOOD SHOWING IN THE FLESH WHO WOULD FORCE YOU TO BE CIRCUMCISED AND ONLY IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY NOT BE PERSECUTED FOR THE CROSS OF CHRIST

FOR EVEN THOSE WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED DO NOT THEMSELVES KEEP THE LAW BUT THEY DESIRE TO HAVE YOU CIRCUMCISED THAT THEY MAY BOAST IN YOUR FLESH

BUT FAR BE IT FROM ME TO BOAST EXCEPT IN THE CROSS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BY WHICH THE WORLD HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED TO ME AND I TO THE WORLD

FOR NEITHER CIRCUMCISION COUNTS FOR ANYTHING NOR UNCIRCUMCISION BUT A NEW CREATION

AND AS FOR ALL WHO WALK BY THIS RULE PEACE AND MERCY BE UPON THEM AND UPON THE ISRAEL OF GOD

FROM NOW ON LET NO ONE CAUSE ME TROUBLE FOR I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS

THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOUR SPIRIT BROTHERS

AMEN

 KINGSAFTER THE DEATH OF AHAB MOAB REBELLED AGAINST ISRAEL

NOW AHAZIAH FELL THROUGH THE LATTICE IN HIS UPPER CHAMBER IN SAMARIA AND LAY SICK; SO HE SENT MESSENGERS TELLING THEM GO INQUIRE OF BAALZEBUB THE GOD OF EKRON WHETHER I SHALL RECOVER FROM THIS SICKNESS

 BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO ELIJAH THE TISHBITE ARISE GO UP TO MEET THE MESSENGERS OF THE KING OF SAMARIA AND SAY TO THEM 'IS IT BECAUSE THERE IS NO GOD IN ISRAEL THAT YOU ARE GOING TO INQUIRE OF BAALZEBUB THE GOD OF EKRON

NOW THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD YOU SHALL NOT COME DOWN FROM THE BED TO WHICH YOU HAVE GONE UP BUT YOU SHALL SURELY DIE

' SO ELIJAH WENT

THE MESSENGERS RETURNED TO THE KING AND HE SAID TO THEM WHY HAVE YOU RETURNED

 AND THEY SAID TO HIM THERE CAME A MAN TO MEET US AND SAID TO US 'GO BACK TO THE KING WHO SENT YOU AND SAY TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD IS IT BECAUSE THERE IS NO GOD IN ISRAEL THAT YOU ARE SENDING TO INQUIRE OF BAALZEBUB THE GOD OF EKRON

THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT COME DOWN FROM THE BED TO WHICH YOU HAVE GONE UP BUT YOU SHALL SURELY DIE

' HE SAID TO THEM WHAT KIND OF MAN WAS HE WHO CAME TO MEET YOU AND TOLD YOU THESE THINGS

 THEY ANSWERED HIM HE WORE A GARMENT OF HAIR WITH A BELT OF LEATHER ABOUT HIS WAIST

 AND HE SAID IT IS ELIJAH THE TISHBITE

 THEN THE KING SENT TO HIM A CAPTAIN OF FIFTY MEN WITH HIS FIFTY

HE WENT UP TO ELIJAH WHO WAS SITTING ON THE TOP OF A HILL AND SAID TO HIM O MAN OF GOD THE KING SAYS 'COME DOWN

' BUT ELIJAH ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN OF FIFTY IF I AM A MAN OF GOD LET FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUME YOU AND YOUR FIFTY

 THEN FIRE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUMED HIM AND HIS FIFTY

AGAIN THE KING SENT TO HIM ANOTHER CAPTAIN OF FIFTY MEN WITH HIS FIFTY

AND HE ANSWERED AND SAID TO HIM O MAN OF GOD THIS IS THE KING'S ORDER 'COME DOWN QUICKLY

' BUT ELIJAH ANSWERED THEM IF I AM A MAN OF GOD LET FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUME YOU AND YOUR FIFTY

 THEN THE FIRE OF GOD CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUMED HIM AND HIS FIFTY

AGAIN THE KING SENT THE CAPTAIN OF A THIRD FIFTY WITH HIS FIFTY

AND THE THIRD CAPTAIN OF FIFTY WENT UP AND CAME AND FELL ON HIS KNEES BEFORE ELIJAH AND ENTREATED HIM O MAN OF GOD PLEASE LET MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF THESE FIFTY SERVANTS OF YOURS BE PRECIOUS IN YOUR SIGHT

BEHOLD FIRE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND CONSUMED THE TWO FORMER CAPTAINS OF FIFTY MEN WITH THEIR FIFTIES BUT NOW LET MY LIFE BE PRECIOUS IN YOUR SIGHT

 THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID TO ELIJAH GO DOWN WITH HIM; DO NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM

 SO HE AROSE AND WENT DOWN WITH HIM TO THE KING AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD 'BECAUSE YOU HAVE SENT MESSENGERS TO INQUIRE OF BAALZEBUB THE GOD OF EKRONIS IT BECAUSE THERE IS NO GOD IN ISRAEL TO INQUIRE OF HIS WORD

THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT COME DOWN FROM THE BED TO WHICH YOU HAVE GONE UP BUT YOU SHALL SURELY DIE

' SO HE DIED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT ELIJAH HAD SPOKEN

JEHORAM BECAME KING IN HIS PLACE IN THE SECOND YEAR OF JEHORAM THE SON OF JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH BECAUSE AHAZIAH HAD NO SON

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF AHAZIAH THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

NOW WHEN THE LORD WAS ABOUT TO TAKE ELIJAH UP TO HEAVEN BY A WHIRLWIND ELIJAH AND ELISHA WERE ON THEIR WAY FROM GILGAL

AND ELIJAH SAID TO ELISHA PLEASE STAY HERE FOR THE LORD HAS SENT ME AS FAR AS BETHEL

 BUT ELISHA SAID AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOU YOURSELF LIVE I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU

 SO THEY WENT DOWN TO BETHEL

AND THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS WHO WERE IN BETHEL CAME OUT TO ELISHA AND SAID TO HIM DO YOU KNOW THAT TODAY THE LORD WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR MASTER FROM OVER YOU

 AND HE SAID YES I KNOW IT; KEEP QUIET

 ELIJAH SAID TO HIM ELISHA PLEASE STAY HERE FOR THE LORD HAS SENT ME TO JERICHO

 BUT HE SAID AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOU YOURSELF LIVE I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU

 SO THEY CAME TO JERICHO

THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS WHO WERE AT JERICHO DREW NEAR TO ELISHA AND SAID TO HIM DO YOU KNOW THAT TODAY THE LORD WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR MASTER FROM OVER YOU

 AND HE ANSWERED YES I KNOW IT; KEEP QUIET

 THEN ELIJAH SAID TO HIM PLEASE STAY HERE FOR THE LORD HAS SENT ME TO THE JORDAN

 BUT HE SAID AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOU YOURSELF LIVE I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU

 SO THE TWO OF THEM WENT ON

FIFTY MEN OF THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS ALSO WENT AND STOOD AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM AS THEY BOTH WERE STANDING BY THE JORDAN

THEN ELIJAH TOOK HIS CLOAK AND ROLLED IT UP AND STRUCK THE WATER AND THE WATER WAS PARTED TO THE ONE SIDE AND TO THE OTHER TILL THE TWO OF THEM COULD GO OVER ON DRY GROUND

WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED ELIJAH SAID TO ELISHA ASK WHAT I SHALL DO FOR YOU BEFORE I AM TAKEN FROM YOU

 AND ELISHA SAID PLEASE LET THERE BE A DOUBLE PORTION OF YOUR SPIRIT ON ME

 AND HE SAID YOU HAVE ASKED A HARD THING; YET IF YOU SEE ME AS I AM BEING TAKEN FROM YOU IT SHALL BE SO FOR YOU BUT IF YOU DO NOT SEE ME IT SHALL NOT BE SO

 AND AS THEY STILL WENT ON AND TALKED BEHOLD CHARIOTS OF FIRE AND HORSES OF FIRE SEPARATED THE TWO OF THEM

AND ELIJAH WENT UP BY A WHIRLWIND INTO HEAVEN

AND ELISHA SAW IT AND HE CRIED MY FATHER MY FATHER

THE CHARIOTS OF ISRAEL AND ITS HORSEMEN

 AND HE SAW HIM NO MORE

THEN HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS OWN CLOTHES AND TORE THEM IN TWO PIECES

AND HE TOOK UP THE CLOAK OF ELIJAH THAT HAD FALLEN FROM HIM AND WENT BACK AND STOOD ON THE BANK OF THE JORDAN

THEN HE TOOK THE CLOAK OF ELIJAH THAT HAD FALLEN FROM HIM AND STRUCK THE WATER SAYING WHERE IS THE LORD THE GOD OF ELIJAH

 AND WHEN HE HAD STRUCK THE WATER THE WATER WAS PARTED TO THE ONE SIDE AND TO THE OTHER AND ELISHA WENT OVER

NOW WHEN THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS WHO WERE AT JERICHO SAW HIM OPPOSITE THEM THEY SAID THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH RESTS ON ELISHA

 AND THEY CAME TO MEET HIM AND BOWED TO THE GROUND BEFORE HIM

AND THEY SAID TO HIM BEHOLD NOW THERE ARE WITH YOUR SERVANTS FIFTY STRONG MEN

PLEASE LET THEM GO AND SEEK YOUR MASTER

IT MAY BE THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD HAS CAUGHT HIM UP AND CAST HIM UPON SOME MOUNTAIN OR INTO SOME VALLEY

 AND HE SAID YOU SHALL NOT SEND

 BUT WHEN THEY URGED HIM TILL HE WAS ASHAMED HE SAID SEND

 THEY SENT THEREFORE FIFTY MEN

AND FOR THREE DAYS THEY SOUGHT HIM BUT DID NOT FIND HIM

AND THEY CAME BACK TO HIM WHILE HE WAS STAYING AT JERICHO AND HE SAID TO THEM DID I NOT SAY TO YOU 'DO NOT GO'

 NOW THE MEN OF THE CITY SAID TO ELISHA BEHOLD THE SITUATION OF THIS CITY IS PLEASANT AS MY LORD SEES BUT THE WATER IS BAD AND THE LAND IS UNFRUITFUL

 HE SAID BRING ME A NEW BOWL AND PUT SALT IN IT

 SO THEY BROUGHT IT TO HIM

THEN HE WENT TO THE SPRING OF WATER AND THREW SALT IN IT AND SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD I HAVE HEALED THIS WATER; FROM NOW ON NEITHER DEATH NOR MISCARRIAGE SHALL COME FROM IT

 SO THE WATER HAS BEEN HEALED TO THIS DAY ACCORDING TO THE WORD THAT ELISHA SPOKE

HE WENT UP FROM THERE TO BETHEL AND WHILE HE WAS GOING UP ON THE WAY SOME SMALL BOYS CAME OUT OF THE CITY AND JEERED AT HIM SAYING GO UP YOU BALDHEAD

GO UP YOU BALDHEAD

 AND HE TURNED AROUND AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE CURSED THEM IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

AND TWO SHEBEARS CAME OUT OF THE WOODS AND TORE FORTYTWO OF THE BOYS

FROM THERE HE WENT ON TO MOUNT CARMEL AND FROM THERE HE RETURNED TO SAMARIA

IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH JEHORAM THE SON OF AHAB BECAME KING OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA AND HE REIGNED TWELVE YEARS

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD THOUGH NOT LIKE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR HE PUT AWAY THE PILLAR OF BAAL THAT HIS FATHER HAD MADE

NEVERTHELESS HE CLUNG TO THE SIN OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN; HE DID NOT DEPART FROM IT

NOW MESHA KING OF MOAB WAS A SHEEP BREEDER AND HE HAD TO DELIVER TO THE KING OF ISRAEL  LAMBS AND THE WOOL OF  RAMS

BUT WHEN AHAB DIED THE KING OF MOAB REBELLED AGAINST THE KING OF ISRAEL

SO KING JEHORAM MARCHED OUT OF SAMARIA AT THAT TIME AND MUSTERED ALL ISRAEL

AND HE WENT AND SENT WORD TO JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH THE KING OF MOAB HAS REBELLED AGAINST ME

WILL YOU GO WITH ME TO BATTLE AGAINST MOAB

 AND HE SAID I WILL GO

I AM AS YOU ARE MY PEOPLE AS YOUR PEOPLE MY HORSES AS YOUR HORSES

 THEN HE SAID BY WHICH WAY SHALL WE MARCH

 JEHORAM ANSWERED BY THE WAY OF THE WILDERNESS OF EDOM

 SO THE KING OF ISRAEL WENT WITH THE KING OF JUDAH AND THE KING OF EDOM

AND WHEN THEY HAD MADE A CIRCUITOUS MARCH OF SEVEN DAYS THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE ARMY OR FOR THE ANIMALS THAT FOLLOWED THEM

THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID ALAS

THE LORD HAS CALLED THESE THREE KINGS TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID IS THERE NO PROPHET OF THE LORD HERE THROUGH WHOM WE MAY INQUIRE OF THE LORD

 THEN ONE OF THE KING OF ISRAEL'S SERVANTS ANSWERED ELISHA THE SON OF SHAPHAT IS HERE WHO POURED WATER ON THE HANDS OF ELIJAH

 AND JEHOSHAPHAT SAID THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH HIM

 SO THE KING OF ISRAEL AND JEHOSHAPHAT AND THE KING OF EDOM WENT DOWN TO HIM

AND ELISHA SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU

GO TO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR FATHER AND TO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR MOTHER

 BUT THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID TO HIM NO; IT IS THE LORD WHO HAS CALLED THESE THREE KINGS TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB

 AND ELISHA SAID AS THE LORD OF HOSTS LIVES BEFORE WHOM I STAND WERE IT NOT THAT I HAVE REGARD FOR JEHOSHAPHAT THE KING OF JUDAH I WOULD NEITHER LOOK AT YOU NOR SEE YOU

BUT NOW BRING ME A MUSICIAN

 AND WHEN THE MUSICIAN PLAYED THE HAND OF THE LORD CAME UPON HIM

AND HE SAID THUS SAYS THE LORD 'I WILL MAKE THIS DRY STREAMBED FULL OF POOLS

' FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD 'YOU SHALL NOT SEE WIND OR RAIN BUT THAT STREAMBED SHALL BE FILLED WITH WATER SO THAT YOU SHALL DRINK YOU YOUR LIVESTOCK AND YOUR ANIMALS

' THIS IS A LIGHT THING IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

HE WILL ALSO GIVE THE MOABITES INTO YOUR HAND AND YOU SHALL ATTACK EVERY FORTIFIED CITY AND EVERY CHOICE CITY AND SHALL FELL EVERY GOOD TREE AND STOP UP ALL SPRINGS OF WATER AND RUIN EVERY GOOD PIECE OF LAND WITH STONES

 THE NEXT MORNING ABOUT THE TIME OF OFFERING THE SACRIFICE BEHOLD WATER CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF EDOM TILL THE COUNTRY WAS FILLED WITH WATER

WHEN ALL THE MOABITES HEARD THAT THE KINGS HAD COME UP TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM ALL WHO WERE ABLE TO PUT ON ARMOR FROM THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST WERE CALLED OUT AND WERE DRAWN UP AT THE BORDER

AND WHEN THEY ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN SHONE ON THE WATER THE MOABITES SAW THE WATER OPPOSITE THEM AS RED AS BLOOD

AND THEY SAID THIS IS BLOOD; THE KINGS HAVE SURELY FOUGHT TOGETHER AND STRUCK ONE ANOTHER DOWN

NOW THEN MOAB TO THE SPOIL

 BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE CAMP OF ISRAEL THE ISRAELITES ROSE AND STRUCK THE MOABITES TILL THEY FLED BEFORE THEM

AND THEY WENT FORWARD STRIKING THE MOABITES AS THEY WENT

AND THEY OVERTHREW THE CITIES AND ON EVERY GOOD PIECE OF LAND EVERY MAN THREW A STONE UNTIL IT WAS COVERED

THEY STOPPED EVERY SPRING OF WATER AND FELLED ALL THE GOOD TREES TILL ONLY ITS STONES WERE LEFT IN KIRHARESETH AND THE SLINGERS SURROUNDED AND ATTACKED IT

WHEN THE KING OF MOAB SAW THAT THE BATTLE WAS GOING AGAINST HIM HE TOOK WITH HIM  SWORDSMEN TO BREAK THROUGH OPPOSITE THE KING OF EDOM BUT THEY COULD NOT

THEN HE TOOK HIS OLDEST SON WHO WAS TO REIGN IN HIS PLACE AND OFFERED HIM FOR A BURNT OFFERING ON THE WALL

AND THERE CAME GREAT WRATH AGAINST ISRAEL

AND THEY WITHDREW FROM HIM AND RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND

NOW THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS CRIED TO ELISHA YOUR SERVANT MY HUSBAND IS DEAD AND YOU KNOW THAT YOUR SERVANT FEARED THE LORD BUT THE CREDITOR HAS COME TO TAKE MY TWO CHILDREN TO BE HIS SLAVES

 AND ELISHA SAID TO HER WHAT SHALL I DO FOR YOU

TELL ME; WHAT HAVE YOU IN THE HOUSE

 AND SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT HAS NOTHING IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT A JAR OF OIL

 THEN HE SAID GO OUTSIDE BORROW VESSELS FROM ALL YOUR NEIGHBORS EMPTY VESSELS AND NOT TOO FEW

THEN GO IN AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOURSELF AND YOUR SONS AND POUR INTO ALL THESE VESSELS

AND WHEN ONE IS FULL SET IT ASIDE

 SO SHE WENT FROM HIM AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HERSELF AND HER SONS

AND AS SHE POURED THEY BROUGHT THE VESSELS TO HER

WHEN THE VESSELS WERE FULL SHE SAID TO HER SON BRING ME ANOTHER VESSEL

 AND HE SAID TO HER THERE IS NOT ANOTHER

 THEN THE OIL STOPPED FLOWING

SHE CAME AND TOLD THE MAN OF GOD AND HE SAID GO SELL THE OIL AND PAY YOUR DEBTS AND YOU AND YOUR SONS CAN LIVE ON THE REST

 ONE DAY ELISHA WENT ON TO SHUNEM WHERE A WEALTHY WOMAN LIVED WHO URGED HIM TO EAT SOME FOOD

SO WHENEVER HE PASSED THAT WAY HE WOULD TURN IN THERE TO EAT FOOD

AND SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND BEHOLD NOW I KNOW THAT THIS IS A HOLY MAN OF GOD WHO IS CONTINUALLY PASSING OUR WAY

LET US MAKE A SMALL ROOM ON THE ROOF WITH WALLS AND PUT THERE FOR HIM A BED A TABLE A CHAIR AND A LAMP SO THAT WHENEVER HE COMES TO US HE CAN GO IN THERE

 ONE DAY HE CAME THERE AND HE TURNED INTO THE CHAMBER AND RESTED THERE

AND HE SAID TO GEHAZI HIS SERVANT CALL THIS SHUNAMMITE

 WHEN HE HAD CALLED HER SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM

AND HE SAID TO HIM SAY NOW TO HER 'SEE YOU HAVE TAKEN ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR US; WHAT IS TO BE DONE FOR YOU

WOULD YOU HAVE A WORD SPOKEN ON YOUR BEHALF TO THE KING OR TO THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY

' SHE ANSWERED I DWELL AMONG MY OWN PEOPLE

 AND HE SAID WHAT THEN IS TO BE DONE FOR HER

 GEHAZI ANSWERED WELL SHE HAS NO SON AND HER HUSBAND IS OLD

 HE SAID CALL HER

 AND WHEN HE HAD CALLED HER SHE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY

AND HE SAID AT THIS SEASON ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR YOU SHALL EMBRACE A SON

 AND SHE SAID NO MY LORD O MAN OF GOD; DO NOT LIE TO YOUR SERVANT

 BUT THE WOMAN CONCEIVED AND SHE BORE A SON ABOUT THAT TIME THE FOLLOWING SPRING AS ELISHA HAD SAID TO HER

WHEN THE CHILD HAD GROWN HE WENT OUT ONE DAY TO HIS FATHER AMONG THE REAPERS

AND HE SAID TO HIS FATHER OH MY HEAD MY HEAD

 THE FATHER SAID TO HIS SERVANT CARRY HIM TO HIS MOTHER

 AND WHEN HE HAD LIFTED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO HIS MOTHER THE CHILD SAT ON HER LAP TILL NOON AND THEN HE DIED

AND SHE WENT UP AND LAID HIM ON THE BED OF THE MAN OF GOD AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND WENT OUT

THEN SHE CALLED TO HER HUSBAND AND SAID SEND ME ONE OF THE SERVANTS AND ONE OF THE DONKEYS THAT I MAY QUICKLY GO TO THE MAN OF GOD AND COME BACK AGAIN

 AND HE SAID WHY WILL YOU GO TO HIM TODAY

IT IS NEITHER NEW MOON NOR SABBATH

 SHE SAID ALL IS WELL

 THEN SHE SADDLED THE DONKEY AND SHE SAID TO HER SERVANT URGE THE ANIMAL ON; DO NOT SLACKEN THE PACE FOR ME UNLESS I TELL YOU

 SO SHE SET OUT AND CAME TO THE MAN OF GOD AT MOUNT CARMEL

WHEN THE MAN OF GOD SAW HER COMING HE SAID TO GEHAZI HIS SERVANT LOOK THERE IS THE SHUNAMMITE

RUN AT ONCE TO MEET HER AND SAY TO HER 'IS ALL WELL WITH YOU

IS ALL WELL WITH YOUR HUSBAND

IS ALL WELL WITH THE CHILD

' AND SHE ANSWERED ALL IS WELL

 AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE MOUNTAIN TO THE MAN OF GOD SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIS FEET

AND GEHAZI CAME TO PUSH HER AWAY

BUT THE MAN OF GOD SAID LEAVE HER ALONE FOR SHE IS IN BITTER DISTRESS AND THE LORD HAS HIDDEN IT FROM ME AND HAS NOT TOLD ME

 THEN SHE SAID DID I ASK MY LORD FOR A SON

DID I NOT SAY 'DO NOT DECEIVE ME

' HE SAID TO GEHAZI TIE UP YOUR GARMENT AND TAKE MY STAFF IN YOUR HAND AND GO

IF YOU MEET ANYONE DO NOT GREET HIM AND IF ANYONE GREETS YOU DO NOT REPLY

AND LAY MY STAFF ON THE FACE OF THE CHILD

 THEN THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD SAID AS THE LORD LIVES AND AS YOU YOURSELF LIVE I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU

 SO HE AROSE AND FOLLOWED HER

GEHAZI WENT ON AHEAD AND LAID THE STAFF ON THE FACE OF THE CHILD BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OR SIGN OF LIFE

THEREFORE HE RETURNED TO MEET HIM AND TOLD HIM THE CHILD HAS NOT AWAKENED

 WHEN ELISHA CAME INTO THE HOUSE HE SAW THE CHILD LYING DEAD ON HIS BED

SO HE WENT IN AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND THE TWO OF THEM AND PRAYED TO THE LORD

THEN HE WENT UP AND LAY ON THE CHILD PUTTING HIS MOUTH ON HIS MOUTH HIS EYES ON HIS EYES AND HIS HANDS ON HIS HANDS

AND AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON HIM THE FLESH OF THE CHILD BECAME WARM

THEN HE GOT UP AGAIN AND WALKED ONCE BACK AND FORTH IN THE HOUSE AND WENT UP AND STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON HIM

THE CHILD SNEEZED SEVEN TIMES AND THE CHILD OPENED HIS EYES

THEN HE SUMMONED GEHAZI AND SAID CALL THIS SHUNAMMITE

 SO HE CALLED HER

AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HIM HE SAID PICK UP YOUR SON

 SHE CAME AND FELL AT HIS FEET BOWING TO THE GROUND

THEN SHE PICKED UP HER SON AND WENT OUT

AND ELISHA CAME AGAIN TO GILGAL WHEN THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND

AND AS THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS WERE SITTING BEFORE HIM HE SAID TO HIS SERVANT SET ON THE LARGE POT AND BOIL STEW FOR THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS

 ONE OF THEM WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD TO GATHER HERBS AND FOUND A WILD VINE AND GATHERED FROM IT HIS LAP FULL OF WILD GOURDS AND CAME AND CUT THEM UP INTO THE POT OF STEW NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY WERE

AND THEY POURED OUT SOME FOR THE MEN TO EAT

BUT WHILE THEY WERE EATING OF THE STEW THEY CRIED OUT O MAN OF GOD THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT

 AND THEY COULD NOT EAT IT

HE SAID THEN BRING FLOUR

 AND HE THREW IT INTO THE POT AND SAID POUR SOME OUT FOR THE MEN THAT THEY MAY EAT

 AND THERE WAS NO HARM IN THE POT

A MAN CAME FROM BAALSHALISHAH BRINGING THE MAN OF GOD BREAD OF THE FIRSTFRUITS TWENTY LOAVES OF BARLEY AND FRESH EARS OF GRAIN IN HIS SACK

AND ELISHA SAID GIVE TO THE MEN THAT THEY MAY EAT

 BUT HIS SERVANT SAID HOW CAN I SET THIS BEFORE A HUNDRED MEN

 SO HE REPEATED GIVE THEM TO THE MEN THAT THEY MAY EAT FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD 'THEY SHALL EAT AND HAVE SOME LEFT

' SO HE SET IT BEFORE THEM

AND THEY ATE AND HAD SOME LEFT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

NAAMAN COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF SYRIA WAS A GREAT MAN WITH HIS MASTER AND IN HIGH FAVOR BECAUSE BY HIM THE LORD HAD GIVEN VICTORY TO SYRIA

HE WAS A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR BUT HE WAS A LEPER

NOW THE SYRIANS ON ONE OF THEIR RAIDS HAD CARRIED OFF A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE LAND OF ISRAEL AND SHE WORKED IN THE SERVICE OF NAAMAN'S WIFE

SHE SAID TO HER MISTRESS WOULD THAT MY LORD WERE WITH THE PROPHET WHO IS IN SAMARIA

HE WOULD CURE HIM OF HIS LEPROSY

 SO NAAMAN WENT IN AND TOLD HIS LORD THUS AND SO SPOKE THE GIRL FROM THE LAND OF ISRAEL

 AND THE KING OF SYRIA SAID GO NOW AND I WILL SEND A LETTER TO THE KING OF ISRAEL

SO HE WENT TAKING WITH HIM TEN TALENTS OF SILVER SIX THOUSAND SHEKELS OF GOLD AND TEN CHANGES OF CLOTHES

AND HE BROUGHT THE LETTER TO THE KING OF ISRAEL WHICH READ WHEN THIS LETTER REACHES YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE SENT TO YOU NAAMAN MY SERVANT THAT YOU MAY CURE HIM OF HIS LEPROSY

 AND WHEN THE KING OF ISRAEL READ THE LETTER HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND SAID AM I GOD TO KILL AND TO MAKE ALIVE THAT THIS MAN SENDS WORD TO ME TO CURE A MAN OF HIS LEPROSY

ONLY CONSIDER AND SEE HOW HE IS SEEKING A QUARREL WITH ME

 BUT WHEN ELISHA THE MAN OF GOD HEARD THAT THE KING OF ISRAEL HAD TORN HIS CLOTHES HE SENT TO THE KING SAYING WHY HAVE YOU TORN YOUR CLOTHES

LET HIM COME NOW TO ME THAT HE MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROPHET IN ISRAEL

 SO NAAMAN CAME WITH HIS HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND STOOD AT THE DOOR OF ELISHA'S HOUSE

AND ELISHA SENT A MESSENGER TO HIM SAYING GO AND WASH IN THE JORDAN SEVEN TIMES AND YOUR FLESH SHALL BE RESTORED AND YOU SHALL BE CLEAN

 BUT NAAMAN WAS ANGRY AND WENT AWAY SAYING BEHOLD I THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD SURELY COME OUT TO ME AND STAND AND CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD HIS GOD AND WAVE HIS HAND OVER THE PLACE AND CURE THE LEPER

ARE NOT ABANA AND PHARPAR THE RIVERS OF DAMASCUS BETTER THAN ALL THE WATERS OF ISRAEL

COULD I NOT WASH IN THEM AND BE CLEAN

 SO HE TURNED AND WENT AWAY IN A RAGE

BUT HIS SERVANTS CAME NEAR AND SAID TO HIM MY FATHER IT IS A GREAT WORD THE PROPHET HAS SPOKEN TO YOU; WILL YOU NOT DO IT

HAS HE ACTUALLY SAID TO YOU 'WASH AND BE CLEAN'

 SO HE WENT DOWN AND DIPPED HIMSELF SEVEN TIMES IN THE JORDAN ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE MAN OF GOD AND HIS FLESH WAS RESTORED LIKE THE FLESH OF A LITTLE CHILD AND HE WAS CLEAN

THEN HE RETURNED TO THE MAN OF GOD HE AND ALL HIS COMPANY AND HE CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM

AND HE SAID BEHOLD I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO GOD IN ALL THE EARTH BUT IN ISRAEL; SO ACCEPT NOW A PRESENT FROM YOUR SERVANT

 BUT HE SAID AS THE LORD LIVES BEFORE WHOM I STAND I WILL RECEIVE NONE

 AND HE URGED HIM TO TAKE IT BUT HE REFUSED

THEN NAAMAN SAID IF NOT PLEASE LET THERE BE GIVEN TO YOUR SERVANT TWO MULES' LOAD OF EARTH FOR FROM NOW ON YOUR SERVANT WILL NOT OFFER BURNT OFFERING OR SACRIFICE TO ANY GOD BUT THE LORD

IN THIS MATTER MAY THE LORD PARDON YOUR SERVANT WHEN MY MASTER GOES INTO THE HOUSE OF RIMMON TO WORSHIP THERE LEANING ON MY ARM AND I BOW MYSELF IN THE HOUSE OF RIMMON WHEN I BOW MYSELF IN THE HOUSE OF RIMMON THE LORD PARDON YOUR SERVANT IN THIS MATTER

 HE SAID TO HIM GO IN PEACE

BUT WHEN NAAMAN HAD GONE FROM HIM A SHORT DISTANCE GEHAZI THE SERVANT OF ELISHA THE MAN OF GOD SAID SEE MY MASTER HAS SPARED THIS NAAMAN THE SYRIAN IN NOT ACCEPTING FROM HIS HAND WHAT HE BROUGHT

AS THE LORD LIVES I WILL RUN AFTER HIM AND GET SOMETHING FROM HIM

 SO GEHAZI FOLLOWED NAAMAN

AND WHEN NAAMAN SAW SOMEONE RUNNING AFTER HIM HE GOT DOWN FROM THE CHARIOT TO MEET HIM AND SAID IS ALL WELL

 AND HE SAID ALL IS WELL

MY MASTER HAS SENT ME TO SAY 'THERE HAVE JUST NOW COME TO ME FROM THE HILL COUNTRY OF EPHRAIM TWO YOUNG MEN OF THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS

PLEASE GIVE THEM A TALENT OF SILVER AND TWO FESTAL GARMENTS

' AND NAAMAN SAID BE PLEASED TO ACCEPT TWO TALENTS

 AND HE URGED HIM AND TIED UP TWO TALENTS OF SILVER IN TWO BAGS WITH TWO FESTAL GARMENTS AND LAID THEM ON TWO OF HIS SERVANTS

AND THEY CARRIED THEM BEFORE GEHAZI

AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE HILL HE TOOK THEM FROM THEIR HAND AND PUT THEM IN THE HOUSE AND HE SENT THE MEN AWAY AND THEY DEPARTED

HE WENT IN AND STOOD BEFORE HIS MASTER AND ELISHA SAID TO HIM WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN GEHAZI

 AND HE SAID YOUR SERVANT WENT NOWHERE

 BUT HE SAID TO HIM DID NOT MY HEART GO WHEN THE MAN TURNED FROM HIS CHARIOT TO MEET YOU

WAS IT A TIME TO ACCEPT MONEY AND GARMENTS OLIVE ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS SHEEP AND OXEN MALE SERVANTS AND FEMALE SERVANTS

THEREFORE THE LEPROSY OF NAAMAN SHALL CLING TO YOU AND TO YOUR DESCENDANTS FOREVER

 SO HE WENT OUT FROM HIS PRESENCE A LEPER LIKE SNOW

NOW THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS SAID TO ELISHA SEE THE PLACE WHERE WE DWELL UNDER YOUR CHARGE IS TOO SMALL FOR US

LET US GO TO THE JORDAN AND EACH OF US GET THERE A LOG AND LET US MAKE A PLACE FOR US TO DWELL THERE

 AND HE ANSWERED GO

 THEN ONE OF THEM SAID BE PLEASED TO GO WITH YOUR SERVANTS

 AND HE ANSWERED I WILL GO

 SO HE WENT WITH THEM

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE JORDAN THEY CUT DOWN TREES

BUT AS ONE WAS FELLING A LOG HIS AXE HEAD FELL INTO THE WATER AND HE CRIED OUT ALAS MY MASTER

IT WAS BORROWED

 THEN THE MAN OF GOD SAID WHERE DID IT FALL

 WHEN HE SHOWED HIM THE PLACE HE CUT OFF A STICK AND THREW IT IN THERE AND MADE THE IRON FLOAT

AND HE SAID TAKE IT UP

 SO HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK IT

ONCE WHEN THE KING OF SYRIA WAS WARRING AGAINST ISRAEL HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH HIS SERVANTS SAYING AT SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE SHALL BE MY CAMP

 BUT THE MAN OF GOD SENT WORD TO THE KING OF ISRAEL BEWARE THAT YOU DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE FOR THE SYRIANS ARE GOING DOWN THERE

 AND THE KING OF ISRAEL SENT TO THE PLACE ABOUT WHICH THE MAN OF GOD TOLD HIM

THUS HE USED TO WARN HIM SO THAT HE SAVED HIMSELF THERE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE

AND THE MIND OF THE KING OF SYRIA WAS GREATLY TROUBLED BECAUSE OF THIS THING AND HE CALLED HIS SERVANTS AND SAID TO THEM WILL YOU NOT SHOW ME WHO OF US IS FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL

 AND ONE OF HIS SERVANTS SAID NONE MY LORD O KING; BUT ELISHA THE PROPHET WHO IS IN ISRAEL TELLS THE KING OF ISRAEL THE WORDS THAT YOU SPEAK IN YOUR BEDROOM

 AND HE SAID GO AND SEE WHERE HE IS THAT I MAY SEND AND SEIZE HIM

 IT WAS TOLD HIM BEHOLD HE IS IN DOTHAN

 SO HE SENT THERE HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND A GREAT ARMY AND THEY CAME BY NIGHT AND SURROUNDED THE CITY

WHEN THE SERVANT OF THE MAN OF GOD ROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WENT OUT BEHOLD AN ARMY WITH HORSES AND CHARIOTS WAS ALL AROUND THE CITY

AND THE SERVANT SAID ALAS MY MASTER

WHAT SHALL WE DO

 HE SAID DO NOT BE AFRAID FOR THOSE WHO ARE WITH US ARE MORE THAN THOSE WHO ARE WITH THEM

 THEN ELISHA PRAYED AND SAID O LORD PLEASE OPEN HIS EYES THAT HE MAY SEE

 SO THE LORD OPENED THE EYES OF THE YOUNG MAN AND HE SAW AND BEHOLD THE MOUNTAIN WAS FULL OF HORSES AND CHARIOTS OF FIRE ALL AROUND ELISHA

AND WHEN THE SYRIANS CAME DOWN AGAINST HIM ELISHA PRAYED TO THE LORD AND SAID PLEASE STRIKE THIS PEOPLE WITH BLINDNESS

 SO HE STRUCK THEM WITH BLINDNESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRAYER OF ELISHA

AND ELISHA SAID TO THEM THIS IS NOT THE WAY AND THIS IS NOT THE CITY

FOLLOW ME AND I WILL BRING YOU TO THE MAN WHOM YOU SEEK

 AND HE LED THEM TO SAMARIA

AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED SAMARIA ELISHA SAID O LORD OPEN THE EYES OF THESE MEN THAT THEY MAY SEE

 SO THE LORD OPENED THEIR EYES AND THEY SAW AND BEHOLD THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF SAMARIA

AS SOON AS THE KING OF ISRAEL SAW THEM HE SAID TO ELISHA MY FATHER SHALL I STRIKE THEM DOWN

SHALL I STRIKE THEM DOWN

 HE ANSWERED YOU SHALL NOT STRIKE THEM DOWN

WOULD YOU STRIKE DOWN THOSE WHOM YOU HAVE TAKEN CAPTIVE WITH YOUR SWORD AND WITH YOUR BOW

SET BREAD AND WATER BEFORE THEM THAT THEY MAY EAT AND DRINK AND GO TO THEIR MASTER

 SO HE PREPARED FOR THEM A GREAT FEAST AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNK HE SENT THEM AWAY AND THEY WENT TO THEIR MASTER

AND THE SYRIANS DID NOT COME AGAIN ON RAIDS INTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL

AFTERWARD BENHADAD KING OF SYRIA MUSTERED HIS ENTIRE ARMY AND WENT UP AND BESIEGED SAMARIA

AND THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN SAMARIA AS THEY BESIEGED IT UNTIL A DONKEY'S HEAD WAS SOLD FOR EIGHTY SHEKELS OF SILVER AND THE FOURTH PART OF A KAB OF DOVE'S DUNG FOR FIVE SHEKELS OF SILVER

NOW AS THE KING OF ISRAEL WAS PASSING BY ON THE WALL A WOMAN CRIED OUT TO HIM SAYING HELP MY LORD O KING

 AND HE SAID IF THE LORD WILL NOT HELP YOU HOW SHALL I HELP YOU

FROM THE THRESHING FLOOR OR FROM THE WINEPRESS

 AND THE KING ASKED HER WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE

 SHE ANSWERED THIS WOMAN SAID TO ME 'GIVE YOUR SON THAT WE MAY EAT HIM TODAY AND WE WILL EAT MY SON TOMORROW

' SO WE BOILED MY SON AND ATE HIM

AND ON THE NEXT DAY I SAID TO HER 'GIVE YOUR SON THAT WE MAY EAT HIM

' BUT SHE HAS HIDDEN HER SON

 WHEN THE KING HEARD THE WORDS OF THE WOMAN HE TORE HIS CLOTHESNOW HE WAS PASSING BY ON THE WALLAND THE PEOPLE LOOKED AND BEHOLD HE HAD SACKCLOTH BENEATH ON HIS BODY AND HE SAID MAY GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF THE HEAD OF ELISHA THE SON OF SHAPHAT REMAINS ON HIS SHOULDERS TODAY

 ELISHA WAS SITTING IN HIS HOUSE AND THE ELDERS WERE SITTING WITH HIM

NOW THE KING HAD DISPATCHED A MAN FROM HIS PRESENCE BUT BEFORE THE MESSENGER ARRIVED ELISHA SAID TO THE ELDERS DO YOU SEE HOW THIS MURDERER HAS SENT TO TAKE OFF MY HEAD

LOOK WHEN THE MESSENGER COMES SHUT THE DOOR AND HOLD THE DOOR FAST AGAINST HIM

IS NOT THE SOUND OF HIS MASTER'S FEET BEHIND HIM

 AND WHILE HE WAS STILL SPEAKING WITH THEM THE MESSENGER CAME DOWN TO HIM AND SAID THIS TROUBLE IS FROM THE LORD

WHY SHOULD I WAIT FOR THE LORD ANY LONGER

BUT ELISHA SAID HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD THUS SAYS THE LORD TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME A SEAH OF FINE FLOUR SHALL BE SOLD FOR A SHEKEL AND TWO SEAHS OF BARLEY FOR A SHEKEL AT THE GATE OF SAMARIA

 THEN THE CAPTAIN ON WHOSE HAND THE KING LEANED SAID TO THE MAN OF GOD IF THE LORD HIMSELF SHOULD MAKE WINDOWS IN HEAVEN COULD THIS THING BE

 BUT HE SAID YOU SHALL SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES BUT YOU SHALL NOT EAT OF IT

 NOW THERE WERE FOUR MEN WHO WERE LEPERS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE GATE

AND THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE UNTIL WE DIE

IF WE SAY 'LET US ENTER THE CITY' THE FAMINE IS IN THE CITY AND WE SHALL DIE THERE

AND IF WE SIT HERE WE DIE ALSO

SO NOW COME LET US GO OVER TO THE CAMP OF THE SYRIANS

IF THEY SPARE OUR LIVES WE SHALL LIVE AND IF THEY KILL US WE SHALL BUT DIE

 SO THEY AROSE AT TWILIGHT TO GO TO THE CAMP OF THE SYRIANS

BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE CAMP OF THE SYRIANS BEHOLD THERE WAS NO ONE THERE

FOR THE LORD HAD MADE THE ARMY OF THE SYRIANS HEAR THE SOUND OF CHARIOTS AND OF HORSES THE SOUND OF A GREAT ARMY SO THAT THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER BEHOLD THE KING OF ISRAEL HAS HIRED AGAINST US THE KINGS OF THE HITTITES AND THE KINGS OF EGYPT TO COME AGAINST US

 SO THEY FLED AWAY IN THE TWILIGHT AND ABANDONED THEIR TENTS THEIR HORSES AND THEIR DONKEYS LEAVING THE CAMP AS IT WAS AND FLED FOR THEIR LIVES

AND WHEN THESE LEPERS CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE CAMP THEY WENT INTO A TENT AND ATE AND DRANK AND THEY CARRIED OFF SILVER AND GOLD AND CLOTHING AND WENT AND HID THEM

THEN THEY CAME BACK AND ENTERED ANOTHER TENT AND CARRIED OFF THINGS FROM IT AND WENT AND HID THEM

THEN THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER WE ARE NOT DOING RIGHT

THIS DAY IS A DAY OF GOOD NEWS

IF WE ARE SILENT AND WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING LIGHT PUNISHMENT WILL OVERTAKE US

NOW THEREFORE COME; LET US GO AND TELL THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD

 SO THEY CAME AND CALLED TO THE GATEKEEPERS OF THE CITY AND TOLD THEM WE CAME TO THE CAMP OF THE SYRIANS AND BEHOLD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN OR HEARD THERE NOTHING BUT THE HORSES TIED AND THE DONKEYS TIED AND THE TENTS AS THEY WERE

 THEN THE GATEKEEPERS CALLED OUT AND IT WAS TOLD WITHIN THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD

AND THE KING ROSE IN THE NIGHT AND SAID TO HIS SERVANTS I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE SYRIANS HAVE DONE TO US

THEY KNOW THAT WE ARE HUNGRY

THEREFORE THEY HAVE GONE OUT OF THE CAMP TO HIDE THEMSELVES IN THE OPEN COUNTRY THINKING 'WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE CITY WE SHALL TAKE THEM ALIVE AND GET INTO THE CITY

' AND ONE OF HIS SERVANTS SAID LET SOME MEN TAKE FIVE OF THE REMAINING HORSES SEEING THAT THOSE WHO ARE LEFT HERE WILL FARE LIKE THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF ISRAEL WHO HAVE ALREADY PERISHED

LET US SEND AND SEE

 SO THEY TOOK TWO HORSEMEN AND THE KING SENT THEM AFTER THE ARMY OF THE SYRIANS SAYING GO AND SEE

 SO THEY WENT AFTER THEM AS FAR AS THE JORDAN AND BEHOLD ALL THE WAY WAS LITTERED WITH GARMENTS AND EQUIPMENT THAT THE SYRIANS HAD THROWN AWAY IN THEIR HASTE

AND THE MESSENGERS RETURNED AND TOLD THE KING

THEN THE PEOPLE WENT OUT AND PLUNDERED THE CAMP OF THE SYRIANS

SO A SEAH OF FINE FLOUR WAS SOLD FOR A SHEKEL AND TWO SEAHS OF BARLEY FOR A SHEKEL ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD

NOW THE KING HAD APPOINTED THE CAPTAIN ON WHOSE HAND HE LEANED TO HAVE CHARGE OF THE GATE

AND THE PEOPLE TRAMPLED HIM IN THE GATE SO THAT HE DIED AS THE MAN OF GOD HAD SAID WHEN THE KING CAME DOWN TO HIM

FOR WHEN THE MAN OF GOD HAD SAID TO THE KING TWO SEAHS OF BARLEY SHALL BE SOLD FOR A SHEKEL AND A SEAH OF FINE FLOUR FOR A SHEKEL ABOUT THIS TIME TOMORROW IN THE GATE OF SAMARIA THE CAPTAIN HAD ANSWERED THE MAN OF GOD IF THE LORD HIMSELF SHOULD MAKE WINDOWS IN HEAVEN COULD SUCH A THING BE

 AND HE HAD SAID YOU SHALL SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES BUT YOU SHALL NOT EAT OF IT

 AND SO IT HAPPENED TO HIM FOR THE PEOPLE TRAMPLED HIM IN THE GATE AND HE DIED

NOW ELISHA HAD SAID TO THE WOMAN WHOSE SON HE HAD RESTORED TO LIFE ARISE AND DEPART WITH YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND SOJOURN WHEREVER YOU CAN FOR THE LORD HAS CALLED FOR A FAMINE AND IT WILL COME UPON THE LAND FOR SEVEN YEARS

 SO THE WOMAN AROSE AND DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE MAN OF GOD

SHE WENT WITH HER HOUSEHOLD AND SOJOURNED IN THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES SEVEN YEARS

AND AT THE END OF THE SEVEN YEARS WHEN THE WOMAN RETURNED FROM THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES SHE WENT TO APPEAL TO THE KING FOR HER HOUSE AND HER LAND

NOW THE KING WAS TALKING WITH GEHAZI THE SERVANT OF THE MAN OF GOD SAYING TELL ME ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT ELISHA HAS DONE

 AND WHILE HE WAS TELLING THE KING HOW ELISHA HAD RESTORED THE DEAD TO LIFE BEHOLD THE WOMAN WHOSE SON HE HAD RESTORED TO LIFE APPEALED TO THE KING FOR HER HOUSE AND HER LAND

AND GEHAZI SAID MY LORD O KING HERE IS THE WOMAN AND HERE IS HER SON WHOM ELISHA RESTORED TO LIFE

 AND WHEN THE KING ASKED THE WOMAN SHE TOLD HIM

SO THE KING APPOINTED AN OFFICIAL FOR HER SAYING RESTORE ALL THAT WAS HERS TOGETHER WITH ALL THE PRODUCE OF THE FIELDS FROM THE DAY THAT SHE LEFT THE LAND UNTIL NOW

 NOW ELISHA CAME TO DAMASCUS

BENHADAD THE KING OF SYRIA WAS SICK

AND WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM THE MAN OF GOD HAS COME HERE THE KING SAID TO HAZAEL TAKE A PRESENT WITH YOU AND GO TO MEET THE MAN OF GOD AND INQUIRE OF THE LORD THROUGH HIM SAYING 'SHALL I RECOVER FROM THIS SICKNESS

' SO HAZAEL WENT TO MEET HIM AND TOOK A PRESENT WITH HIM ALL KINDS OF GOODS OF DAMASCUS FORTY CAMEL LOADS

WHEN HE CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM HE SAID YOUR SON BENHADAD KING OF SYRIA HAS SENT ME TO YOU SAYING 'SHALL I RECOVER FROM THIS SICKNESS

' AND ELISHA SAID TO HIM GO SAY TO HIM 'YOU SHALL CERTAINLY RECOVER' BUT THE LORD HAS SHOWN ME THAT HE SHALL CERTAINLY DIE

 AND HE FIXED HIS GAZE AND STARED AT HIM UNTIL HE WAS EMBARRASSED

AND THE MAN OF GOD WEPT

AND HAZAEL SAID WHY DOES MY LORD WEEP

 HE ANSWERED BECAUSE I KNOW THE EVIL THAT YOU WILL DO TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

YOU WILL SET ON FIRE THEIR FORTRESSES AND YOU WILL KILL THEIR YOUNG MEN WITH THE SWORD AND DASH IN PIECES THEIR LITTLE ONES AND RIP OPEN THEIR PREGNANT WOMEN

 AND HAZAEL SAID WHAT IS YOUR SERVANT WHO IS BUT A DOG THAT HE SHOULD DO THIS GREAT THING

 ELISHA ANSWERED THE LORD HAS SHOWN ME THAT YOU ARE TO BE KING OVER SYRIA

 THEN HE DEPARTED FROM ELISHA AND CAME TO HIS MASTER WHO SAID TO HIM WHAT DID ELISHA SAY TO YOU

 AND HE ANSWERED HE TOLD ME THAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY RECOVER

 BUT THE NEXT DAY HE TOOK THE BED CLOTH AND DIPPED IT IN WATER AND SPREAD IT OVER HIS FACE TILL HE DIED

AND HAZAEL BECAME KING IN HIS PLACE

IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF JORAM THE SON OF AHAB KING OF ISRAEL WHEN JEHOSHAPHAT WAS KING OF JUDAH JEHORAM THE SON OF JEHOSHAPHAT KING OF JUDAH BEGAN TO REIGN

HE WAS THIRTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING AND HE REIGNED EIGHT YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE FOR THE DAUGHTER OF AHAB WAS HIS WIFE

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

YET THE LORD WAS NOT WILLING TO DESTROY JUDAH FOR THE SAKE OF DAVID HIS SERVANT SINCE HE PROMISED TO GIVE A LAMP TO HIM AND TO HIS SONS FOREVER

IN HIS DAYS EDOM REVOLTED FROM THE RULE OF JUDAH AND SET UP A KING OF THEIR OWN

THEN JORAM PASSED OVER TO ZAIR WITH ALL HIS CHARIOTS AND ROSE BY NIGHT AND HE AND HIS CHARIOT COMMANDERS STRUCK THE EDOMITES WHO HAD SURROUNDED HIM BUT HIS ARMY FLED HOME

SO EDOM REVOLTED FROM THE RULE OF JUDAH TO THIS DAY

THEN LIBNAH REVOLTED AT THE SAME TIME

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JORAM AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

SO JORAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND AHAZIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE TWELFTH YEAR OF JORAM THE SON OF AHAB KING OF ISRAEL AHAZIAH THE SON OF JEHORAM KING OF JUDAH BEGAN TO REIGN

AHAZIAH WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED ONE YEAR IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ATHALIAH; SHE WAS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF OMRI KING OF ISRAEL

HE ALSO WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE FOR HE WAS SONINLAW TO THE HOUSE OF AHAB

HE WENT WITH JORAM THE SON OF AHAB TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA AT RAMOTHGILEAD AND THE SYRIANS WOUNDED JORAM

AND KING JORAM RETURNED TO BE HEALED IN JEZREEL OF THE WOUNDS THAT THE SYRIANS HAD GIVEN HIM AT RAMAH WHEN HE FOUGHT AGAINST HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA

AND AHAZIAH THE SON OF JEHORAM KING OF JUDAH WENT DOWN TO SEE JORAM THE SON OF AHAB IN JEZREEL BECAUSE HE WAS SICK

THEN ELISHA THE PROPHET CALLED ONE OF THE SONS OF THE PROPHETS AND SAID TO HIM TIE UP YOUR GARMENTS AND TAKE THIS FLASK OF OIL IN YOUR HAND AND GO TO RAMOTHGILEAD

AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE LOOK THERE FOR JEHU THE SON OF JEHOSHAPHAT SON OF NIMSHI

AND GO IN AND HAVE HIM RISE FROM AMONG HIS FELLOWS AND LEAD HIM TO AN INNER CHAMBER

THEN TAKE THE FLASK OF OIL AND POUR IT ON HIS HEAD AND SAY 'THUS SAYS THE LORD I ANOINT YOU KING OVER ISRAEL

' THEN OPEN THE DOOR AND FLEE; DO NOT LINGER

 SO THE YOUNG MAN THE SERVANT OF THE PROPHET WENT TO RAMOTHGILEAD

AND WHEN HE CAME BEHOLD THE COMMANDERS OF THE ARMY WERE IN COUNCIL

AND HE SAID I HAVE A WORD FOR YOU O COMMANDER

 AND JEHU SAID TO WHICH OF US ALL

 AND HE SAID TO YOU O COMMANDER

 SO HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE

AND THE YOUNG MAN POURED THE OIL ON HIS HEAD SAYING TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL I ANOINT YOU KING OVER THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD OVER ISRAEL

AND YOU SHALL STRIKE DOWN THE HOUSE OF AHAB YOUR MASTER SO THAT I MAY AVENGE ON JEZEBEL THE BLOOD OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND THE BLOOD OF ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD

FOR THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AHAB SHALL PERISH AND I WILL CUT OFF FROM AHAB EVERY MALE BOND OR FREE IN ISRAEL

AND I WILL MAKE THE HOUSE OF AHAB LIKE THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT AND LIKE THE HOUSE OF BAASHA THE SON OF AHIJAH

AND THE DOGS SHALL EAT JEZEBEL IN THE TERRITORY OF JEZREEL AND NONE SHALL BURY HER

 THEN HE OPENED THE DOOR AND FLED

WHEN JEHU CAME OUT TO THE SERVANTS OF HIS MASTER THEY SAID TO HIM IS ALL WELL

WHY DID THIS MAD FELLOW COME TO YOU

 AND HE SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW THE FELLOW AND HIS TALK

 AND THEY SAID THAT IS NOT TRUE; TELL US NOW

 AND HE SAID THUS AND SO HE SPOKE TO ME SAYING 'THUS SAYS THE LORD I ANOINT YOU KING OVER ISRAEL

' THEN IN HASTE EVERY MAN OF THEM TOOK HIS GARMENT AND PUT IT UNDER HIM ON THE BARE STEPS AND THEY BLEW THE TRUMPET AND PROCLAIMED JEHU IS KING

 THUS JEHU THE SON OF JEHOSHAPHAT THE SON OF NIMSHI CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM

NOW JORAM WITH ALL ISRAEL HAD BEEN ON GUARD AT RAMOTHGILEAD AGAINST HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA BUT KING JORAM HAD RETURNED TO BE HEALED IN JEZREEL OF THE WOUNDS THAT THE SYRIANS HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN HE FOUGHT WITH HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA

 SO JEHU SAID IF THIS IS YOUR DECISION THEN LET NO ONE SLIP OUT OF THE CITY TO GO AND TELL THE NEWS IN JEZREEL

 THEN JEHU MOUNTED HIS CHARIOT AND WENT TO JEZREEL FOR JORAM LAY THERE

AND AHAZIAH KING OF JUDAH HAD COME DOWN TO VISIT JORAM

NOW THE WATCHMAN WAS STANDING ON THE TOWER IN JEZREEL AND HE SAW THE COMPANY OF JEHU AS HE CAME AND SAID I SEE A COMPANY

 AND JORAM SAID TAKE A HORSEMAN AND SEND TO MEET THEM AND LET HIM SAY 'IS IT PEACE

' SO A MAN ON HORSEBACK WENT TO MEET HIM AND SAID THUS SAYS THE KING 'IS IT PEACE

' AND JEHU SAID WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO WITH PEACE

TURN AROUND AND RIDE BEHIND ME

 AND THE WATCHMAN REPORTED SAYING THE MESSENGER REACHED THEM BUT HE IS NOT COMING BACK

 THEN HE SENT OUT A SECOND HORSEMAN WHO CAME TO THEM AND SAID THUS THE KING HAS SAID 'IS IT PEACE

' AND JEHU ANSWERED WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO WITH PEACE

TURN AROUND AND RIDE BEHIND ME

 AGAIN THE WATCHMAN REPORTED HE REACHED THEM BUT HE IS NOT COMING BACK

AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVES FURIOUSLY

 JORAM SAID MAKE READY

 AND THEY MADE READY HIS CHARIOT

THEN JORAM KING OF ISRAEL AND AHAZIAH KING OF JUDAH SET OUT EACH IN HIS CHARIOT AND WENT TO MEET JEHU AND MET HIM AT THE PROPERTY OF NABOTH THE JEZREELITE

AND WHEN JORAM SAW JEHU HE SAID IS IT PEACE JEHU

 HE ANSWERED WHAT PEACE CAN THERE BE SO LONG AS THE WHORINGS AND THE SORCERIES OF YOUR MOTHER JEZEBEL ARE SO MANY

 THEN JORAM REINED ABOUT AND FLED SAYING TO AHAZIAH TREACHERY O AHAZIAH

 AND JEHU DREW HIS BOW WITH HIS FULL STRENGTH AND SHOT JORAM BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS SO THAT THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND HE SANK IN HIS CHARIOT

JEHU SAID TO BIDKAR HIS AIDE TAKE HIM UP AND THROW HIM ON THE PLOT OF GROUND BELONGING TO NABOTH THE JEZREELITE

FOR REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND I RODE SIDE BY SIDE BEHIND AHAB HIS FATHER HOW THE LORD MADE THIS PRONOUNCEMENT AGAINST HIM 'AS SURELY AS I SAW YESTERDAY THE BLOOD OF NABOTH AND THE BLOOD OF HIS SONSDECLARES THE LORDI WILL REPAY YOU ON THIS PLOT OF GROUND

' NOW THEREFORE TAKE HIM UP AND THROW HIM ON THE PLOT OF GROUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WORD OF THE LORD

 WHEN AHAZIAH THE KING OF JUDAH SAW THIS HE FLED IN THE DIRECTION OF BETHHAGGAN

AND JEHU PURSUED HIM AND SAID SHOOT HIM ALSO

 AND THEY SHOT HIM IN THE CHARIOT AT THE ASCENT OF GUR WHICH IS BY IBLEAM

AND HE FLED TO MEGIDDO AND DIED THERE

HIS SERVANTS CARRIED HIM IN A CHARIOT TO JERUSALEM AND BURIED HIM IN HIS TOMB WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID

IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF JORAM THE SON OF AHAB AHAZIAH BEGAN TO REIGN OVER JUDAH

WHEN JEHU CAME TO JEZREEL JEZEBEL HEARD OF IT

AND SHE PAINTED HER EYES AND ADORNED HER HEAD AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW

AND AS JEHU ENTERED THE GATE SHE SAID IS IT PEACE YOU ZIMRI MURDERER OF YOUR MASTER

 AND HE LIFTED UP HIS FACE TO THE WINDOW AND SAID WHO IS ON MY SIDE

WHO

 TWO OR THREE EUNUCHS LOOKED OUT AT HIM

HE SAID THROW HER DOWN

 SO THEY THREW HER DOWN

AND SOME OF HER BLOOD SPATTERED ON THE WALL AND ON THE HORSES AND THEY TRAMPLED ON HER

THEN HE WENT IN AND ATE AND DRANK

AND HE SAID SEE NOW TO THIS CURSED WOMAN AND BURY HER FOR SHE IS A KING'S DAUGHTER

 BUT WHEN THEY WENT TO BURY HER THEY FOUND NO MORE OF HER THAN THE SKULL AND THE FEET AND THE PALMS OF HER HANDS

WHEN THEY CAME BACK AND TOLD HIM HE SAID THIS IS THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE BY HIS SERVANT ELIJAH THE TISHBITE 'IN THE TERRITORY OF JEZREEL THE DOGS SHALL EAT THE FLESH OF JEZEBEL AND THE CORPSE OF JEZEBEL SHALL BE AS DUNG ON THE FACE OF THE FIELD IN THE TERRITORY OF JEZREEL SO THAT NO ONE CAN SAY THIS IS JEZEBEL

'NOW AHAB HAD SEVENTY SONS IN SAMARIA

SO JEHU WROTE LETTERS AND SENT THEM TO SAMARIA TO THE RULERS OF THE CITY TO THE ELDERS AND TO THE GUARDIANS OF THE SONS OF AHAB SAYING NOW THEN AS SOON AS THIS LETTER COMES TO YOU SEEING YOUR MASTER'S SONS ARE WITH YOU AND THERE ARE WITH YOU CHARIOTS AND HORSES FORTIFIED CITIES ALSO AND WEAPONS SELECT THE BEST AND FITTEST OF YOUR MASTER'S SONS AND SET HIM ON HIS FATHER'S THRONE AND FIGHT FOR YOUR MASTER'S HOUSE

 BUT THEY WERE EXCEEDINGLY AFRAID AND SAID BEHOLD THE TWO KINGS COULD NOT STAND BEFORE HIM

HOW THEN CAN WE STAND

 SO HE WHO WAS OVER THE PALACE AND HE WHO WAS OVER THE CITY TOGETHER WITH THE ELDERS AND THE GUARDIANS SENT TO JEHU SAYING WE ARE YOUR SERVANTS AND WE WILL DO ALL THAT YOU TELL US

WE WILL NOT MAKE ANYONE KING

DO WHATEVER IS GOOD IN YOUR EYES

 THEN HE WROTE TO THEM A SECOND LETTER SAYING IF YOU ARE ON MY SIDE AND IF YOU ARE READY TO OBEY ME TAKE THE HEADS OF YOUR MASTER'S SONS AND COME TO ME AT JEZREEL TOMORROW AT THIS TIME

 NOW THE KING'S SONS SEVENTY PERSONS WERE WITH THE GREAT MEN OF THE CITY WHO WERE BRINGING THEM UP

AND AS SOON AS THE LETTER CAME TO THEM THEY TOOK THE KING'S SONS AND SLAUGHTERED THEM SEVENTY PERSONS AND PUT THEIR HEADS IN BASKETS AND SENT THEM TO HIM AT JEZREEL

WHEN THE MESSENGER CAME AND TOLD HIM THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE HEADS OF THE KING'S SONS HE SAID LAY THEM IN TWO HEAPS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE UNTIL THE MORNING

 THEN IN THE MORNING WHEN HE WENT OUT HE STOOD AND SAID TO ALL THE PEOPLE YOU ARE INNOCENT

IT WAS I WHO CONSPIRED AGAINST MY MASTER AND KILLED HIM BUT WHO STRUCK DOWN ALL THESE

KNOW THEN THAT THERE SHALL FALL TO THE EARTH NOTHING OF THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH THE LORD SPOKE CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF AHAB FOR THE LORD HAS DONE WHAT HE SAID BY HIS SERVANT ELIJAH

 SO JEHU STRUCK DOWN ALL WHO REMAINED OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB IN JEZREEL ALL HIS GREAT MEN AND HIS CLOSE FRIENDS AND HIS PRIESTS UNTIL HE LEFT HIM NONE REMAINING

THEN HE SET OUT AND WENT TO SAMARIA

ON THE WAY WHEN HE WAS AT BETHEKED OF THE SHEPHERDS JEHU MET THE RELATIVES OF AHAZIAH KING OF JUDAH AND HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

 AND THEY ANSWERED WE ARE THE RELATIVES OF AHAZIAH AND WE CAME DOWN TO VISIT THE ROYAL PRINCES AND THE SONS OF THE QUEEN MOTHER

 HE SAID TAKE THEM ALIVE

 AND THEY TOOK THEM ALIVE AND SLAUGHTERED THEM AT THE PIT OF BETHEKED FORTYTWO PERSONS AND HE SPARED NONE OF THEM

AND WHEN HE DEPARTED FROM THERE HE MET JEHONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB COMING TO MEET HIM

AND HE GREETED HIM AND SAID TO HIM IS YOUR HEART TRUE TO MY HEART AS MINE IS TO YOURS

 AND JEHONADAB ANSWERED IT IS

 JEHU SAID IF IT IS GIVE ME YOUR HAND

 SO HE GAVE HIM HIS HAND

AND JEHU TOOK HIM UP WITH HIM INTO THE CHARIOT

AND HE SAID COME WITH ME AND SEE MY ZEAL FOR THE LORD

 SO HE HAD HIM RIDE IN HIS CHARIOT

AND WHEN HE CAME TO SAMARIA HE STRUCK DOWN ALL WHO REMAINED TO AHAB IN SAMARIA TILL HE HAD WIPED THEM OUT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE TO ELIJAH

THEN JEHU ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE AND SAID TO THEM AHAB SERVED BAAL A LITTLE BUT JEHU WILL SERVE HIM MUCH

NOW THEREFORE CALL TO ME ALL THE PROPHETS OF BAAL ALL HIS WORSHIPERS AND ALL HIS PRIESTS

LET NONE BE MISSING FOR I HAVE A GREAT SACRIFICE TO OFFER TO BAAL

WHOEVER IS MISSING SHALL NOT LIVE

 BUT JEHU DID IT WITH CUNNING IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE WORSHIPERS OF BAAL

AND JEHU ORDERED SANCTIFY A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY FOR BAAL

 SO THEY PROCLAIMED IT

AND JEHU SENT THROUGHOUT ALL ISRAEL AND ALL THE WORSHIPERS OF BAAL CAME SO THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN LEFT WHO DID NOT COME

AND THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND THE HOUSE OF BAAL WAS FILLED FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER

HE SAID TO HIM WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WARDROBE BRING OUT THE VESTMENTS FOR ALL THE WORSHIPERS OF BAAL

 SO HE BROUGHT OUT THE VESTMENTS FOR THEM

THEN JEHU WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF BAAL WITH JEHONADAB THE SON OF RECHAB AND HE SAID TO THE WORSHIPERS OF BAAL SEARCH AND SEE THAT THERE IS NO SERVANT OF THE LORD HERE AMONG YOU BUT ONLY THE WORSHIPERS OF BAAL

 THEN THEY WENT IN TO OFFER SACRIFICES AND BURNT OFFERINGS

NOW JEHU HAD STATIONED EIGHTY MEN OUTSIDE AND SAID THE MAN WHO ALLOWS ANY OF THOSE WHOM I GIVE INTO YOUR HANDS TO ESCAPE SHALL FORFEIT HIS LIFE

 SO AS SOON AS HE HAD MADE AN END OF OFFERING THE BURNT OFFERING JEHU SAID TO THE GUARD AND TO THE OFFICERS GO IN AND STRIKE THEM DOWN; LET NOT A MAN ESCAPE

 SO WHEN THEY PUT THEM TO THE SWORD THE GUARD AND THE OFFICERS CAST THEM OUT AND WENT INTO THE INNER ROOM OF THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE PILLAR THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND BURNED IT

AND THEY DEMOLISHED THE PILLAR OF BAAL AND DEMOLISHED THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND MADE IT A LATRINE TO THIS DAY

THUS JEHU WIPED OUT BAAL FROM ISRAEL

BUT JEHU DID NOT TURN ASIDE FROM THE SINS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SINTHAT IS THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND IN DAN

AND THE LORD SAID TO JEHU BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE WELL IN CARRYING OUT WHAT IS RIGHT IN MY EYES AND HAVE DONE TO THE HOUSE OF AHAB ACCORDING TO ALL THAT WAS IN MY HEART YOUR SONS OF THE FOURTH GENERATION SHALL SIT ON THE THRONE OF ISRAEL

 BUT JEHU WAS NOT CAREFUL TO WALK IN THE LAW OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WITH ALL HIS HEART

HE DID NOT TURN FROM THE SINS OF JEROBOAM WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN

IN THOSE DAYS THE LORD BEGAN TO CUT OFF PARTS OF ISRAEL

HAZAEL DEFEATED THEM THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY OF ISRAEL FROM THE JORDAN EASTWARD ALL THE LAND OF GILEAD THE GADITES AND THE REUBENITES AND THE MANASSITES FROM AROER WHICH IS BY THE VALLEY OF THE ARNON THAT IS GILEAD AND BASHAN

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHU AND ALL THAT HE DID AND ALL HIS MIGHT ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

SO JEHU SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN SAMARIA

AND JEHOAHAZ HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

THE TIME THAT JEHU REIGNED OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA WAS TWENTYEIGHT YEARS

NOW WHEN ATHALIAH THE MOTHER OF AHAZIAH SAW THAT HER SON WAS DEAD SHE AROSE AND DESTROYED ALL THE ROYAL FAMILY

BUT JEHOSHEBA THE DAUGHTER OF KING JORAM SISTER OF AHAZIAH TOOK JOASH THE SON OF AHAZIAH AND STOLE HIM AWAY FROM AMONG THE KING'S SONS WHO WERE BEING PUT TO DEATH AND SHE PUT HIM AND HIS NURSE IN A BEDROOM

THUS THEY HID HIM FROM ATHALIAH SO THAT HE WAS NOT PUT TO DEATH

AND HE REMAINED WITH HER SIX YEARS HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WHILE ATHALIAH REIGNED OVER THE LAND

BUT IN THE SEVENTH YEAR JEHOIADA SENT AND BROUGHT THE CAPTAINS OF THE CARITES AND OF THE GUARDS AND HAD THEM COME TO HIM IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM AND PUT THEM UNDER OATH IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND HE SHOWED THEM THE KING'S SON

AND HE COMMANDED THEM THIS IS THE THING THAT YOU SHALL DO ONE THIRD OF YOU THOSE WHO COME OFF DUTY ON THE SABBATH AND GUARD THE KING'S HOUSE ANOTHER THIRD BEING AT THE GATE SUR AND A THIRD AT THE GATE BEHIND THE GUARDS SHALL GUARD THE PALACE

AND THE TWO DIVISIONS OF YOU WHICH COME ON DUTY IN FORCE ON THE SABBATH AND GUARD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ON BEHALF OF THE KING SHALL SURROUND THE KING EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS IN HIS HAND

AND WHOEVER APPROACHES THE RANKS IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH

BE WITH THE KING WHEN HE GOES OUT AND WHEN HE COMES IN

 THE CAPTAINS DID ACCORDING TO ALL THAT JEHOIADA THE PRIEST COMMANDED AND THEY EACH BROUGHT HIS MEN WHO WERE TO GO OFF DUTY ON THE SABBATH WITH THOSE WHO WERE TO COME ON DUTY ON THE SABBATH AND CAME TO JEHOIADA THE PRIEST

AND THE PRIEST GAVE TO THE CAPTAINS THE SPEARS AND SHIELDS THAT HAD BEEN KING DAVID'S WHICH WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE GUARDS STOOD EVERY MAN WITH HIS WEAPONS IN HIS HAND FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE AROUND THE ALTAR AND THE HOUSE ON BEHALF OF THE KING

THEN HE BROUGHT OUT THE KING'S SON AND PUT THE CROWN ON HIM AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY

AND THEY PROCLAIMED HIM KING AND ANOINTED HIM AND THEY CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND SAID LONG LIVE THE KING

 WHEN ATHALIAH HEARD THE NOISE OF THE GUARD AND OF THE PEOPLE SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD TO THE PEOPLE

AND WHEN SHE LOOKED THERE WAS THE KING STANDING BY THE PILLAR ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM AND THE CAPTAINS AND THE TRUMPETERS BESIDE THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICING AND BLOWING TRUMPETS

AND ATHALIAH TORE HER CLOTHES AND CRIED TREASON

TREASON

 THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST COMMANDED THE CAPTAINS WHO WERE SET OVER THE ARMY BRING HER OUT BETWEEN THE RANKS AND PUT TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS HER

 FOR THE PRIEST SAID LET HER NOT BE PUT TO DEATH IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER; AND SHE WENT THROUGH THE HORSES' ENTRANCE TO THE KING'S HOUSE AND THERE SHE WAS PUT TO DEATH

AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN THE LORD AND THE KING AND PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE LORD'S PEOPLE AND ALSO BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PEOPLE

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WENT TO THE HOUSE OF BAAL AND TORE IT DOWN; HIS ALTARS AND HIS IMAGES THEY BROKE IN PIECES AND THEY KILLED MATTAN THE PRIEST OF BAAL BEFORE THE ALTARS

AND THE PRIEST POSTED WATCHMEN OVER THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE TOOK THE CAPTAINS THE CARITES THE GUARDS AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND THEY BROUGHT THE KING DOWN FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD MARCHING THROUGH THE GATE OF THE GUARDS TO THE KING'S HOUSE

AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE THRONE OF THE KINGS

SO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND THE CITY WAS QUIET AFTER ATHALIAH HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH WITH THE SWORD AT THE KING'S HOUSE

JEHOASH WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN

IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF JEHU JEHOASH BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FORTY YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ZIBIAH OF BEERSHEBA

AND JEHOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS BECAUSE JEHOIADA THE PRIEST INSTRUCTED HIM

NEVERTHELESS THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY; THE PEOPLE CONTINUED TO SACRIFICE AND MAKE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES

JEHOASH SAID TO THE PRIESTS ALL THE MONEY OF THE HOLY THINGS THAT IS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE MONEY FOR WHICH EACH MAN IS ASSESSEDTHE MONEY FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF PERSONSAND THE MONEY THAT A MAN'S HEART PROMPTS HIM TO BRING INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD LET THE PRIESTS TAKE EACH FROM HIS DONOR AND LET THEM REPAIR THE HOUSE WHEREVER ANY NEED OF REPAIRS IS DISCOVERED

 BUT BY THE TWENTYTHIRD YEAR OF KING JEHOASH THE PRIESTS HAD MADE NO REPAIRS ON THE HOUSE

THEREFORE KING JEHOASH SUMMONED JEHOIADA THE PRIEST AND THE OTHER PRIESTS AND SAID TO THEM WHY ARE YOU NOT REPAIRING THE HOUSE

NOW THEREFORE TAKE NO MORE MONEY FROM YOUR DONORS BUT HAND IT OVER FOR THE REPAIR OF THE HOUSE

 SO THE PRIESTS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE NO MORE MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT REPAIR THE HOUSE

THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST TOOK A CHEST AND BORED A HOLE IN THE LID OF IT AND SET IT BESIDE THE ALTAR ON THE RIGHT SIDE AS ONE ENTERED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE PRIESTS WHO GUARDED THE THRESHOLD PUT IN IT ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND WHENEVER THEY SAW THAT THERE WAS MUCH MONEY IN THE CHEST THE KING'S SECRETARY AND THE HIGH PRIEST CAME UP AND THEY BAGGED AND COUNTED THE MONEY THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

THEN THEY WOULD GIVE THE MONEY THAT WAS WEIGHED OUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKMEN WHO HAD THE OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THEY PAID IT OUT TO THE CARPENTERS AND THE BUILDERS WHO WORKED ON THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND TO THE MASONS AND THE STONECUTTERS AS WELL AS TO BUY TIMBER AND QUARRIED STONE FOR MAKING REPAIRS ON THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND FOR ANY OUTLAY FOR THE REPAIRS OF THE HOUSE

BUT THERE WERE NOT MADE FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BASINS OF SILVER SNUFFERS BOWLS TRUMPETS OR ANY VESSELS OF GOLD OR OF SILVER FROM THE MONEY THAT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOR THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE WORKMEN WHO WERE REPAIRING THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WITH IT

AND THEY DID NOT ASK AN ACCOUNTING FROM THE MEN INTO WHOSE HAND THEY DELIVERED THE MONEY TO PAY OUT TO THE WORKMEN FOR THEY DEALT HONESTLY

THE MONEY FROM THE GUILT OFFERINGS AND THE MONEY FROM THE SIN OFFERINGS WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD; IT BELONGED TO THE PRIESTS

AT THAT TIME HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA WENT UP AND FOUGHT AGAINST GATH AND TOOK IT

BUT WHEN HAZAEL SET HIS FACE TO GO UP AGAINST JERUSALEM JEHOASH KING OF JUDAH TOOK ALL THE SACRED GIFTS THAT JEHOSHAPHAT AND JEHORAM AND AHAZIAH HIS FATHERS THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAD DEDICATED AND HIS OWN SACRED GIFTS AND ALL THE GOLD THAT WAS FOUND IN THE TREASURIES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND SENT THESE TO HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA

THEN HAZAEL WENT AWAY FROM JERUSALEM

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOASH AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

HIS SERVANTS AROSE AND MADE A CONSPIRACY AND STRUCK DOWN JOASH IN THE HOUSE OF MILLO ON THE WAY THAT GOES DOWN TO SILLA

IT WAS JOZACAR THE SON OF SHIMEATH AND JEHOZABAD THE SON OF SHOMER HIS SERVANTS WHO STRUCK HIM DOWN SO THAT HE DIED

AND THEY BURIED HIM WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND AMAZIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE TWENTYTHIRD YEAR OF JOASH THE SON OF AHAZIAH KING OF JUDAH JEHOAHAZ THE SON OF JEHU BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA AND HE REIGNED SEVENTEEN YEARS

HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AND FOLLOWED THE SINS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN; HE DID NOT DEPART FROM THEM

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE GAVE THEM CONTINUALLY INTO THE HAND OF HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA AND INTO THE HAND OF BENHADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL

THEN JEHOAHAZ SOUGHT THE FAVOR OF THE LORD AND THE LORD LISTENED TO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL HOW THE KING OF SYRIA OPPRESSED THEM

THEREFORE THE LORD GAVE ISRAEL A SAVIOR SO THAT THEY ESCAPED FROM THE HAND OF THE SYRIANS AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL LIVED IN THEIR HOMES AS FORMERLY

NEVERTHELESS THEY DID NOT DEPART FROM THE SINS OF THE HOUSE OF JEROBOAM WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN BUT WALKED IN THEM; AND THE ASHERAH ALSO REMAINED IN SAMARIA

 FOR THERE WAS NOT LEFT TO JEHOAHAZ AN ARMY OF MORE THAN FIFTY HORSEMEN AND TEN CHARIOTS AND TEN THOUSAND FOOTMEN FOR THE KING OF SYRIA HAD DESTROYED THEM AND MADE THEM LIKE THE DUST AT THRESHING

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOAHAZ AND ALL THAT HE DID AND HIS MIGHT ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

SO JEHOAHAZ SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND THEY BURIED HIM IN SAMARIA AND JOASH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE THIRTYSEVENTH YEAR OF JOASH KING OF JUDAH JEHOASH THE SON OF JEHOAHAZ BEGAN TO REIGN OVER ISRAEL IN SAMARIA AND HE REIGNED SIXTEEN YEARS

HE ALSO DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

HE DID NOT DEPART FROM ALL THE SINS OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHICH HE MADE ISRAEL TO SIN BUT HE WALKED IN THEM

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOASH AND ALL THAT HE DID AND THE MIGHT WITH WHICH HE FOUGHT AGAINST AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

SO JOASH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND JEROBOAM SAT ON HIS THRONE

AND JOASH WAS BURIED IN SAMARIA WITH THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

NOW WHEN ELISHA HAD FALLEN SICK WITH THE ILLNESS OF WHICH HE WAS TO DIE JOASH KING OF ISRAEL WENT DOWN TO HIM AND WEPT BEFORE HIM CRYING MY FATHER MY FATHER

THE CHARIOTS OF ISRAEL AND ITS HORSEMEN

 AND ELISHA SAID TO HIM TAKE A BOW AND ARROWS

 SO HE TOOK A BOW AND ARROWS

THEN HE SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL DRAW THE BOW AND HE DREW IT

AND ELISHA LAID HIS HANDS ON THE KING'S HANDS

AND HE SAID OPEN THE WINDOW EASTWARD AND HE OPENED IT

THEN ELISHA SAID SHOOT AND HE SHOT

AND HE SAID THE LORD'S ARROW OF VICTORY THE ARROW OF VICTORY OVER SYRIA

FOR YOU SHALL FIGHT THE SYRIANS IN APHEK UNTIL YOU HAVE MADE AN END OF THEM

 AND HE SAID TAKE THE ARROWS AND HE TOOK THEM

AND HE SAID TO THE KING OF ISRAEL STRIKE THE GROUND WITH THEM

 AND HE STRUCK THREE TIMES AND STOPPED

THEN THE MAN OF GOD WAS ANGRY WITH HIM AND SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE STRUCK FIVE OR SIX TIMES; THEN YOU WOULD HAVE STRUCK DOWN SYRIA UNTIL YOU HAD MADE AN END OF IT BUT NOW YOU WILL STRIKE DOWN SYRIA ONLY THREE TIMES

 SO ELISHA DIED AND THEY BURIED HIM

NOW BANDS OF MOABITES USED TO INVADE THE LAND IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR

AND AS A MAN WAS BEING BURIED BEHOLD A MARAUDING BAND WAS SEEN AND THE MAN WAS THROWN INTO THE GRAVE OF ELISHA AND AS SOON AS THE MAN TOUCHED THE BONES OF ELISHA HE REVIVED AND STOOD ON HIS FEET

NOW HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA OPPRESSED ISRAEL ALL THE DAYS OF JEHOAHAZ

BUT THE LORD WAS GRACIOUS TO THEM AND HAD COMPASSION ON THEM AND HE TURNED TOWARD THEM BECAUSE OF HIS COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB AND WOULD NOT DESTROY THEM NOR HAS HE CAST THEM FROM HIS PRESENCE UNTIL NOW

WHEN HAZAEL KING OF SYRIA DIED BENHADAD HIS SON BECAME KING IN HIS PLACE

THEN JEHOASH THE SON OF JEHOAHAZ TOOK AGAIN FROM BENHADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL THE CITIES THAT HE HAD TAKEN FROM JEHOAHAZ HIS FATHER IN WAR

THREE TIMES JOASH DEFEATED HIM AND RECOVERED THE CITIES OF ISRAEL

IN THE SECOND YEAR OF JOASH THE SON OF JOAHAZ KING OF ISRAEL AMAZIAH THE SON OF JOASH KING OF JUDAH BEGAN TO REIGN

HE WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWENTYNINE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS JEHOADDIN OF JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD YET NOT LIKE DAVID HIS FATHER

HE DID IN ALL THINGS AS JOASH HIS FATHER HAD DONE

BUT THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT REMOVED; THE PEOPLE STILL SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES

AND AS SOON AS THE ROYAL POWER WAS FIRMLY IN HIS HAND HE STRUCK DOWN HIS SERVANTS WHO HAD STRUCK DOWN THE KING HIS FATHER

BUT HE DID NOT PUT TO DEATH THE CHILDREN OF THE MURDERERS ACCORDING TO WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF MOSES WHERE THE LORD COMMANDED FATHERS SHALL NOT BE PUT TO DEATH BECAUSE OF THEIR CHILDREN NOR SHALL CHILDREN BE PUT TO DEATH BECAUSE OF THEIR FATHERS

BUT EACH ONE SHALL DIE FOR HIS OWN SIN

 HE STRUCK DOWN TEN THOUSAND EDOMITES IN THE VALLEY OF SALT AND TOOK SELA BY STORM AND CALLED IT JOKTHEEL WHICH IS ITS NAME TO THIS DAY

THEN AMAZIAH SENT MESSENGERS TO JEHOASH THE SON OF JEHOAHAZ SON OF JEHU KING OF ISRAEL SAYING COME LET US LOOK ONE ANOTHER IN THE FACE

 AND JEHOASH KING OF ISRAEL SENT WORD TO AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH A THISTLE ON LEBANON SENT TO A CEDAR ON LEBANON SAYING 'GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY SON FOR A WIFE' AND A WILD BEAST OF LEBANON PASSED BY AND TRAMPLED DOWN THE THISTLE

YOU HAVE INDEED STRUCK DOWN EDOM AND YOUR HEART HAS LIFTED YOU UP

BE CONTENT WITH YOUR GLORY AND STAY AT HOME FOR WHY SHOULD YOU PROVOKE TROUBLE SO THAT YOU FALL YOU AND JUDAH WITH YOU

 BUT AMAZIAH WOULD NOT LISTEN

SO JEHOASH KING OF ISRAEL WENT UP AND HE AND AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH FACED ONE ANOTHER IN BATTLE AT BETHSHEMESH WHICH BELONGS TO JUDAH

AND JUDAH WAS DEFEATED BY ISRAEL AND EVERY MAN FLED TO HIS HOME

AND JEHOASH KING OF ISRAEL CAPTURED AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH THE SON OF JEHOASH SON OF AHAZIAH AT BETHSHEMESH AND CAME TO JERUSALEM AND BROKE DOWN THE WALL OF JERUSALEM FOR FOUR HUNDRED CUBITS FROM THE EPHRAIM GATE TO THE CORNER GATE

AND HE SEIZED ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER AND ALL THE VESSELS THAT WERE FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND IN THE TREASURIES OF THE KING'S HOUSE ALSO HOSTAGES AND HE RETURNED TO SAMARIA

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOASH THAT HE DID AND HIS MIGHT AND HOW HE FOUGHT WITH AMAZIAH KING OF JUDAH ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND JEHOASH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN SAMARIA WITH THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND JEROBOAM HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

NOW THE REST OF THE DEEDS OF AMAZIAH ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND THEY MADE A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM IN JERUSALEM AND HE FLED TO LACHISH

BUT THEY SENT AFTER HIM TO LACHISH AND PUT HIM TO DEATH THERE

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM ON HORSES; AND HE WAS BURIED IN JERUSALEM WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID

AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH TOOK AZARIAH WHO WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND MADE HIM KING INSTEAD OF HIS FATHER AMAZIAH

HE BUILT ELATH AND RESTORED IT TO JUDAH AFTER THE KING SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS

IN THE FIFTEENTH YEAR OF AMAZIAH THE SON OF JOASH KING OF JUDAH JEROBOAM THE SON OF JOASH KING OF ISRAEL BEGAN TO REIGN IN SAMARIA AND HE REIGNED FORTYONE YEARS

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

HE RESTORED THE BORDER OF ISRAEL FROM LEBOHAMATH AS FAR AS THE SEA OF THE ARABAH ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHICH HE SPOKE BY HIS SERVANT JONAH THE SON OF AMITTAI THE PROPHET WHO WAS FROM GATHHEPHER

FOR THE LORD SAW THAT THE AFFLICTION OF ISRAEL WAS VERY BITTER FOR THERE WAS NONE LEFT BOND OR FREE AND THERE WAS NONE TO HELP ISRAEL

BUT THE LORD HAD NOT SAID THAT HE WOULD BLOT OUT THE NAME OF ISRAEL FROM UNDER HEAVEN SO HE SAVED THEM BY THE HAND OF JEROBOAM THE SON OF JOASH

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEROBOAM AND ALL THAT HE DID AND HIS MIGHT HOW HE FOUGHT AND HOW HE RESTORED DAMASCUS AND HAMATH TO JUDAH IN ISRAEL ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

AND JEROBOAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND ZECHARIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

THE PEOPLE STILL SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES

HE BUILT THE UPPER GATE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOTHAM AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

IN THOSE DAYS THE LORD BEGAN TO SEND REZIN THE KING OF SYRIA AND PEKAH THE SON OF REMALIAH AGAINST JUDAH

JOTHAM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND AHAZ HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR OF PEKAH THE SON OF REMALIAH AHAZ THE SON OF JOTHAM KING OF JUDAH BEGAN TO REIGN

AHAZ WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED SIXTEEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

AND HE DID NOT DO WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD HIS GOD AS HIS FATHER DAVID HAD DONE BUT HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL

HE EVEN BURNED HIS SON AS AN OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE DESPICABLE PRACTICES OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND HE SACRIFICED AND MADE OFFERINGS ON THE HIGH PLACES AND ON THE HILLS AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE

THEN REZIN KING OF SYRIA AND PEKAH THE SON OF REMALIAH KING OF ISRAEL CAME UP TO WAGE WAR ON JERUSALEM AND THEY BESIEGED AHAZ BUT COULD NOT CONQUER HIM

AT THAT TIME REZIN THE KING OF SYRIA RECOVERED ELATH FOR SYRIA AND DROVE THE MEN OF JUDAH FROM ELATH AND THE EDOMITES CAME TO ELATH WHERE THEY DWELL TO THIS DAY

SO AHAZ SENT MESSENGERS TO TIGLATHPILESER KING OF ASSYRIA SAYING I AM YOUR SERVANT AND YOUR SON

COME UP AND RESCUE ME FROM THE HAND OF THE KING OF SYRIA AND FROM THE HAND OF THE KING OF ISRAEL WHO ARE ATTACKING ME

 AHAZ ALSO TOOK THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND IN THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND SENT A PRESENT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA

AND THE KING OF ASSYRIA LISTENED TO HIM

THE KING OF ASSYRIA MARCHED UP AGAINST DAMASCUS AND TOOK IT CARRYING ITS PEOPLE CAPTIVE TO KIR AND HE KILLED REZIN

WHEN KING AHAZ WENT TO DAMASCUS TO MEET TIGLATHPILESER KING OF ASSYRIA HE SAW THE ALTAR THAT WAS AT DAMASCUS

AND KING AHAZ SENT TO URIAH THE PRIEST A MODEL OF THE ALTAR AND ITS PATTERN EXACT IN ALL ITS DETAILS

AND URIAH THE PRIEST BUILT THE ALTAR; IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THAT KING AHAZ HAD SENT FROM DAMASCUS SO URIAH THE PRIEST MADE IT BEFORE KING AHAZ ARRIVED FROM DAMASCUS

AND WHEN THE KING CAME FROM DAMASCUS THE KING VIEWED THE ALTAR

THEN THE KING DREW NEAR TO THE ALTAR AND WENT UP ON IT AND BURNED HIS BURNT OFFERING AND HIS GRAIN OFFERING AND POURED HIS DRINK OFFERING AND THREW THE BLOOD OF HIS PEACE OFFERINGS ON THE ALTAR

AND THE BRONZE ALTAR THAT WAS BEFORE THE LORD HE REMOVED FROM THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE FROM THE PLACE BETWEEN HIS ALTAR AND THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND PUT IT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF HIS ALTAR

AND KING AHAZ COMMANDED URIAH THE PRIEST SAYING ON THE GREAT ALTAR BURN THE MORNING BURNT OFFERING AND THE EVENING GRAIN OFFERING AND THE KING'S BURNT OFFERING AND HIS GRAIN OFFERING WITH THE BURNT OFFERING OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND THEIR GRAIN OFFERING AND THEIR DRINK OFFERING

AND THROW ON IT ALL THE BLOOD OF THE BURNT OFFERING AND ALL THE BLOOD OF THE SACRIFICE BUT THE BRONZE ALTAR SHALL BE FOR ME TO INQUIRE BY

 URIAH THE PRIEST DID ALL THIS AS KING AHAZ COMMANDED

AND KING AHAZ CUT OFF THE FRAMES OF THE STANDS AND REMOVED THE BASIN FROM THEM AND HE TOOK DOWN THE SEA FROM OFF THE BRONZE OXEN THAT WERE UNDER IT AND PUT IT ON A STONE PEDESTAL

AND THE COVERED WAY FOR THE SABBATH THAT HAD BEEN BUILT INSIDE THE HOUSE AND THE OUTER ENTRANCE FOR THE KING HE CAUSED TO GO AROUND THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BECAUSE OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF AHAZ THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND AHAZ SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS FATHERS IN THE CITY OF DAVID AND HEZEKIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THE TWELFTH YEAR OF AHAZ KING OF JUDAH HOSHEA THE SON OF ELAH BEGAN TO REIGN IN SAMARIA OVER ISRAEL AND HE REIGNED NINE YEARS

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD YET NOT AS THE KINGS OF ISRAEL WHO WERE BEFORE HIM

AGAINST HIM CAME UP SHALMANESER KING OF ASSYRIA

AND HOSHEA BECAME HIS VASSAL AND PAID HIM TRIBUTE

BUT THE KING OF ASSYRIA FOUND TREACHERY IN HOSHEA FOR HE HAD SENT MESSENGERS TO SO KING OF EGYPT AND OFFERED NO TRIBUTE TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA AS HE HAD DONE YEAR BY YEAR

THEREFORE THE KING OF ASSYRIA SHUT HIM UP AND BOUND HIM IN PRISON

THEN THE KING OF ASSYRIA INVADED ALL THE LAND AND CAME TO SAMARIA AND FOR THREE YEARS HE BESIEGED IT

IN THE NINTH YEAR OF HOSHEA THE KING OF ASSYRIA CAPTURED SAMARIA AND HE CARRIED THE ISRAELITES AWAY TO ASSYRIA AND PLACED THEM IN HALAH AND ON THE HABOR THE RIVER OF GOZAN AND IN THE CITIES OF THE MEDES

AND THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD SINNED AGAINST THE LORD THEIR GOD WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT FROM UNDER THE HAND OF PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT AND HAD FEARED OTHER GODS AND WALKED IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND IN THE CUSTOMS THAT THE KINGS OF ISRAEL HAD PRACTICED

AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DID SECRETLY AGAINST THE LORD THEIR GOD THINGS THAT WERE NOT RIGHT

THEY BUILT FOR THEMSELVES HIGH PLACES IN ALL THEIR TOWNS FROM WATCHTOWER TO FORTIFIED CITY

THEY SET UP FOR THEMSELVES PILLARS AND ASHERIM ON EVERY HIGH HILL AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE AND THERE THEY MADE OFFERINGS ON ALL THE HIGH PLACES AS THE NATIONS DID WHOM THE LORD CARRIED AWAY BEFORE THEM

AND THEY DID WICKED THINGS PROVOKING THE LORD TO ANGER AND THEY SERVED IDOLS OF WHICH THE LORD HAD SAID TO THEM YOU SHALL NOT DO THIS

 YET THE LORD WARNED ISRAEL AND JUDAH BY EVERY PROPHET AND EVERY SEER SAYING TURN FROM YOUR EVIL WAYS AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND MY STATUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL THE LAW THAT I COMMANDED YOUR FATHERS AND THAT I SENT TO YOU BY MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

 BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN BUT WERE STUBBORN AS THEIR FATHERS HAD BEEN WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE LORD THEIR GOD

THEY DESPISED HIS STATUTES AND HIS COVENANT THAT HE MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS AND THE WARNINGS THAT HE GAVE THEM

THEY WENT AFTER FALSE IDOLS AND BECAME FALSE AND THEY FOLLOWED THE NATIONS THAT WERE AROUND THEM CONCERNING WHOM THE LORD HAD COMMANDED THEM THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DO LIKE THEM

AND THEY ABANDONED ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD THEIR GOD AND MADE FOR THEMSELVES METAL IMAGES OF TWO CALVES; AND THEY MADE AN ASHERAH AND WORSHIPED ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND SERVED BAAL

AND THEY BURNED THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS AS OFFERINGS AND USED DIVINATION AND OMENS AND SOLD THEMSELVES TO DO EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD PROVOKING HIM TO ANGER

THEREFORE THE LORD WAS VERY ANGRY WITH ISRAEL AND REMOVED THEM OUT OF HIS SIGHT

NONE WAS LEFT BUT THE TRIBE OF JUDAH ONLY

JUDAH ALSO DID NOT KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD THEIR GOD BUT WALKED IN THE CUSTOMS THAT ISRAEL HAD INTRODUCED

AND THE LORD REJECTED ALL THE DESCENDANTS OF ISRAEL AND AFFLICTED THEM AND GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF PLUNDERERS UNTIL HE HAD CAST THEM OUT OF HIS SIGHT

WHEN HE HAD TORN ISRAEL FROM THE HOUSE OF DAVID THEY MADE JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT KING

AND JEROBOAM DROVE ISRAEL FROM FOLLOWING THE LORD AND MADE THEM COMMIT GREAT SIN

THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WALKED IN ALL THE SINS THAT JEROBOAM DID

THEY DID NOT DEPART FROM THEM UNTIL THE LORD REMOVED ISRAEL OUT OF HIS SIGHT AS HE HAD SPOKEN BY ALL HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

SO ISRAEL WAS EXILED FROM THEIR OWN LAND TO ASSYRIA UNTIL THIS DAY

AND THE KING OF ASSYRIA BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM BABYLON CUTHAH AVVA HAMATH AND SEPHARVAIM AND PLACED THEM IN THE CITIES OF SAMARIA INSTEAD OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF SAMARIA AND LIVED IN ITS CITIES

AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DWELLING THERE THEY DID NOT FEAR THE LORD

THEREFORE THE LORD SENT LIONS AMONG THEM WHICH KILLED SOME OF THEM

SO THE KING OF ASSYRIA WAS TOLD THE NATIONS THAT YOU HAVE CARRIED AWAY AND PLACED IN THE CITIES OF SAMARIA DO NOT KNOW THE LAW OF THE GOD OF THE LAND

THEREFORE HE HAS SENT LIONS AMONG THEM AND BEHOLD THEY ARE KILLING THEM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW THE LAW OF THE GOD OF THE LAND

 THEN THE KING OF ASSYRIA COMMANDED SEND THERE ONE OF THE PRIESTS WHOM YOU CARRIED AWAY FROM THERE AND LET HIM GO AND DWELL THERE AND TEACH THEM THE LAW OF THE GOD OF THE LAND

 SO ONE OF THE PRIESTS WHOM THEY HAD CARRIED AWAY FROM SAMARIA CAME AND LIVED IN BETHEL AND TAUGHT THEM HOW THEY SHOULD FEAR THE LORD

BUT EVERY NATION STILL MADE GODS OF ITS OWN AND PUT THEM IN THE SHRINES OF THE HIGH PLACES THAT THE SAMARITANS HAD MADE EVERY NATION IN THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVED

THE MEN OF BABYLON MADE SUCCOTHBENOTH THE MEN OF CUTH MADE NERGAL THE MEN OF HAMATH MADE ASHIMA AND THE AVVITES MADE NIBHAZ AND TARTAK; AND THE SEPHARVITES BURNED THEIR CHILDREN IN THE FIRE TO ADRAMMELECH AND ANAMMELECH THE GODS OF SEPHARVAIM

THEY ALSO FEARED THE LORD AND APPOINTED FROM AMONG THEMSELVES ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE AS PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES WHO SACRIFICED FOR THEM IN THE SHRINES OF THE HIGH PLACES

SO THEY FEARED THE LORD BUT ALSO SERVED THEIR OWN GODS AFTER THE MANNER OF THE NATIONS FROM AMONG WHOM THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY

TO THIS DAY THEY DO ACCORDING TO THE FORMER MANNER

THEY DO NOT FEAR THE LORD AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THE STATUTES OR THE RULES OR THE LAW OR THE COMMANDMENT THAT THE LORD COMMANDED THE CHILDREN OF JACOB WHOM HE NAMED ISRAEL

THE LORD MADE A COVENANT WITH THEM AND COMMANDED THEM YOU SHALL NOT FEAR OTHER GODS OR BOW YOURSELVES TO THEM OR SERVE THEM OR SACRIFICE TO THEM BUT YOU SHALL FEAR THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT WITH GREAT POWER AND WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM

YOU SHALL BOW YOURSELVES TO HIM AND TO HIM YOU SHALL SACRIFICE

AND THE STATUTES AND THE RULES AND THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT THAT HE WROTE FOR YOU YOU SHALL ALWAYS BE CAREFUL TO DO

YOU SHALL NOT FEAR OTHER GODS AND YOU SHALL NOT FORGET THE COVENANT THAT I HAVE MADE WITH YOU

YOU SHALL NOT FEAR OTHER GODS BUT YOU SHALL FEAR THE LORD YOUR GOD AND HE WILL DELIVER YOU OUT OF THE HAND OF ALL YOUR ENEMIES

 HOWEVER THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN BUT THEY DID ACCORDING TO THEIR FORMER MANNER

SO THESE NATIONS FEARED THE LORD AND ALSO SERVED THEIR CARVED IMAGES

THEIR CHILDREN DID LIKEWISE AND THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDRENAS THEIR FATHERS DID SO THEY DO TO THIS DAY

IN THE THIRD YEAR OF HOSHEA SON OF ELAH KING OF ISRAEL HEZEKIAH THE SON OF AHAZ KING OF JUDAH BEGAN TO REIGN

HE WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWENTYNINE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ABI THE DAUGHTER OF ZECHARIAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT DAVID HIS FATHER HAD DONE

HE REMOVED THE HIGH PLACES AND BROKE THE PILLARS AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERAH

AND HE BROKE IN PIECES THE BRONZE SERPENT THAT MOSES HAD MADE FOR UNTIL THOSE DAYS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD MADE OFFERINGS TO IT IT WAS CALLED NEHUSHTAN

HE TRUSTED IN THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL SO THAT THERE WAS NONE LIKE HIM AMONG ALL THE KINGS OF JUDAH AFTER HIM NOR AMONG THOSE WHO WERE BEFORE HIM

FOR HE HELD FAST TO THE LORD

HE DID NOT DEPART FROM FOLLOWING HIM BUT KEPT THE COMMANDMENTS THAT THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES

AND THE LORD WAS WITH HIM; WHEREVER HE WENT OUT HE PROSPERED

HE REBELLED AGAINST THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND WOULD NOT SERVE HIM

HE STRUCK DOWN THE PHILISTINES AS FAR AS GAZA AND ITS TERRITORY FROM WATCHTOWER TO FORTIFIED CITY

IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF KING HEZEKIAH WHICH WAS THE SEVENTH YEAR OF HOSHEA SON OF ELAH KING OF ISRAEL SHALMANESER KING OF ASSYRIA CAME UP AGAINST SAMARIA AND BESIEGED IT AND AT THE END OF THREE YEARS HE TOOK IT

IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF HEZEKIAH WHICH WAS THE NINTH YEAR OF HOSHEA KING OF ISRAEL SAMARIA WAS TAKEN

THE KING OF ASSYRIA CARRIED THE ISRAELITES AWAY TO ASSYRIA AND PUT THEM IN HALAH AND ON THE HABOR THE RIVER OF GOZAN AND IN THE CITIES OF THE MEDES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE OF THE LORD THEIR GOD BUT TRANSGRESSED HIS COVENANT EVEN ALL THAT MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD COMMANDED

THEY NEITHER LISTENED NOR OBEYED

IN THE FOURTEENTH YEAR OF KING HEZEKIAH SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA CAME UP AGAINST ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES OF JUDAH AND TOOK THEM

AND HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH SENT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA AT LACHISH SAYING I HAVE DONE WRONG; WITHDRAW FROM ME

WHATEVER YOU IMPOSE ON ME I WILL BEAR

 AND THE KING OF ASSYRIA REQUIRED OF HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH THREE HUNDRED TALENTS OF SILVER AND THIRTY TALENTS OF GOLD

AND HEZEKIAH GAVE HIM ALL THE SILVER THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND IN THE TREASURIES OF THE KING'S HOUSE

AT THAT TIME HEZEKIAH STRIPPED THE GOLD FROM THE DOORS OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD AND FROM THE DOORPOSTS THAT HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH HAD OVERLAID AND GAVE IT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA

AND THE KING OF ASSYRIA SENT THE TARTAN THE RABSARIS AND THE RABSHAKEH WITH A GREAT ARMY FROM LACHISH TO KING HEZEKIAH AT JERUSALEM

AND THEY WENT UP AND CAME TO JERUSALEM

WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY CAME AND STOOD BY THE CONDUIT OF THE UPPER POOL WHICH IS ON THE HIGHWAY TO THE WASHER'S FIELD

AND WHEN THEY CALLED FOR THE KING THERE CAME OUT TO THEM ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNAH THE SECRETARY AND JOAH THE SON OF ASAPH THE RECORDER

AND THE RABSHAKEH SAID TO THEM SAY TO HEZEKIAH 'THUS SAYS THE GREAT KING THE KING OF ASSYRIA ON WHAT DO YOU REST THIS TRUST OF YOURS

DO YOU THINK THAT MERE WORDS ARE STRATEGY AND POWER FOR WAR

IN WHOM DO YOU NOW TRUST THAT YOU HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME

BEHOLD YOU ARE TRUSTING NOW IN EGYPT THAT BROKEN REED OF A STAFF WHICH WILL PIERCE THE HAND OF ANY MAN WHO LEANS ON IT

SUCH IS PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT TO ALL WHO TRUST IN HIM

BUT IF YOU SAY TO ME WE TRUST IN THE LORD OUR GOD IS IT NOT HE WHOSE HIGH PLACES AND ALTARS HEZEKIAH HAS REMOVED SAYING TO JUDAH AND TO JERUSALEM YOU SHALL WORSHIP BEFORE THIS ALTAR IN JERUSALEM

COME NOW MAKE A WAGER WITH MY MASTER THE KING OF ASSYRIA I WILL GIVE YOU TWO THOUSAND HORSES IF YOU ARE ABLE ON YOUR PART TO SET RIDERS ON THEM

HOW THEN CAN YOU REPULSE A SINGLE CAPTAIN AMONG THE LEAST OF MY MASTER'S SERVANTS WHEN YOU TRUST IN EGYPT FOR CHARIOTS AND FOR HORSEMEN

MOREOVER IS IT WITHOUT THE LORD THAT I HAVE COME UP AGAINST THIS PLACE TO DESTROY IT

THE LORD SAID TO ME GO UP AGAINST THIS LAND AND DESTROY IT

' THEN ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH AND SHEBNAH AND JOAH SAID TO THE RABSHAKEH PLEASE SPEAK TO YOUR SERVANTS IN ARAMAIC FOR WE UNDERSTAND IT

DO NOT SPEAK TO US IN THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH WITHIN THE HEARING OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE WALL

 BUT THE RABSHAKEH SAID TO THEM HAS MY MASTER SENT ME TO SPEAK THESE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER AND TO YOU AND NOT TO THE MEN SITTING ON THE WALL WHO ARE DOOMED WITH YOU TO EAT THEIR OWN DUNG AND TO DRINK THEIR OWN URINE

 THEN THE RABSHAKEH STOOD AND CALLED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE IN THE LANGUAGE OF JUDAH HEAR THE WORD OF THE GREAT KING THE KING OF ASSYRIA

THUS SAYS THE KING 'DO NOT LET HEZEKIAH DECEIVE YOU FOR HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HAND

DO NOT LET HEZEKIAH MAKE YOU TRUST IN THE LORD BY SAYING THE LORD WILL SURELY DELIVER US AND THIS CITY WILL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

' DO NOT LISTEN TO HEZEKIAH FOR THUS SAYS THE KING OF ASSYRIA 'MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH ME AND COME OUT TO ME

THEN EACH ONE OF YOU WILL EAT OF HIS OWN VINE AND EACH ONE OF HIS OWN FIG TREE AND EACH ONE OF YOU WILL DRINK THE WATER OF HIS OWN CISTERN UNTIL I COME AND TAKE YOU AWAY TO A LAND LIKE YOUR OWN LAND A LAND OF GRAIN AND WINE A LAND OF BREAD AND VINEYARDS A LAND OF OLIVE TREES AND HONEY THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE

AND DO NOT LISTEN TO HEZEKIAH WHEN HE MISLEADS YOU BY SAYING THE LORD WILL DELIVER US

HAS ANY OF THE GODS OF THE NATIONS EVER DELIVERED HIS LAND OUT OF THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

WHERE ARE THE GODS OF HAMATH AND ARPAD

WHERE ARE THE GODS OF SEPHARVAIM HENA AND IVVAH

HAVE THEY DELIVERED SAMARIA OUT OF MY HAND

WHO AMONG ALL THE GODS OF THE LANDS HAVE DELIVERED THEIR LANDS OUT OF MY HAND THAT THE LORD SHOULD DELIVER JERUSALEM OUT OF MY HAND

' BUT THE PEOPLE WERE SILENT AND ANSWERED HIM NOT A WORD FOR THE KING'S COMMAND WAS DO NOT ANSWER HIM

 THEN ELIAKIM THE SON OF HILKIAH WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNA THE SECRETARY AND JOAH THE SON OF ASAPH THE RECORDER CAME TO HEZEKIAH WITH THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND TOLD HIM THE WORDS OF THE RABSHAKEH

AS SOON AS KING HEZEKIAH HEARD IT HE TORE HIS CLOTHES AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH SACKCLOTH AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE SENT ELIAKIM WHO WAS OVER THE HOUSEHOLD AND SHEBNA THE SECRETARY AND THE SENIOR PRIESTS COVERED WITH SACKCLOTH TO THE PROPHET ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ

THEY SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS HEZEKIAH THIS DAY IS A DAY OF DISTRESS OF REBUKE AND OF DISGRACE; CHILDREN HAVE COME TO THE POINT OF BIRTH AND THERE IS NO STRENGTH TO BRING THEM FORTH

IT MAY BE THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HEARD ALL THE WORDS OF THE RABSHAKEH WHOM HIS MASTER THE KING OF ASSYRIA HAS SENT TO MOCK THE LIVING GOD AND WILL REBUKE THE WORDS THAT THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS HEARD; THEREFORE LIFT UP YOUR PRAYER FOR THE REMNANT THAT IS LEFT

 WHEN THE SERVANTS OF KING HEZEKIAH CAME TO ISAIAH ISAIAH SAID TO THEM SAY TO YOUR MASTER 'THUS SAYS THE LORD DO NOT BE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD WITH WHICH THE SERVANTS OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA HAVE REVILED ME

BEHOLD I WILL PUT A SPIRIT IN HIM SO THAT HE SHALL HEAR A RUMOR AND RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND AND I WILL MAKE HIM FALL BY THE SWORD IN HIS OWN LAND

' THE RABSHAKEH RETURNED AND FOUND THE KING OF ASSYRIA FIGHTING AGAINST LIBNAH FOR HE HEARD THAT THE KING HAD LEFT LACHISH

NOW THE KING HEARD CONCERNING TIRHAKAH KING OF CUSH BEHOLD HE HAS SET OUT TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU

 SO HE SENT MESSENGERS AGAIN TO HEZEKIAH SAYING THUS SHALL YOU SPEAK TO HEZEKIAH KING OF JUDAH 'DO NOT LET YOUR GOD IN WHOM YOU TRUST DECEIVE YOU BY PROMISING THAT JERUSALEM WILL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

BEHOLD YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA HAVE DONE TO ALL LANDS DEVOTING THEM TO DESTRUCTION

AND SHALL YOU BE DELIVERED

HAVE THE GODS OF THE NATIONS DELIVERED THEM THE NATIONS THAT MY FATHERS DESTROYED GOZAN HARAN REZEPH AND THE PEOPLE OF EDEN WHO WERE IN TELASSAR

WHERE IS THE KING OF HAMATH THE KING OF ARPAD THE KING OF THE CITY OF SEPHARVAIM THE KING OF HENA OR THE KING OF IVVAH

' HEZEKIAH RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM THE HAND OF THE MESSENGERS AND READ IT; AND HEZEKIAH WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SPREAD IT BEFORE THE LORD

AND HEZEKIAH PRAYED BEFORE THE LORD AND SAID O LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL WHO IS ENTHRONED ABOVE THE CHERUBIM YOU ARE THE GOD YOU ALONE OF ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH; YOU HAVE MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH

INCLINE YOUR EAR O LORD AND HEAR; OPEN YOUR EYES O LORD AND SEE; AND HEAR THE WORDS OF SENNACHERIB WHICH HE HAS SENT TO MOCK THE LIVING GOD

TRULY O LORD THE KINGS OF ASSYRIA HAVE LAID WASTE THE NATIONS AND THEIR LANDS AND HAVE CAST THEIR GODS INTO THE FIRE FOR THEY WERE NOT GODS BUT THE WORK OF MEN'S HANDS WOOD AND STONE

THEREFORE THEY WERE DESTROYED

SO NOW O LORD OUR GOD SAVE US PLEASE FROM HIS HAND THAT ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW THAT YOU O LORD ARE GOD ALONE

 THEN ISAIAH THE SON OF AMOZ SENT TO HEZEKIAH SAYING THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL YOUR PRAYER TO ME ABOUT SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA I HAVE HEARD

THIS IS THE WORD THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN CONCERNING HIM SHE DESPISES YOU SHE SCORNS YOUTHE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF ZION; SHE WAGS HER HEAD BEHIND YOUTHE DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM

WHOM HAVE YOU MOCKED AND REVILED

AGAINST WHOM HAVE YOU RAISED YOUR VOICE AND LIFTED YOUR EYES TO THE HEIGHTS

AGAINST THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL

BY YOUR MESSENGERS YOU HAVE MOCKED THE LORD AND YOU HAVE SAID 'WITH MY MANY CHARIOTS I HAVE GONE UP THE HEIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE FAR RECESSES OF LEBANON; I FELLED ITS TALLEST CEDARS ITS CHOICEST CYPRESSES; I ENTERED ITS FARTHEST LODGING PLACE ITS MOST FRUITFUL FOREST

I DUG WELLS AND DRANK FOREIGN WATERS AND I DRIED UP WITH THE SOLE OF MY FOOT ALL THE STREAMS OF EGYPT

' HAVE YOU NOT HEARD THAT I DETERMINED IT LONG AGO

I PLANNED FROM DAYS OF OLD WHAT NOW I BRING TO PASS THAT YOU SHOULD TURN FORTIFIED CITIES INTO HEAPS OF RUINS WHILE THEIR INHABITANTS SHORN OF STRENGTH ARE DISMAYED AND CONFOUNDED AND HAVE BECOME LIKE PLANTS OF THE FIELD AND LIKE TENDER GRASS LIKE GRASS ON THE HOUSETOPS BLIGHTED BEFORE IT IS GROWN

BUT I KNOW YOUR SITTING DOWN AND YOUR GOING OUT AND COMING IN AND YOUR RAGING AGAINST ME

BECAUSE YOU HAVE RAGED AGAINST ME AND YOUR COMPLACENCY HAS COME INTO MY EARS I WILL PUT MY HOOK IN YOUR NOSE AND MY BIT IN YOUR MOUTH AND I WILL TURN YOU BACK ON THE WAY BY WHICH YOU CAME

AND THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN FOR YOU THIS YEAR EAT WHAT GROWS OF ITSELF AND IN THE SECOND YEAR WHAT SPRINGS OF THE SAME

THEN IN THE THIRD YEAR SOW AND REAP AND PLANT VINEYARDS AND EAT THEIR FRUIT

AND THE SURVIVING REMNANT OF THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL AGAIN TAKE ROOT DOWNWARD AND BEAR FRUIT UPWARD

FOR OUT OF JERUSALEM SHALL GO A REMNANT AND OUT OF MOUNT ZION A BAND OF SURVIVORS

THE ZEAL OF THE LORD WILL DO THIS

THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD CONCERNING THE KING OF ASSYRIA HE SHALL NOT COME INTO THIS CITY OR SHOOT AN ARROW THERE OR COME BEFORE IT WITH A SHIELD OR CAST UP A SIEGE MOUND AGAINST IT

BY THE WAY THAT HE CAME BY THE SAME HE SHALL RETURN AND HE SHALL NOT COME INTO THIS CITY DECLARES THE LORD

FOR I WILL DEFEND THIS CITY TO SAVE IT FOR MY OWN SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF MY SERVANT DAVID

 AND THAT NIGHT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND STRUCK DOWN  IN THE CAMP OF THE ASSYRIANS

AND WHEN PEOPLE AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING BEHOLD THESE WERE ALL DEAD BODIES

THEN SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA DEPARTED AND WENT HOME AND LIVED AT NINEVEH

AND AS HE WAS WORSHIPING IN THE HOUSE OF NISROCH HIS GOD ADRAMMELECH AND SHAREZER HIS SONS STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH THE SWORD AND ESCAPED INTO THE LAND OF ARARAT

AND ESARHADDON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

IN THOSE DAYS HEZEKIAH BECAME SICK AND WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH

AND ISAIAH THE PROPHET THE SON OF AMOZ CAME TO HIM AND SAID TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD 'SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER FOR YOU SHALL DIE; YOU SHALL NOT RECOVER

' THEN HEZEKIAH TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND PRAYED TO THE LORD SAYING NOW O LORD PLEASE REMEMBER HOW I HAVE WALKED BEFORE YOU IN FAITHFULNESS AND WITH A WHOLE HEART AND HAVE DONE WHAT IS GOOD IN YOUR SIGHT

 AND HEZEKIAH WEPT BITTERLY

AND BEFORE ISAIAH HAD GONE OUT OF THE MIDDLE COURT THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO HIM TURN BACK AND SAY TO HEZEKIAH THE LEADER OF MY PEOPLE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF DAVID YOUR FATHER I HAVE HEARD YOUR PRAYER; I HAVE SEEN YOUR TEARS

BEHOLD I WILL HEAL YOU

ON THE THIRD DAY YOU SHALL GO UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND I WILL ADD FIFTEEN YEARS TO YOUR LIFE

I WILL DELIVER YOU AND THIS CITY OUT OF THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND I WILL DEFEND THIS CITY FOR MY OWN SAKE AND FOR MY SERVANT DAVID'S SAKE

 AND ISAIAH SAID BRING A CAKE OF FIGS

AND LET THEM TAKE AND LAY IT ON THE BOIL THAT HE MAY RECOVER

 AND HEZEKIAH SAID TO ISAIAH WHAT SHALL BE THE SIGN THAT THE LORD WILL HEAL ME AND THAT I SHALL GO UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ON THE THIRD DAY

 AND ISAIAH SAID THIS SHALL BE THE SIGN TO YOU FROM THE LORD THAT THE LORD WILL DO THE THING THAT HE HAS PROMISED SHALL THE SHADOW GO FORWARD TEN STEPS OR GO BACK TEN STEPS

 AND HEZEKIAH ANSWERED IT IS AN EASY THING FOR THE SHADOW TO LENGTHEN TEN STEPS

RATHER LET THE SHADOW GO BACK TEN STEPS

 AND ISAIAH THE PROPHET CALLED TO THE LORD AND HE BROUGHT THE SHADOW BACK TEN STEPS BY WHICH IT HAD GONE DOWN ON THE STEPS OF AHAZ

AT THAT TIME MERODACHBALADAN THE SON OF BALADAN KING OF BABYLON SENT ENVOYS WITH LETTERS AND A PRESENT TO HEZEKIAH FOR HE HEARD THAT HEZEKIAH HAD BEEN SICK

AND HEZEKIAH WELCOMED THEM AND HE SHOWED THEM ALL HIS TREASURE HOUSE THE SILVER THE GOLD THE SPICES THE PRECIOUS OIL HIS ARMORY ALL THAT WAS FOUND IN HIS STOREHOUSES

THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS HOUSE OR IN ALL HIS REALM THAT HEZEKIAH DID NOT SHOW THEM

THEN ISAIAH THE PROPHET CAME TO KING HEZEKIAH AND SAID TO HIM WHAT DID THESE MEN SAY

AND FROM WHERE DID THEY COME TO YOU

 AND HEZEKIAH SAID THEY HAVE COME FROM A FAR COUNTRY FROM BABYLON

 HE SAID WHAT HAVE THEY SEEN IN YOUR HOUSE

 AND HEZEKIAH ANSWERED THEY HAVE SEEN ALL THAT IS IN MY HOUSE; THERE IS NOTHING IN MY STOREHOUSES THAT I DID NOT SHOW THEM

 THEN ISAIAH SAID TO HEZEKIAH HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE COMING WHEN ALL THAT IS IN YOUR HOUSE AND THAT WHICH YOUR FATHERS HAVE STORED UP TILL THIS DAY SHALL BE CARRIED TO BABYLON

NOTHING SHALL BE LEFT SAYS THE LORD

AND SOME OF YOUR OWN SONS WHO SHALL BE BORN TO YOU SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY AND THEY SHALL BE EUNUCHS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF BABYLON

 THEN SAID HEZEKIAH TO ISAIAH THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN IS GOOD

 FOR HE THOUGHT WHY NOT IF THERE WILL BE PEACE AND SECURITY IN MY DAYS

 THE REST OF THE DEEDS OF HEZEKIAH AND ALL HIS MIGHT AND HOW HE MADE THE POOL AND THE CONDUIT AND BROUGHT WATER INTO THE CITY ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND HEZEKIAH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND MANASSEH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

MANASSEH WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED FIFTYFIVE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS HEPHZIBAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO THE DESPICABLE PRACTICES OF THE NATIONS WHOM THE LORD DROVE OUT BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

FOR HE REBUILT THE HIGH PLACES THAT HEZEKIAH HIS FATHER HAD DESTROYED AND HE ERECTED ALTARS FOR BAAL AND MADE AN ASHERAH AS AHAB KING OF ISRAEL HAD DONE AND WORSHIPED ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND SERVED THEM

AND HE BUILT ALTARS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OF WHICH THE LORD HAD SAID IN JERUSALEM WILL I PUT MY NAME

 AND HE BUILT ALTARS FOR ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN IN THE TWO COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND HE BURNED HIS SON AS AN OFFERING AND USED FORTUNETELLING AND OMENS AND DEALT WITH MEDIUMS AND WITH WIZARDS

HE DID MUCH EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD PROVOKING HIM TO ANGER

AND THE CARVED IMAGE OF ASHERAH THAT HE HAD MADE HE SET IN THE HOUSE OF WHICH THE LORD SAID TO DAVID AND TO SOLOMON HIS SON IN THIS HOUSE AND IN JERUSALEM WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL I WILL PUT MY NAME FOREVER

AND I WILL NOT CAUSE THE FEET OF ISRAEL TO WANDER ANYMORE OUT OF THE LAND THAT I GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS IF ONLY THEY WILL BE CAREFUL TO DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED THEM AND ACCORDING TO ALL THE LAW THAT MY SERVANT MOSES COMMANDED THEM

 BUT THEY DID NOT LISTEN AND MANASSEH LED THEM ASTRAY TO DO MORE EVIL THAN THE NATIONS HAD DONE WHOM THE LORD DESTROYED BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

AND THE LORD SAID BY HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS BECAUSE MANASSEH KING OF JUDAH HAS COMMITTED THESE ABOMINATIONS AND HAS DONE THINGS MORE EVIL THAN ALL THAT THE AMORITES DID WHO WERE BEFORE HIM AND HAS MADE JUDAH ALSO TO SIN WITH HIS IDOLS THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL BEHOLD I AM BRINGING UPON JERUSALEM AND JUDAH SUCH DISASTER THAT THE EARS OF EVERYONE WHO HEARS OF IT WILL TINGLE

AND I WILL STRETCH OVER JERUSALEM THE MEASURING LINE OF SAMARIA AND THE PLUMB LINE OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND I WILL WIPE JERUSALEM AS ONE WIPES A DISH WIPING IT AND TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN

AND I WILL FORSAKE THE REMNANT OF MY HERITAGE AND GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THEIR ENEMIES AND THEY SHALL BECOME A PREY AND A SPOIL TO ALL THEIR ENEMIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE WHAT IS EVIL IN MY SIGHT AND HAVE PROVOKED ME TO ANGER SINCE THE DAY THEIR FATHERS CAME OUT OF EGYPT EVEN TO THIS DAY

 MOREOVER MANASSEH SHED VERY MUCH INNOCENT BLOOD TILL HE HAD FILLED JERUSALEM FROM ONE END TO ANOTHER BESIDES THE SIN THAT HE MADE JUDAH TO SIN SO THAT THEY DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF MANASSEH AND ALL THAT HE DID AND THE SIN THAT HE COMMITTED ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND MANASSEH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND WAS BURIED IN THE GARDEN OF HIS HOUSE IN THE GARDEN OF UZZA AND AMON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AMON WAS TWENTYTWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED TWO YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS MESHULLEMETH THE DAUGHTER OF HARUZ OF JOTBAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD AS MANASSEH HIS FATHER HAD DONE

HE WALKED IN ALL THE WAY IN WHICH HIS FATHER WALKED AND SERVED THE IDOLS THAT HIS FATHER SERVED AND WORSHIPED THEM

HE ABANDONED THE LORD THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS AND DID NOT WALK IN THE WAY OF THE LORD

AND THE SERVANTS OF AMON CONSPIRED AGAINST HIM AND PUT THE KING TO DEATH IN HIS HOUSE

BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND STRUCK DOWN ALL THOSE WHO HAD CONSPIRED AGAINST KING AMON AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND MADE JOSIAH HIS SON KING IN HIS PLACE

NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF AMON THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

AND HE WAS BURIED IN HIS TOMB IN THE GARDEN OF UZZA AND JOSIAH HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

JOSIAH WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED THIRTYONE YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS JEDIDAH THE DAUGHTER OF ADAIAH OF BOZKATH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND WALKED IN ALL THE WAY OF DAVID HIS FATHER AND HE DID NOT TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT

IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF KING JOSIAH THE KING SENT SHAPHAN THE SON OF AZALIAH SON OF MESHULLAM THE SECRETARY TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SAYING GO UP TO HILKIAH THE HIGH PRIEST THAT HE MAY COUNT THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WHICH THE KEEPERS OF THE THRESHOLD HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE PEOPLE

AND LET IT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE WORKMEN WHO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LET THEM GIVE IT TO THE WORKMEN WHO ARE AT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD REPAIRING THE HOUSE THAT IS TO THE CARPENTERS AND TO THE BUILDERS AND TO THE MASONS AND LET THEM USE IT FOR BUYING TIMBER AND QUARRIED STONE TO REPAIR THE HOUSE

BUT NO ACCOUNTING SHALL BE ASKED FROM THEM FOR THE MONEY THAT IS DELIVERED INTO THEIR HAND FOR THEY DEAL HONESTLY

 AND HILKIAH THE HIGH PRIEST SAID TO SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY I HAVE FOUND THE BOOK OF THE LAW IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 AND HILKIAH GAVE THE BOOK TO SHAPHAN AND HE READ IT

AND SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY CAME TO THE KING AND REPORTED TO THE KING YOUR SERVANTS HAVE EMPTIED OUT THE MONEY THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE DELIVERED IT INTO THE HAND OF THE WORKMEN WHO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

 THEN SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY TOLD THE KING HILKIAH THE PRIEST HAS GIVEN ME A BOOK

 AND SHAPHAN READ IT BEFORE THE KING

WHEN THE KING HEARD THE WORDS OF THE BOOK OF THE LAW HE TORE HIS CLOTHES

AND THE KING COMMANDED HILKIAH THE PRIEST AND AHIKAM THE SON OF SHAPHAN AND ACHBOR THE SON OF MICAIAH AND SHAPHAN THE SECRETARY AND ASAIAH THE KING'S SERVANT SAYING GO INQUIRE OF THE LORD FOR ME AND FOR THE PEOPLE AND FOR ALL JUDAH CONCERNING THE WORDS OF THIS BOOK THAT HAS BEEN FOUND

FOR GREAT IS THE WRATH OF THE LORD THAT IS KINDLED AGAINST US BECAUSE OUR FATHERS HAVE NOT OBEYED THE WORDS OF THIS BOOK TO DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT IS WRITTEN CONCERNING US

 SO HILKIAH THE PRIEST AND AHIKAM AND ACHBOR AND SHAPHAN AND ASAIAH WENT TO HULDAH THE PROPHETESS THE WIFE OF SHALLUM THE SON OF TIKVAH SON OF HARHAS KEEPER OF THE WARDROBE NOW SHE LIVED IN JERUSALEM IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THEY TALKED WITH HER

AND SHE SAID TO THEM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL 'TELL THE MAN WHO SENT YOU TO ME THUS SAYS THE LORD BEHOLD I WILL BRING DISASTER UPON THIS PLACE AND UPON ITS INHABITANTS ALL THE WORDS OF THE BOOK THAT THE KING OF JUDAH HAS READ

BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND HAVE MADE OFFERINGS TO OTHER GODS THAT THEY MIGHT PROVOKE ME TO ANGER WITH ALL THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS THEREFORE MY WRATH WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST THIS PLACE AND IT WILL NOT BE QUENCHED

BUT TO THE KING OF JUDAH WHO SENT YOU TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO HIM THUS SAYS THE LORD THE GOD OF ISRAEL REGARDING THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD BECAUSE YOUR HEART WAS PENITENT AND YOU HUMBLED YOURSELF BEFORE THE LORD WHEN YOU HEARD HOW I SPOKE AGAINST THIS PLACE AND AGAINST ITS INHABITANTS THAT THEY SHOULD BECOME A DESOLATION AND A CURSE AND YOU HAVE TORN YOUR CLOTHES AND WEPT BEFORE ME I ALSO HAVE HEARD YOU DECLARES THE LORD

THEREFORE BEHOLD I WILL GATHER YOU TO YOUR FATHERS AND YOU SHALL BE GATHERED TO YOUR GRAVE IN PEACE AND YOUR EYES SHALL NOT SEE ALL THE DISASTER THAT I WILL BRING UPON THIS PLACE

' AND THEY BROUGHT BACK WORD TO THE KING

THEN THE KING SENT AND ALL THE ELDERS OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM WERE GATHERED TO HIM

AND THE KING WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND WITH HIM ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM AND THE PRIESTS AND THE PROPHETS ALL THE PEOPLE BOTH SMALL AND GREAT

AND HE READ IN THEIR HEARING ALL THE WORDS OF THE BOOK OF THE COVENANT THAT HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

AND THE KING STOOD BY THE PILLAR AND MADE A COVENANT BEFORE THE LORD TO WALK AFTER THE LORD AND TO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND HIS TESTIMONIES AND HIS STATUTES WITH ALL HIS HEART AND ALL HIS SOUL TO PERFORM THE WORDS OF THIS COVENANT THAT WERE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK

AND ALL THE PEOPLE JOINED IN THE COVENANT

AND THE KING COMMANDED HILKIAH THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE PRIESTS OF THE SECOND ORDER AND THE KEEPERS OF THE THRESHOLD TO BRING OUT OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD ALL THE VESSELS MADE FOR BAAL FOR ASHERAH AND FOR ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN

HE BURNED THEM OUTSIDE JERUSALEM IN THE FIELDS OF THE KIDRON AND CARRIED THEIR ASHES TO BETHEL

AND HE DEPOSED THE PRIESTS WHOM THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAD ORDAINED TO MAKE OFFERINGS IN THE HIGH PLACES AT THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND AROUND JERUSALEM; THOSE ALSO WHO BURNED INCENSE TO BAAL TO THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE CONSTELLATIONS AND ALL THE HOST OF THE HEAVENS

AND HE BROUGHT OUT THE ASHERAH FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OUTSIDE JERUSALEM TO THE BROOK KIDRON AND BURNED IT AT THE BROOK KIDRON AND BEAT IT TO DUST AND CAST THE DUST OF IT UPON THE GRAVES OF THE COMMON PEOPLE

AND HE BROKE DOWN THE HOUSES OF THE MALE CULT PROSTITUTES WHO WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WHERE THE WOMEN WOVE HANGINGS FOR THE ASHERAH

AND HE BROUGHT ALL THE PRIESTS OUT OF THE CITIES OF JUDAH AND DEFILED THE HIGH PLACES WHERE THE PRIESTS HAD MADE OFFERINGS FROM GEBA TO BEERSHEBA

AND HE BROKE DOWN THE HIGH PLACES OF THE GATES THAT WERE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GATE OF JOSHUA THE GOVERNOR OF THE CITY WHICH WERE ON ONE'S LEFT AT THE GATE OF THE CITY

HOWEVER THE PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES DID NOT COME UP TO THE ALTAR OF THE LORD IN JERUSALEM BUT THEY ATE UNLEAVENED BREAD AMONG THEIR BROTHERS

AND HE DEFILED TOPHETH WHICH IS IN THE VALLEY OF THE SON OF HINNOM THAT NO ONE MIGHT BURN HIS SON OR HIS DAUGHTER AS AN OFFERING TO MOLECH

AND HE REMOVED THE HORSES THAT THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAD DEDICATED TO THE SUN AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BY THE CHAMBER OF NATHANMELECH THE CHAMBERLAIN WHICH WAS IN THE PRECINCTS

AND HE BURNED THE CHARIOTS OF THE SUN WITH FIRE

AND THE ALTARS ON THE ROOF OF THE UPPER CHAMBER OF AHAZ WHICH THE KINGS OF JUDAH HAD MADE AND THE ALTARS THAT MANASSEH HAD MADE IN THE TWO COURTS OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD HE PULLED DOWN AND BROKE IN PIECES AND CAST THE DUST OF THEM INTO THE BROOK KIDRON

AND THE KING DEFILED THE HIGH PLACES THAT WERE EAST OF JERUSALEM TO THE SOUTH OF THE MOUNT OF CORRUPTION WHICH SOLOMON THE KING OF ISRAEL HAD BUILT FOR ASHTORETH THE ABOMINATION OF THE SIDONIANS AND FOR CHEMOSH THE ABOMINATION OF MOAB AND FOR MILCOM THE ABOMINATION OF THE AMMONITES

AND HE BROKE IN PIECES THE PILLARS AND CUT DOWN THE ASHERIM AND FILLED THEIR PLACES WITH THE BONES OF MEN

MOREOVER THE ALTAR AT BETHEL THE HIGH PLACE ERECTED BY JEROBOAM THE SON OF NEBAT WHO MADE ISRAEL TO SIN THAT ALTAR WITH THE HIGH PLACE HE PULLED DOWN AND BURNED REDUCING IT TO DUST

HE ALSO BURNED THE ASHERAH

AND AS JOSIAH TURNED HE SAW THE TOMBS THERE ON THE MOUNT

AND HE SENT AND TOOK THE BONES OUT OF THE TOMBS AND BURNED THEM ON THE ALTAR AND DEFILED IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT THE MAN OF GOD PROCLAIMED WHO HAD PREDICTED THESE THINGS

THEN HE SAID WHAT IS THAT MONUMENT THAT I SEE

 AND THE MEN OF THE CITY TOLD HIM IT IS THE TOMB OF THE MAN OF GOD WHO CAME FROM JUDAH AND PREDICTED THESE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE AGAINST THE ALTAR AT BETHEL

 AND HE SAID LET HIM BE; LET NO MAN MOVE HIS BONES

 SO THEY LET HIS BONES ALONE WITH THE BONES OF THE PROPHET WHO CAME OUT OF SAMARIA

AND JOSIAH REMOVED ALL THE SHRINES ALSO OF THE HIGH PLACES THAT WERE IN THE CITIES OF SAMARIA WHICH KINGS OF ISRAEL HAD MADE PROVOKING THE LORD TO ANGER

HE DID TO THEM ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HE HAD DONE AT BETHEL

AND HE SACRIFICED ALL THE PRIESTS OF THE HIGH PLACES WHO WERE THERE ON THE ALTARS AND BURNED HUMAN BONES ON THEM

THEN HE RETURNED TO JERUSALEM

AND THE KING COMMANDED ALL THE PEOPLE KEEP THE PASSOVER TO THE LORD YOUR GOD AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK OF THE COVENANT

 FOR NO SUCH PASSOVER HAD BEEN KEPT SINCE THE DAYS OF THE JUDGES WHO JUDGED ISRAEL OR DURING ALL THE DAYS OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL OR OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

BUT IN THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR OF KING JOSIAH THIS PASSOVER WAS KEPT TO THE LORD IN JERUSALEM

MOREOVER JOSIAH PUT AWAY THE MEDIUMS AND THE NECROMANCERS AND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS AND THE IDOLS AND ALL THE ABOMINATIONS THAT WERE SEEN IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND IN JERUSALEM THAT HE MIGHT ESTABLISH THE WORDS OF THE LAW THAT WERE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK THAT HILKIAH THE PRIEST FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

BEFORE HIM THERE WAS NO KING LIKE HIM WHO TURNED TO THE LORD WITH ALL HIS HEART AND WITH ALL HIS SOUL AND WITH ALL HIS MIGHT ACCORDING TO ALL THE LAW OF MOSES NOR DID ANY LIKE HIM ARISE AFTER HIM

STILL THE LORD DID NOT TURN FROM THE BURNING OF HIS GREAT WRATH BY WHICH HIS ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST JUDAH BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROVOCATIONS WITH WHICH MANASSEH HAD PROVOKED HIM

AND THE LORD SAID I WILL REMOVE JUDAH ALSO OUT OF MY SIGHT AS I HAVE REMOVED ISRAEL AND I WILL CAST OFF THIS CITY THAT I HAVE CHOSEN JERUSALEM AND THE HOUSE OF WHICH I SAID MY NAME SHALL BE THERE

 NOW THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JOSIAH AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

IN HIS DAYS PHARAOH NECO KING OF EGYPT WENT UP TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA TO THE RIVER EUPHRATES

KING JOSIAH WENT TO MEET HIM AND PHARAOH NECO KILLED HIM AT MEGIDDO AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM

AND HIS SERVANTS CARRIED HIM DEAD IN A CHARIOT FROM MEGIDDO AND BROUGHT HIM TO JERUSALEM AND BURIED HIM IN HIS OWN TOMB

AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND TOOK JEHOAHAZ THE SON OF JOSIAH AND ANOINTED HIM AND MADE HIM KING IN HIS FATHER'S PLACE

JEHOAHAZ WAS TWENTYTHREE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED THREE MONTHS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS HAMUTAL THE DAUGHTER OF JEREMIAH OF LIBNAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HIS FATHERS HAD DONE

AND PHARAOH NECO PUT HIM IN BONDS AT RIBLAH IN THE LAND OF HAMATH THAT HE MIGHT NOT REIGN IN JERUSALEM AND LAID ON THE LAND A TRIBUTE OF A HUNDRED TALENTS OF SILVER AND A TALENT OF GOLD

AND PHARAOH NECO MADE ELIAKIM THE SON OF JOSIAH KING IN THE PLACE OF JOSIAH HIS FATHER AND CHANGED HIS NAME TO JEHOIAKIM

BUT HE TOOK JEHOAHAZ AWAY AND HE CAME TO EGYPT AND DIED THERE

AND JEHOIAKIM GAVE THE SILVER AND THE GOLD TO PHARAOH BUT HE TAXED THE LAND TO GIVE THE MONEY ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF PHARAOH

HE EXACTED THE SILVER AND THE GOLD OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND FROM EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS ASSESSMENT TO GIVE IT TO PHARAOH NECO

JEHOIAKIM WAS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO REIGN AND HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS ZEBIDAH THE DAUGHTER OF PEDAIAH OF RUMAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HIS FATHERS HAD DONE

IN HIS DAYS NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME UP AND JEHOIAKIM BECAME HIS SERVANT THREE YEARS

THEN HE TURNED AND REBELLED AGAINST HIM

AND THE LORD SENT AGAINST HIM BANDS OF THE CHALDEANS AND BANDS OF THE SYRIANS AND BANDS OF THE MOABITES AND BANDS OF THE AMMONITES AND SENT THEM AGAINST JUDAH TO DESTROY IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT HE SPOKE BY HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS

SURELY THIS CAME UPON JUDAH AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD TO REMOVE THEM OUT OF HIS SIGHT FOR THE SINS OF MANASSEH ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HE HAD DONE AND ALSO FOR THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HE HAD SHED

FOR HE FILLED JERUSALEM WITH INNOCENT BLOOD AND THE LORD WOULD NOT PARDON

NOW THE REST OF THE DEEDS OF JEHOIAKIM AND ALL THAT HE DID ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH

SO JEHOIAKIM SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS AND JEHOIACHIN HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE

AND THE KING OF EGYPT DID NOT COME AGAIN OUT OF HIS LAND FOR THE KING OF BABYLON HAD TAKEN ALL THAT BELONGED TO THE KING OF EGYPT FROM THE BROOK OF EGYPT TO THE RIVER EUPHRATES

JEHOIACHIN WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING AND HE REIGNED THREE MONTHS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS NEHUSHTA THE DAUGHTER OF ELNATHAN OF JERUSALEM

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT HIS FATHER HAD DONE

AT THAT TIME THE SERVANTS OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME UP TO JERUSALEM AND THE CITY WAS BESIEGED

AND NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME TO THE CITY WHILE HIS SERVANTS WERE BESIEGING IT AND JEHOIACHIN THE KING OF JUDAH GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THE KING OF BABYLON HIMSELF AND HIS MOTHER AND HIS SERVANTS AND HIS OFFICIALS AND HIS PALACE OFFICIALS

THE KING OF BABYLON TOOK HIM PRISONER IN THE EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN AND CARRIED OFF ALL THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND CUT IN PIECES ALL THE VESSELS OF GOLD IN THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD WHICH SOLOMON KING OF ISRAEL HAD MADE AS THE LORD HAD FORETOLD

HE CARRIED AWAY ALL JERUSALEM AND ALL THE OFFICIALS AND ALL THE MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR  CAPTIVES AND ALL THE CRAFTSMEN AND THE SMITHS

NONE REMAINED EXCEPT THE POOREST PEOPLE OF THE LAND

AND HE CARRIED AWAY JEHOIACHIN TO BABYLON

THE KING'S MOTHER THE KING'S WIVES HIS OFFICIALS AND THE CHIEF MEN OF THE LAND HE TOOK INTO CAPTIVITY FROM JERUSALEM TO BABYLON

AND THE KING OF BABYLON BROUGHT CAPTIVE TO BABYLON ALL THE MEN OF VALOR  AND THE CRAFTSMEN AND THE METAL WORKERS  ALL OF THEM STRONG AND FIT FOR WAR

AND THE KING OF BABYLON MADE MATTANIAH JEHOIACHIN'S UNCLE KING IN HIS PLACE AND CHANGED HIS NAME TO ZEDEKIAH

ZEDEKIAH WAS TWENTYONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME KING AND HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS IN JERUSALEM

HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS HAMUTAL THE DAUGHTER OF JEREMIAH OF LIBNAH

AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ACCORDING TO ALL THAT JEHOIAKIM HAD DONE

FOR BECAUSE OF THE ANGER OF THE LORD IT CAME TO THE POINT IN JERUSALEM AND JUDAH THAT HE CAST THEM OUT FROM HIS PRESENCE

AND ZEDEKIAH REBELLED AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON

AND IN THE NINTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON CAME WITH ALL HIS ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM AND LAID SIEGE TO IT

AND THEY BUILT SIEGEWORKS ALL AROUND IT

SO THE CITY WAS BESIEGED TILL THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF KING ZEDEKIAH

ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE FOURTH MONTH THE FAMINE WAS SO SEVERE IN THE CITY THAT THERE WAS NO FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND

THEN A BREACH WAS MADE IN THE CITY AND ALL THE MEN OF WAR FLED BY NIGHT BY THE WAY OF THE GATE BETWEEN THE TWO WALLS BY THE KING'S GARDEN THOUGH THE CHALDEANS WERE AROUND THE CITY

AND THEY WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARABAH

BUT THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS PURSUED THE KING AND OVERTOOK HIM IN THE PLAINS OF JERICHO AND ALL HIS ARMY WAS SCATTERED FROM HIM

THEN THEY CAPTURED THE KING AND BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE KING OF BABYLON AT RIBLAH AND THEY PASSED SENTENCE ON HIM

THEY SLAUGHTERED THE SONS OF ZEDEKIAH BEFORE HIS EYES AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF ZEDEKIAH AND BOUND HIM IN CHAINS AND TOOK HIM TO BABYLON

IN THE FIFTH MONTH ON THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE MONTHTHAT WAS THE NINETEENTH YEAR OF KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLONNEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE BODYGUARD A SERVANT OF THE KING OF BABYLON CAME TO JERUSALEM

AND HE BURNED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE KING'S HOUSE AND ALL THE HOUSES OF JERUSALEM; EVERY GREAT HOUSE HE BURNED DOWN

AND ALL THE ARMY OF THE CHALDEANS WHO WERE WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD BROKE DOWN THE WALLS AROUND JERUSALEM

AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEFT IN THE CITY AND THE DESERTERS WHO HAD DESERTED TO THE KING OF BABYLON TOGETHER WITH THE REST OF THE MULTITUDE NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CARRIED INTO EXILE

BUT THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD LEFT SOME OF THE POOREST OF THE LAND TO BE VINEDRESSERS AND PLOWMEN

AND THE PILLARS OF BRONZE THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE STANDS AND THE BRONZE SEA THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE CHALDEANS BROKE IN PIECES AND CARRIED THE BRONZE TO BABYLON

AND THEY TOOK AWAY THE POTS AND THE SHOVELS AND THE SNUFFERS AND THE DISHES FOR INCENSE AND ALL THE VESSELS OF BRONZE USED IN THE TEMPLE SERVICE THE FIRE PANS ALSO AND THE BOWLS

WHAT WAS OF GOLD THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK AWAY AS GOLD AND WHAT WAS OF SILVER AS SILVER

AS FOR THE TWO PILLARS THE ONE SEA AND THE STANDS THAT SOLOMON HAD MADE FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD THE BRONZE OF ALL THESE VESSELS WAS BEYOND WEIGHT

THE HEIGHT OF THE ONE PILLAR WAS EIGHTEEN CUBITS AND ON IT WAS A CAPITAL OF BRONZE

THE HEIGHT OF THE CAPITAL WAS THREE CUBITS

A LATTICEWORK AND POMEGRANATES ALL OF BRONZE WERE ALL AROUND THE CAPITAL

AND THE SECOND PILLAR HAD THE SAME WITH THE LATTICEWORK

AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK SERAIAH THE CHIEF PRIEST AND ZEPHANIAH THE SECOND PRIEST AND THE THREE KEEPERS OF THE THRESHOLD AND FROM THE CITY HE TOOK AN OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN IN COMMAND OF THE MEN OF WAR AND FIVE MEN OF THE KING'S COUNCIL WHO WERE FOUND IN THE CITY AND THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY WHO MUSTERED THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AND SIXTY MEN OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WHO WERE FOUND IN THE CITY

AND NEBUZARADAN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TOOK THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE KING OF BABYLON AT RIBLAH

AND THE KING OF BABYLON STRUCK THEM DOWN AND PUT THEM TO DEATH AT RIBLAH IN THE LAND OF HAMATH

SO JUDAH WAS TAKEN INTO EXILE OUT OF ITS LAND

AND OVER THE PEOPLE WHO REMAINED IN THE LAND OF JUDAH WHOM NEBUCHADNEZZAR KING OF BABYLON HAD LEFT HE APPOINTED GEDALIAH THE SON OF AHIKAM SON OF SHAPHAN GOVERNOR

NOW WHEN ALL THE CAPTAINS AND THEIR MEN HEARD THAT THE KING OF BABYLON HAD APPOINTED GEDALIAH GOVERNOR THEY CAME WITH THEIR MEN TO GEDALIAH AT MIZPAH NAMELY ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH AND JOHANAN THE SON OF KAREAH AND SERAIAH THE SON OF TANHUMETH THE NETOPHATHITE AND JAAZANIAH THE SON OF THE MAACATHITE

AND GEDALIAH SWORE TO THEM AND THEIR MEN SAYING DO NOT BE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE CHALDEAN OFFICIALS

LIVE IN THE LAND AND SERVE THE KING OF BABYLON AND IT SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU

 BUT IN THE SEVENTH MONTH ISHMAEL THE SON OF NETHANIAH SON OF ELISHAMA OF THE ROYAL FAMILY CAME WITH TEN MEN AND STRUCK DOWN GEDALIAH AND PUT HIM TO DEATH ALONG WITH THE JEWS AND THE CHALDEANS WHO WERE WITH HIM AT MIZPAH

THEN ALL THE PEOPLE BOTH SMALL AND GREAT AND THE CAPTAINS OF THE FORCES AROSE AND WENT TO EGYPT FOR THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE CHALDEANS

AND IN THE THIRTYSEVENTH YEAR OF THE EXILE OF JEHOIACHIN KING OF JUDAH IN THE TWELFTH MONTH ON THE TWENTYSEVENTH DAY OF THE MONTH EVILMERODACH KING OF BABYLON IN THE YEAR THAT HE BEGAN TO REIGN GRACIOUSLY FREED JEHOIACHIN KING OF JUDAH FROM PRISON

AND HE SPOKE KINDLY TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A SEAT ABOVE THE SEATS OF THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM IN BABYLON

SO JEHOIACHIN PUT OFF HIS PRISON GARMENTS

AND EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE DINED REGULARLY AT THE KING'S TABLE AND FOR HIS ALLOWANCE A REGULAR ALLOWANCE WAS GIVEN HIM BY THE KING ACCORDING TO HIS DAILY NEEDS AS LONG AS HE LIVED

ECCLESIASTESTHE WORDS OF THE PREACHER THE SON OF DAVID KING IN JERUSALEM

VANITY OF VANITIES SAYS THE PREACHER VANITY OF VANITIES

ALL IS VANITY

WHAT DOES MAN GAIN BY ALL THE TOIL AT WHICH HE TOILS UNDER THE SUN

A GENERATION GOES AND A GENERATION COMES BUT THE EARTH REMAINS FOREVER

THE SUN RISES AND THE SUN GOES DOWN AND HASTENS TO THE PLACE WHERE IT RISES

THE WIND BLOWS TO THE SOUTH AND GOES AROUND TO THE NORTH; AROUND AND AROUND GOES THE WIND AND ON ITS CIRCUITS THE WIND RETURNS

ALL STREAMS RUN TO THE SEA BUT THE SEA IS NOT FULL; TO THE PLACE WHERE THE STREAMS FLOW THERE THEY FLOW AGAIN

ALL THINGS ARE FULL OF WEARINESS; A MAN CANNOT UTTER IT; THE EYE IS NOT SATISFIED WITH SEEING NOR THE EAR FILLED WITH HEARING

WHAT HAS BEEN IS WHAT WILL BE AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IS WHAT WILL BE DONE AND THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN

IS THERE A THING OF WHICH IT IS SAID SEE THIS IS NEW

IT HAS BEEN ALREADY IN THE AGES BEFORE US

THERE IS NO REMEMBRANCE OF FORMER THINGS NOR WILL THERE BE ANY REMEMBRANCE OF LATER THINGS YET TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO COME AFTER

I THE PREACHER HAVE BEEN KING OVER ISRAEL IN JERUSALEM

AND I APPLIED MY HEART TO SEEK AND TO SEARCH OUT BY WISDOM ALL THAT IS DONE UNDER HEAVEN

IT IS AN UNHAPPY BUSINESS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN TO BE BUSY WITH

I HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN AND BEHOLD ALL IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

WHAT IS CROOKED CANNOT BE MADE STRAIGHT AND WHAT IS LACKING CANNOT BE COUNTED

I SAID IN MY HEART I HAVE ACQUIRED GREAT WISDOM SURPASSING ALL WHO WERE OVER JERUSALEM BEFORE ME AND MY HEART HAS HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE

 AND I APPLIED MY HEART TO KNOW WISDOM AND TO KNOW MADNESS AND FOLLY

I PERCEIVED THAT THIS ALSO IS BUT A STRIVING AFTER WIND

FOR IN MUCH WISDOM IS MUCH VEXATION AND HE WHO INCREASES KNOWLEDGE INCREASES SORROW

I SAID IN MY HEART COME NOW I WILL TEST YOU WITH PLEASURE; ENJOY YOURSELF

 BUT BEHOLD THIS ALSO WAS VANITY

I SAID OF LAUGHTER IT IS MAD AND OF PLEASURE WHAT USE IS IT

 I SEARCHED WITH MY HEART HOW TO CHEER MY BODY WITH WINEMY HEART STILL GUIDING ME WITH WISDOMAND HOW TO LAY HOLD ON FOLLY TILL I MIGHT SEE WHAT WAS GOOD FOR THE CHILDREN OF MAN TO DO UNDER HEAVEN DURING THE FEW DAYS OF THEIR LIFE

I MADE GREAT WORKS

I BUILT HOUSES AND PLANTED VINEYARDS FOR MYSELF

I MADE MYSELF GARDENS AND PARKS AND PLANTED IN THEM ALL KINDS OF FRUIT TREES

I MADE MYSELF POOLS FROM WHICH TO WATER THE FOREST OF GROWING TREES

I BOUGHT MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES AND HAD SLAVES WHO WERE BORN IN MY HOUSE

I HAD ALSO GREAT POSSESSIONS OF HERDS AND FLOCKS MORE THAN ANY WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ME IN JERUSALEM

I ALSO GATHERED FOR MYSELF SILVER AND GOLD AND THE TREASURE OF KINGS AND PROVINCES

I GOT SINGERS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND MANY CONCUBINES THE DELIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN

SO I BECAME GREAT AND SURPASSED ALL WHO WERE BEFORE ME IN JERUSALEM

ALSO MY WISDOM REMAINED WITH ME

AND WHATEVER MY EYES DESIRED I DID NOT KEEP FROM THEM

I KEPT MY HEART FROM NO PLEASURE FOR MY HEART FOUND PLEASURE IN ALL MY TOIL AND THIS WAS MY REWARD FOR ALL MY TOIL

THEN I CONSIDERED ALL THAT MY HANDS HAD DONE AND THE TOIL I HAD EXPENDED IN DOING IT AND BEHOLD ALL WAS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED UNDER THE SUN

SO I TURNED TO CONSIDER WISDOM AND MADNESS AND FOLLY

FOR WHAT CAN THE MAN DO WHO COMES AFTER THE KING

ONLY WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE

THEN I SAW THAT THERE IS MORE GAIN IN WISDOM THAN IN FOLLY AS THERE IS MORE GAIN IN LIGHT THAN IN DARKNESS

THE WISE PERSON HAS HIS EYES IN HIS HEAD BUT THE FOOL WALKS IN DARKNESS

AND YET I PERCEIVED THAT THE SAME EVENT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THEM

THEN I SAID IN MY HEART WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FOOL WILL HAPPEN TO ME ALSO

WHY THEN HAVE I BEEN SO VERY WISE

 AND I SAID IN MY HEART THAT THIS ALSO IS VANITY

FOR OF THE WISE AS OF THE FOOL THERE IS NO ENDURING REMEMBRANCE SEEING THAT IN THE DAYS TO COME ALL WILL HAVE BEEN LONG FORGOTTEN

HOW THE WISE DIES JUST LIKE THE FOOL

SO I HATED LIFE BECAUSE WHAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN WAS GRIEVOUS TO ME FOR ALL IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

I HATED ALL MY TOIL IN WHICH I TOIL UNDER THE SUN SEEING THAT I MUST LEAVE IT TO THE MAN WHO WILL COME AFTER ME AND WHO KNOWS WHETHER HE WILL BE WISE OR A FOOL

YET HE WILL BE MASTER OF ALL FOR WHICH I TOILED AND USED MY WISDOM UNDER THE SUN

THIS ALSO IS VANITY

SO I TURNED ABOUT AND GAVE MY HEART UP TO DESPAIR OVER ALL THE TOIL OF MY LABORS UNDER THE SUN BECAUSE SOMETIMES A PERSON WHO HAS TOILED WITH WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL MUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO BE ENJOYED BY SOMEONE WHO DID NOT TOIL FOR IT

THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND A GREAT EVIL

WHAT HAS A MAN FROM ALL THE TOIL AND STRIVING OF HEART WITH WHICH HE TOILS BENEATH THE SUN

FOR ALL HIS DAYS ARE FULL OF SORROW AND HIS WORK IS A VEXATION

EVEN IN THE NIGHT HIS HEART DOES NOT REST

THIS ALSO IS VANITY

THERE IS NOTHING BETTER FOR A PERSON THAN THAT HE SHOULD EAT AND DRINK AND FIND ENJOYMENT IN HIS TOIL

THIS ALSO I SAW IS FROM THE HAND OF GOD FOR APART FROM HIM WHO CAN EAT OR WHO CAN HAVE ENJOYMENT

FOR TO THE ONE WHO PLEASES HIM GOD HAS GIVEN WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE AND JOY BUT TO THE SINNER HE HAS GIVEN THE BUSINESS OF GATHERING AND COLLECTING ONLY TO GIVE TO ONE WHO PLEASES GOD

THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

FOR EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON AND A TIME FOR EVERY MATTER UNDER HEAVEN A TIME TO BE BORN AND A TIME TO DIE; A TIME TO PLANT AND A TIME TO PLUCK UP WHAT IS PLANTED; A TIME TO KILL AND A TIME TO HEAL; A TIME TO BREAK DOWN AND A TIME TO BUILD UP; A TIME TO WEEP AND A TIME TO LAUGH; A TIME TO MOURN AND A TIME TO DANCE; A TIME TO CAST AWAY STONES AND A TIME TO GATHER STONES TOGETHER; A TIME TO EMBRACE AND A TIME TO REFRAIN FROM EMBRACING; A TIME TO SEEK AND A TIME TO LOSE; A TIME TO KEEP AND A TIME TO CAST AWAY; A TIME TO TEAR AND A TIME TO SEW; A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE AND A TIME TO SPEAK; A TIME TO LOVE AND A TIME TO HATE; A TIME FOR WAR AND A TIME FOR PEACE

WHAT GAIN HAS THE WORKER FROM HIS TOIL

I HAVE SEEN THE BUSINESS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN TO BE BUSY WITH

HE HAS MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME

ALSO HE HAS PUT ETERNITY INTO MAN'S HEART YET SO THAT HE CANNOT FIND OUT WHAT GOD HAS DONE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END

I PERCEIVED THAT THERE IS NOTHING BETTER FOR THEM THAN TO BE JOYFUL AND TO DO GOOD AS LONG AS THEY LIVE; ALSO THAT EVERYONE SHOULD EAT AND DRINK AND TAKE PLEASURE IN ALL HIS TOILTHIS IS GOD'S GIFT TO MAN

I PERCEIVED THAT WHATEVER GOD DOES ENDURES FOREVER; NOTHING CAN BE ADDED TO IT NOR ANYTHING TAKEN FROM IT

GOD HAS DONE IT SO THAT PEOPLE FEAR BEFORE HIM

THAT WHICH IS ALREADY HAS BEEN; THAT WHICH IS TO BE ALREADY HAS BEEN; AND GOD SEEKS WHAT HAS BEEN DRIVEN AWAY

MOREOVER I SAW UNDER THE SUN THAT IN THE PLACE OF JUSTICE EVEN THERE WAS WICKEDNESS AND IN THE PLACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS EVEN THERE WAS WICKEDNESS

I SAID IN MY HEART GOD WILL JUDGE THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED FOR THERE IS A TIME FOR EVERY MATTER AND FOR EVERY WORK

I SAID IN MY HEART WITH REGARD TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN THAT GOD IS TESTING THEM THAT THEY MAY SEE THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE BUT BEASTS

FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CHILDREN OF MAN AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BEASTS IS THE SAME; AS ONE DIES SO DIES THE OTHER

THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME BREATH AND MAN HAS NO ADVANTAGE OVER THE BEASTS FOR ALL IS VANITY

ALL GO TO ONE PLACE

ALL ARE FROM THE DUST AND TO DUST ALL RETURN

WHO KNOWS WHETHER THE SPIRIT OF MAN GOES UPWARD AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BEAST GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH

SO I SAW THAT THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT A MAN SHOULD REJOICE IN HIS WORK FOR THAT IS HIS LOT

WHO CAN BRING HIM TO SEE WHAT WILL BE AFTER HIM

AGAIN I SAW ALL THE OPPRESSIONS THAT ARE DONE UNDER THE SUN

AND BEHOLD THE TEARS OF THE OPPRESSED AND THEY HAD NO ONE TO COMFORT THEM

ON THE SIDE OF THEIR OPPRESSORS THERE WAS POWER AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO COMFORT THEM

AND I THOUGHT THE DEAD WHO ARE ALREADY DEAD MORE FORTUNATE THAN THE LIVING WHO ARE STILL ALIVE

BUT BETTER THAN BOTH IS HE WHO HAS NOT YET BEEN AND HAS NOT SEEN THE EVIL DEEDS THAT ARE DONE UNDER THE SUN

THEN I SAW THAT ALL TOIL AND ALL SKILL IN WORK COME FROM A MAN'S ENVY OF HIS NEIGHBOR

THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

THE FOOL FOLDS HIS HANDS AND EATS HIS OWN FLESH

BETTER IS A HANDFUL OF QUIETNESS THAN TWO HANDS FULL OF TOIL AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

AGAIN I SAW VANITY UNDER THE SUN ONE PERSON WHO HAS NO OTHER EITHER SON OR BROTHER YET THERE IS NO END TO ALL HIS TOIL AND HIS EYES ARE NEVER SATISFIED WITH RICHES SO THAT HE NEVER ASKS FOR WHOM AM I TOILING AND DEPRIVING MYSELF OF PLEASURE

 THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND AN UNHAPPY BUSINESS

TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD REWARD FOR THEIR TOIL

FOR IF THEY FALL ONE WILL LIFT UP HIS FELLOW

BUT WOE TO HIM WHO IS ALONE WHEN HE FALLS AND HAS NOT ANOTHER TO LIFT HIM UP

AGAIN IF TWO LIE TOGETHER THEY KEEP WARM BUT HOW CAN ONE KEEP WARM ALONE

AND THOUGH A MAN MIGHT PREVAIL AGAINST ONE WHO IS ALONE TWO WILL WITHSTAND HIMA THREEFOLD CORD IS NOT QUICKLY BROKEN

BETTER WAS A POOR AND WISE YOUTH THAN AN OLD AND FOOLISH KING WHO NO LONGER KNEW HOW TO TAKE ADVICE

FOR HE WENT FROM PRISON TO THE THRONE THOUGH IN HIS OWN KINGDOM HE HAD BEEN BORN POOR

I SAW ALL THE LIVING WHO MOVE ABOUT UNDER THE SUN ALONG WITH THAT YOUTH WHO WAS TO STAND IN THE KING'S PLACE

THERE WAS NO END OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALL OF WHOM HE LED

YET THOSE WHO COME LATER WILL NOT REJOICE IN HIM

SURELY THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

GUARD YOUR STEPS WHEN YOU GO TO THE HOUSE OF GOD

TO DRAW NEAR TO LISTEN IS BETTER THAN TO OFFER THE SACRIFICE OF FOOLS FOR THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING EVIL

BE NOT RASH WITH YOUR MOUTH NOR LET YOUR HEART BE HASTY TO UTTER A WORD BEFORE GOD FOR GOD IS IN HEAVEN AND YOU ARE ON EARTH

THEREFORE LET YOUR WORDS BE FEW

FOR A DREAM COMES WITH MUCH BUSINESS AND A FOOL'S VOICE WITH MANY WORDS

WHEN YOU VOW A VOW TO GOD DO NOT DELAY PAYING IT FOR HE HAS NO PLEASURE IN FOOLS

PAY WHAT YOU VOW

IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT VOW THAN THAT YOU SHOULD VOW AND NOT PAY

LET NOT YOUR MOUTH LEAD YOU INTO SIN AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE MESSENGER THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE

WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY AT YOUR VOICE AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS

FOR WHEN DREAMS INCREASE AND WORDS GROW MANY THERE IS VANITY; BUT GOD IS THE ONE YOU MUST FEAR

IF YOU SEE IN A PROVINCE THE OPPRESSION OF THE POOR AND THE VIOLATION OF JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS DO NOT BE AMAZED AT THE MATTER FOR THE HIGH OFFICIAL IS WATCHED BY A HIGHER AND THERE ARE YET HIGHER ONES OVER THEM

BUT THIS IS GAIN FOR A LAND IN EVERY WAY A KING COMMITTED TO CULTIVATED FIELDS

HE WHO LOVES MONEY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH MONEY NOR HE WHO LOVES WEALTH WITH HIS INCOME; THIS ALSO IS VANITY

WHEN GOODS INCREASE THEY INCREASE WHO EAT THEM AND WHAT ADVANTAGE HAS THEIR OWNER BUT TO SEE THEM WITH HIS EYES

SWEET IS THE SLEEP OF A LABORER WHETHER HE EATS LITTLE OR MUCH BUT THE FULL STOMACH OF THE RICH WILL NOT LET HIM SLEEP

THERE IS A GRIEVOUS EVIL THAT I HAVE SEEN UNDER THE SUN RICHES WERE KEPT BY THEIR OWNER TO HIS HURT AND THOSE RICHES WERE LOST IN A BAD VENTURE

AND HE IS FATHER OF A SON BUT HE HAS NOTHING IN HIS HAND

AS HE CAME FROM HIS MOTHER'S WOMB HE SHALL GO AGAIN NAKED AS HE CAME AND SHALL TAKE NOTHING FOR HIS TOIL THAT HE MAY CARRY AWAY IN HIS HAND

THIS ALSO IS A GRIEVOUS EVIL JUST AS HE CAME SO SHALL HE GO AND WHAT GAIN IS THERE TO HIM WHO TOILS FOR THE WIND

MOREOVER ALL HIS DAYS HE EATS IN DARKNESS IN MUCH VEXATION AND SICKNESS AND ANGER

BEHOLD WHAT I HAVE SEEN TO BE GOOD AND FITTING IS TO EAT AND DRINK AND FIND ENJOYMENT IN ALL THE TOIL WITH WHICH ONE TOILS UNDER THE SUN THE FEW DAYS OF HIS LIFE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN HIM FOR THIS IS HIS LOT

EVERYONE ALSO TO WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN WEALTH AND POSSESSIONS AND POWER TO ENJOY THEM AND TO ACCEPT HIS LOT AND REJOICE IN HIS TOILTHIS IS THE GIFT OF GOD

FOR HE WILL NOT MUCH REMEMBER THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE GOD KEEPS HIM OCCUPIED WITH JOY IN HIS HEART

THERE IS AN EVIL THAT I HAVE SEEN UNDER THE SUN AND IT LIES HEAVY ON MANKIND A MAN TO WHOM GOD GIVES WEALTH POSSESSIONS AND HONOR SO THAT HE LACKS NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE DESIRES YET GOD DOES NOT GIVE HIM POWER TO ENJOY THEM BUT A STRANGER ENJOYS THEM

THIS IS VANITY; IT IS A GRIEVOUS EVIL

IF A MAN FATHERS A HUNDRED CHILDREN AND LIVES MANY YEARS SO THAT THE DAYS OF HIS YEARS ARE MANY BUT HIS SOUL IS NOT SATISFIED WITH LIFE'S GOOD THINGS AND HE ALSO HAS NO BURIAL I SAY THAT A STILLBORN CHILD IS BETTER OFF THAN HE

FOR IT COMES IN VANITY AND GOES IN DARKNESS AND IN DARKNESS ITS NAME IS COVERED

MOREOVER IT HAS NOT SEEN THE SUN OR KNOWN ANYTHING YET IT FINDS REST RATHER THAN HE

EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD LIVE A THOUSAND YEARS TWICE OVER YET ENJOY NO GOODDO NOT ALL GO TO THE ONE PLACE

ALL THE TOIL OF MAN IS FOR HIS MOUTH YET HIS APPETITE IS NOT SATISFIED

FOR WHAT ADVANTAGE HAS THE WISE MAN OVER THE FOOL

AND WHAT DOES THE POOR MAN HAVE WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONDUCT HIMSELF BEFORE THE LIVING

BETTER IS THE SIGHT OF THE EYES THAN THE WANDERING OF THE APPETITE THIS ALSO IS VANITY AND A STRIVING AFTER WIND

WHATEVER HAS COME TO BE HAS ALREADY BEEN NAMED AND IT IS KNOWN WHAT MAN IS AND THAT HE IS NOT ABLE TO DISPUTE WITH ONE STRONGER THAN HE

THE MORE WORDS THE MORE VANITY AND WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO MAN

FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOOD FOR MAN WHILE HE LIVES THE FEW DAYS OF HIS VAIN LIFE WHICH HE PASSES LIKE A SHADOW

FOR WHO CAN TELL MAN WHAT WILL BE AFTER HIM UNDER THE SUN

A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN PRECIOUS OINTMENT AND THE DAY OF DEATH THAN THE DAY OF BIRTH

IT IS BETTER TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING THAN TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF FEASTING FOR THIS IS THE END OF ALL MANKIND AND THE LIVING WILL LAY IT TO HEART

SORROW IS BETTER THAN LAUGHTER FOR BY SADNESS OF FACE THE HEART IS MADE GLAD

THE HEART OF THE WISE IS IN THE HOUSE OF MOURNING BUT THE HEART OF FOOLS IS IN THE HOUSE OF MIRTH

IT IS BETTER FOR A MAN TO HEAR THE REBUKE OF THE WISE THAN TO HEAR THE SONG OF FOOLS

FOR AS THE CRACKLING OF THORNS UNDER A POT SO IS THE LAUGHTER OF THE FOOLS; THIS ALSO IS VANITY

SURELY OPPRESSION DRIVES THE WISE INTO MADNESS AND A BRIBE CORRUPTS THE HEART

BETTER IS THE END OF A THING THAN ITS BEGINNING AND THE PATIENT IN SPIRIT IS BETTER THAN THE PROUD IN SPIRIT

BE NOT QUICK IN YOUR SPIRIT TO BECOME ANGRY FOR ANGER LODGES IN THE BOSOM OF FOOLS

SAY NOT WHY WERE THE FORMER DAYS BETTER THAN THESE

 FOR IT IS NOT FROM WISDOM THAT YOU ASK THIS

WISDOM IS GOOD WITH AN INHERITANCE AN ADVANTAGE TO THOSE WHO SEE THE SUN

FOR THE PROTECTION OF WISDOM IS LIKE THE PROTECTION OF MONEY AND THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWLEDGE IS THAT WISDOM PRESERVES THE LIFE OF HIM WHO HAS IT

CONSIDER THE WORK OF GOD WHO CAN MAKE STRAIGHT WHAT HE HAS MADE CROOKED

IN THE DAY OF PROSPERITY BE JOYFUL AND IN THE DAY OF ADVERSITY CONSIDER GOD HAS MADE THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER SO THAT MAN MAY NOT FIND OUT ANYTHING THAT WILL BE AFTER HIM

IN MY VAIN LIFE I HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING

THERE IS A RIGHTEOUS MAN WHO PERISHES IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THERE IS A WICKED MAN WHO PROLONGS HIS LIFE IN HIS EVILDOING

BE NOT OVERLY RIGHTEOUS AND DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF TOO WISE

WHY SHOULD YOU DESTROY YOURSELF

BE NOT OVERLY WICKED NEITHER BE A FOOL

WHY SHOULD YOU DIE BEFORE YOUR TIME

IT IS GOOD THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE HOLD OF THIS AND FROM THAT WITHHOLD NOT YOUR HAND FOR THE ONE WHO FEARS GOD SHALL COME OUT FROM BOTH OF THEM

WISDOM GIVES STRENGTH TO THE WISE MAN MORE THAN TEN RULERS WHO ARE IN A CITY

SURELY THERE IS NOT A RIGHTEOUS MAN ON EARTH WHO DOES GOOD AND NEVER SINS

DO NOT TAKE TO HEART ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAY LEST YOU HEAR YOUR SERVANT CURSING YOU

YOUR HEART KNOWS THAT MANY TIMES YOU HAVE YOURSELF CURSED OTHERS

ALL THIS I HAVE TESTED BY WISDOM

I SAID I WILL BE WISE BUT IT WAS FAR FROM ME

THAT WHICH HAS BEEN IS FAR OFF AND DEEP VERY DEEP; WHO CAN FIND IT OUT

I TURNED MY HEART TO KNOW AND TO SEARCH OUT AND TO SEEK WISDOM AND THE SCHEME OF THINGS AND TO KNOW THE WICKEDNESS OF FOLLY AND THE FOOLISHNESS THAT IS MADNESS

AND I FIND SOMETHING MORE BITTER THAN DEATH THE WOMAN WHOSE HEART IS SNARES AND NETS AND WHOSE HANDS ARE FETTERS

HE WHO PLEASES GOD ESCAPES HER BUT THE SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER

BEHOLD THIS IS WHAT I FOUND SAYS THE PREACHER WHILE ADDING ONE THING TO ANOTHER TO FIND THE SCHEME OF THINGS WHICH MY SOUL HAS SOUGHT REPEATEDLY BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND

ONE MAN AMONG A THOUSAND I FOUND BUT A WOMAN AMONG ALL THESE I HAVE NOT FOUND

SEE THIS ALONE I FOUND THAT GOD MADE MAN UPRIGHT BUT THEY HAVE SOUGHT OUT MANY SCHEMES

WHO IS LIKE THE WISE

AND WHO KNOWS THE INTERPRETATION OF A THING

A MAN'S WISDOM MAKES HIS FACE SHINE AND THE HARDNESS OF HIS FACE IS CHANGED

I SAY KEEP THE KING'S COMMAND BECAUSE OF GOD'S OATH TO HIM

BE NOT HASTY TO GO FROM HIS PRESENCE

DO NOT TAKE YOUR STAND IN AN EVIL CAUSE FOR HE DOES WHATEVER HE PLEASES

FOR THE WORD OF THE KING IS SUPREME AND WHO MAY SAY TO HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING

 WHOEVER KEEPS A COMMAND WILL KNOW NO EVIL THING AND THE WISE HEART WILL KNOW THE PROPER TIME AND THE JUST WAY

FOR THERE IS A TIME AND A WAY FOR EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH MAN'S TROUBLE LIES HEAVY ON HIM

FOR HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS TO BE FOR WHO CAN TELL HIM HOW IT WILL BE

NO MAN HAS POWER TO RETAIN THE SPIRIT OR POWER OVER THE DAY OF DEATH

THERE IS NO DISCHARGE FROM WAR NOR WILL WICKEDNESS DELIVER THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN TO IT

ALL THIS I OBSERVED WHILE APPLYING MY HEART TO ALL THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN WHEN MAN HAD POWER OVER MAN TO HIS HURT

THEN I SAW THE WICKED BURIED

THEY USED TO GO IN AND OUT OF THE HOLY PLACE AND WERE PRAISED IN THE CITY WHERE THEY HAD DONE SUCH THINGS

THIS ALSO IS VANITY

BECAUSE THE SENTENCE AGAINST AN EVIL DEED IS NOT EXECUTED SPEEDILY THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN IS FULLY SET TO DO EVIL

THOUGH A SINNER DOES EVIL A HUNDRED TIMES AND PROLONGS HIS LIFE YET I KNOW THAT IT WILL BE WELL WITH THOSE WHO FEAR GOD BECAUSE THEY FEAR BEFORE HIM

BUT IT WILL NOT BE WELL WITH THE WICKED NEITHER WILL HE PROLONG HIS DAYS LIKE A SHADOW BECAUSE HE DOES NOT FEAR BEFORE GOD

THERE IS A VANITY THAT TAKES PLACE ON EARTH THAT THERE ARE RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE TO WHOM IT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THE DEEDS OF THE WICKED AND THERE ARE WICKED PEOPLE TO WHOM IT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THE DEEDS OF THE RIGHTEOUS

I SAID THAT THIS ALSO IS VANITY

AND I COMMEND JOY FOR MAN HAS NO GOOD THING UNDER THE SUN BUT TO EAT AND DRINK AND BE JOYFUL FOR THIS WILL GO WITH HIM IN HIS TOIL THROUGH THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN HIM UNDER THE SUN

WHEN I APPLIED MY HEART TO KNOW WISDOM AND TO SEE THE BUSINESS THAT IS DONE ON EARTH HOW NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT DO ONE'S EYES SEE SLEEP THEN I SAW ALL THE WORK OF GOD THAT MAN CANNOT FIND OUT THE WORK THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN

HOWEVER MUCH MAN MAY TOIL IN SEEKING HE WILL NOT FIND IT OUT

EVEN THOUGH A WISE MAN CLAIMS TO KNOW HE CANNOT FIND IT OUT

BUT ALL THIS I LAID TO HEART EXAMINING IT ALL HOW THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WISE AND THEIR DEEDS ARE IN THE HAND OF GOD

WHETHER IT IS LOVE OR HATE MAN DOES NOT KNOW; BOTH ARE BEFORE HIM

IT IS THE SAME FOR ALL SINCE THE SAME EVENT HAPPENS TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED TO THE GOOD AND THE EVIL TO THE CLEAN AND THE UNCLEAN TO HIM WHO SACRIFICES AND HIM WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE

AS IS THE GOOD SO IS THE SINNER AND HE WHO SWEARS IS AS HE WHO SHUNS AN OATH

THIS IS AN EVIL IN ALL THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN THAT THE SAME EVENT HAPPENS TO ALL

ALSO THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN OF MAN ARE FULL OF EVIL AND MADNESS IS IN THEIR HEARTS WHILE THEY LIVE AND AFTER THAT THEY GO TO THE DEAD

BUT HE WHO IS JOINED WITH ALL THE LIVING HAS HOPE FOR A LIVING DOG IS BETTER THAN A DEAD LION

FOR THE LIVING KNOW THAT THEY WILL DIE BUT THE DEAD KNOW NOTHING AND THEY HAVE NO MORE REWARD FOR THE MEMORY OF THEM IS FORGOTTEN

THEIR LOVE AND THEIR HATE AND THEIR ENVY HAVE ALREADY PERISHED AND FOREVER THEY HAVE NO MORE SHARE IN ALL THAT IS DONE UNDER THE SUN

GO EAT YOUR BREAD IN JOY AND DRINK YOUR WINE WITH A MERRY HEART FOR GOD HAS ALREADY APPROVED WHAT YOU DO

LET YOUR GARMENTS BE ALWAYS WHITE

LET NOT OIL BE LACKING ON YOUR HEAD

ENJOY LIFE WITH THE WIFE WHOM YOU LOVE ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR VAIN LIFE THAT HE HAS GIVEN YOU UNDER THE SUN BECAUSE THAT IS YOUR PORTION IN LIFE AND IN YOUR TOIL AT WHICH YOU TOIL UNDER THE SUN

WHATEVER YOUR HAND FINDS TO DO DO IT WITH YOUR MIGHT FOR THERE IS NO WORK OR THOUGHT OR KNOWLEDGE OR WISDOM IN SHEOL TO WHICH YOU ARE GOING

AGAIN I SAW THAT UNDER THE SUN THE RACE IS NOT TO THE SWIFT NOR THE BATTLE TO THE STRONG NOR BREAD TO THE WISE NOR RICHES TO THE INTELLIGENT NOR FAVOR TO THOSE WITH KNOWLEDGE BUT TIME AND CHANCE HAPPEN TO THEM ALL

FOR MAN DOES NOT KNOW HIS TIME

LIKE FISH THAT ARE TAKEN IN AN EVIL NET AND LIKE BIRDS THAT ARE CAUGHT IN A SNARE SO THE CHILDREN OF MAN ARE SNARED AT AN EVIL TIME WHEN IT SUDDENLY FALLS UPON THEM

I HAVE ALSO SEEN THIS EXAMPLE OF WISDOM UNDER THE SUN AND IT SEEMED GREAT TO ME

THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW MEN IN IT AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT AND BESIEGED IT BUILDING GREAT SIEGEWORKS AGAINST IT

BUT THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A POOR WISE MAN AND HE BY HIS WISDOM DELIVERED THE CITY

YET NO ONE REMEMBERED THAT POOR MAN

BUT I SAY THAT WISDOM IS BETTER THAN MIGHT THOUGH THE POOR MAN'S WISDOM IS DESPISED AND HIS WORDS ARE NOT HEARD

THE WORDS OF THE WISE HEARD IN QUIET ARE BETTER THAN THE SHOUTING OF A RULER AMONG FOOLS

WISDOM IS BETTER THAN WEAPONS OF WAR BUT ONE SINNER DESTROYS MUCH GOOD

DEAD FLIES MAKE THE PERFUMER'S OINTMENT GIVE OFF A STENCH; SO A LITTLE FOLLY OUTWEIGHS WISDOM AND HONOR

A WISE MAN'S HEART INCLINES HIM TO THE RIGHT BUT A FOOL'S HEART TO THE LEFT

EVEN WHEN THE FOOL WALKS ON THE ROAD HE LACKS SENSE AND HE SAYS TO EVERYONE THAT HE IS A FOOL

IF THE ANGER OF THE RULER RISES AGAINST YOU DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PLACE FOR CALMNESS WILL LAY GREAT OFFENSES TO REST

THERE IS AN EVIL THAT I HAVE SEEN UNDER THE SUN AS IT WERE AN ERROR PROCEEDING FROM THE RULER FOLLY IS SET IN MANY HIGH PLACES AND THE RICH SIT IN A LOW PLACE

I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSES AND PRINCES WALKING ON THE GROUND LIKE SLAVES

HE WHO DIGS A PIT WILL FALL INTO IT AND A SERPENT WILL BITE HIM WHO BREAKS THROUGH A WALL

HE WHO QUARRIES STONES IS HURT BY THEM AND HE WHO SPLITS LOGS IS ENDANGERED BY THEM

IF THE IRON IS BLUNT AND ONE DOES NOT SHARPEN THE EDGE HE MUST USE MORE STRENGTH BUT WISDOM HELPS ONE TO SUCCEED

IF THE SERPENT BITES BEFORE IT IS CHARMED THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO THE CHARMER

THE WORDS OF A WISE MAN'S MOUTH WIN HIM FAVOR BUT THE LIPS OF A FOOL CONSUME HIM

THE BEGINNING OF THE WORDS OF HIS MOUTH IS FOOLISHNESS AND THE END OF HIS TALK IS EVIL MADNESS

A FOOL MULTIPLIES WORDS THOUGH NO MAN KNOWS WHAT IS TO BE AND WHO CAN TELL HIM WHAT WILL BE AFTER HIM

THE TOIL OF A FOOL WEARIES HIM FOR HE DOES NOT KNOW THE WAY TO THE CITY

WOE TO YOU O LAND WHEN YOUR KING IS A CHILD AND YOUR PRINCES FEAST IN THE MORNING

HAPPY ARE YOU O LAND WHEN YOUR KING IS THE SON OF THE NOBILITY AND YOUR PRINCES FEAST AT THE PROPER TIME FOR STRENGTH AND NOT FOR DRUNKENNESS

THROUGH SLOTH THE ROOF SINKS IN AND THROUGH INDOLENCE THE HOUSE LEAKS

BREAD IS MADE FOR LAUGHTER AND WINE GLADDENS LIFE AND MONEY ANSWERS EVERYTHING

EVEN IN YOUR THOUGHT DO NOT CURSE THE KING NOR IN YOUR BEDROOM CURSE THE RICH FOR A BIRD OF THE AIR WILL CARRY YOUR VOICE OR SOME WINGED CREATURE TELL THE MATTER

CAST YOUR BREAD UPON THE WATERS FOR YOU WILL FIND IT AFTER MANY DAYS

GIVE A PORTION TO SEVEN OR EVEN TO EIGHT FOR YOU KNOW NOT WHAT DISASTER MAY HAPPEN ON EARTH

IF THE CLOUDS ARE FULL OF RAIN THEY EMPTY THEMSELVES ON THE EARTH AND IF A TREE FALLS TO THE SOUTH OR TO THE NORTH IN THE PLACE WHERE THE TREE FALLS THERE IT WILL LIE

HE WHO OBSERVES THE WIND WILL NOT SOW AND HE WHO REGARDS THE CLOUDS WILL NOT REAP

AS YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAY THE SPIRIT COMES TO THE BONES IN THE WOMB OF A WOMAN WITH CHILD SO YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WORK OF GOD WHO MAKES EVERYTHING

IN THE MORNING SOW YOUR SEED AND AT EVENING WITHHOLD NOT YOUR HAND FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH WILL PROSPER THIS OR THAT OR WHETHER BOTH ALIKE WILL BE GOOD

LIGHT IS SWEET AND IT IS PLEASANT FOR THE EYES TO SEE THE SUN

SO IF A PERSON LIVES MANY YEARS LET HIM REJOICE IN THEM ALL; BUT LET HIM REMEMBER THAT THE DAYS OF DARKNESS WILL BE MANY

ALL THAT COMES IS VANITY

REJOICE O YOUNG MAN IN YOUR YOUTH AND LET YOUR HEART CHEER YOU IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH

WALK IN THE WAYS OF YOUR HEART AND THE SIGHT OF YOUR EYES

BUT KNOW THAT FOR ALL THESE THINGS GOD WILL BRING YOU INTO JUDGMENT

REMOVE VEXATION FROM YOUR HEART AND PUT AWAY PAIN FROM YOUR BODY FOR YOUTH AND THE DAWN OF LIFE ARE VANITY

REMEMBER ALSO YOUR CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS COME AND THE YEARS DRAW NEAR OF WHICH YOU WILL SAY I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THEM; BEFORE THE SUN AND THE LIGHT AND THE MOON AND THE STARS ARE DARKENED AND THE CLOUDS RETURN AFTER THE RAIN IN THE DAY WHEN THE KEEPERS OF THE HOUSE TREMBLE AND THE STRONG MEN ARE BENT AND THE GRINDERS CEASE BECAUSE THEY ARE FEW AND THOSE WHO LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS ARE DIMMED AND THE DOORS ON THE STREET ARE SHUTWHEN THE SOUND OF THE GRINDING IS LOW AND ONE RISES UP AT THE SOUND OF A BIRD AND ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF SONG ARE BROUGHT LOW THEY ARE AFRAID ALSO OF WHAT IS HIGH AND TERRORS ARE IN THE WAY; THE ALMOND TREE BLOSSOMS THE GRASSHOPPER DRAGS ITSELF ALONG AND DESIRE FAILS BECAUSE MAN IS GOING TO HIS ETERNAL HOME AND THE MOURNERS GO ABOUT THE STREETS BEFORE THE SILVER CORD IS SNAPPED OR THE GOLDEN BOWL IS BROKEN OR THE PITCHER IS SHATTERED AT THE FOUNTAIN OR THE WHEEL BROKEN AT THE CISTERN AND THE DUST RETURNS TO THE EARTH AS IT WAS AND THE SPIRIT RETURNS TO GOD WHO GAVE IT

VANITY OF VANITIES SAYS THE PREACHER; ALL IS VANITY

BESIDES BEING WISE THE PREACHER ALSO TAUGHT THE PEOPLE KNOWLEDGE WEIGHING AND STUDYING AND ARRANGING MANY PROVERBS WITH GREAT CARE

THE PREACHER SOUGHT TO FIND WORDS OF DELIGHT AND UPRIGHTLY HE WROTE WORDS OF TRUTH

THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS AND LIKE NAILS FIRMLY FIXED ARE THE COLLECTED SAYINGS; THEY ARE GIVEN BY ONE SHEPHERD

MY SON BEWARE OF ANYTHING BEYOND THESE

OF MAKING MANY BOOKS THERE IS NO END AND MUCH STUDY IS A WEARINESS OF THE FLESH

THE END OF THE MATTER; ALL HAS BEEN HEARD

FEAR GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS FOR THIS IS THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN

FOR GOD WILL BRING EVERY DEED INTO JUDGMENT WITH EVERY SECRET THING WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL
