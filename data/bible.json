NONE
THAT
COULD
INTERPRET
THEM
UNTO
PHARAOH
THEN
SPAKE
THE
CHIEF
BUTLER
UNTO
PHARAOH
SAYING
I
DO
REMEMBER
MY
FAULTS
THIS
DAY
PHARAOH
WAS
WROTH
WITH
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
PUT
ME
IN
WARD
IN
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
GUARD'S
HOUSE
BOTH
ME
AND
THE
CHIEF
BAKER
AND
WE
DREAMED
A
DREAM
IN
ONE
NIGHT
I
AND
HE
WE
DREAMED
EACH
MAN
ACCORDING
TO
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
HIS
DREAM
AND
THERE
WAS
THERE
WITH
US
A
YOUNG
MAN
AN
HEBREW
SERVANT
TO
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
GUARD
AND
WE
TOLD
HIM
AND
HE
INTERPRETED
TO
US
OUR
DREAMS
TO
EACH
MAN
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
DREAM
HE
DID
INTERPRET
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
INTERPRETED
TO
US
SO
IT
WAS
ME
HE
RESTORED
UNTO
MINE
OFFICE
AND
HIM
HE
HANGED
THEN
PHARAOH
SENT
AND
CALLED
JOSEPH
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
HIM
HASTILY
OUT
OF
THE
DUNGEON
AND
HE
SHAVED
HIMSELF
AND
CHANGED
HIS
RAIMENT
AND
CAME
IN
UNTO
PHARAOH
AND
PHARAOH
SAID
UNTO
JOSEPH
I
HAVE
DREAMED
A
DREAM
AND
THERE
IS
NONE
THAT
CAN
INTERPRET
IT
AND
I
HAVE
HEARD
SAY
OF
THEE
THAT
THOU
CANST
UNDERSTAND
A
DREAM
TO
INTERPRET
IT
AND
JOSEPH
ANSWERED
PHARAOH
SAYING
IT
IS
NOT
IN
ME
GOD
SHALL
GIVE
PHARAOH
AN
ANSWER
OF
PEACE
AND
PHARAOH
SAID
UNTO
JOSEPH
IN
MY
DREAM
BEHOLD
I
STOOD
UPON
THE
BANK
OF
THE
RIVER
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
CAME
UP
OUT
OF
THE
RIVER
SEVEN
KINE
FATFLESHED
AND
WELL
FAVOURED
AND
THEY
FED
IN
A
MEADOW
AND
BEHOLD
SEVEN
OTHER
KINE
CAME
UP
AFTER
THEM
POOR
AND
VERY
ILL
FAVOURED
AND
LEANFLESHED
SUCH
AS
I
NEVER
SAW
IN
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
FOR
BADNESS
AND
THE
LEAN
AND
THE
ILL
FAVOURED
KINE
DID
EAT
UP
THE
FIRST
SEVEN
FAT
KINE
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
EATEN
THEM
UP
IT
COULD
NOT
BE
KNOWN
THAT
THEY
HAD
EATEN
THEM
BUT
THEY
WERE
STILL
ILL
FAVOURED
AS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
SO
I
AWOKE
AND
I
SAW
IN
MY
DREAM
AND
BEHOLD
SEVEN
EARS
CAME
UP
IN
ONE
STALK
FULL
AND
GOOD
AND
BEHOLD
SEVEN
EARS
WITHERED
THIN
AND
BLASTED
WITH
THE
EAST
WIND
SPRUNG
UP
AFTER
THEM
AND
THE
THIN
EARS
DEVOURED
THE
SEVEN
GOOD
EARS
AND
I
TOLD
THIS
UNTO
THE
MAGICIANS
BUT
THERE
WAS
NONE
THAT
COULD
DECLARE
IT
TO
ME
AND
JOSEPH
SAID
UNTO
PHARAOH
THE
DREAM
OF
PHARAOH
IS
ONE
GOD
HATH
SHEWED
PHARAOH
WHAT
HE
IS
ABOUT
TO
DO
THE
SEVEN
GOOD
KINE
ARE
SEVEN
YEARS
AND
THE
SEVEN
GOOD
EARS
ARE
SEVEN
YEARS
THE
DREAM
IS
ONE
AND
THE
SEVEN
THIN
AND
ILL
FAVOURED
KINE
THAT
CAME
UP
AFTER
THEM
ARE
SEVEN
YEARS
AND
THE
SEVEN
EMPTY
EARS
BLASTED
WITH
THE
EAST
WIND
SHALL
BE
SEVEN
YEARS
OF
FAMINE
THIS
IS
THE
THING
WHICH
I
HAVE
SPOKEN
UNTO
PHARAOH
WHAT
GOD
IS
ABOUT
TO
DO
HE
SHEWETH
UNTO
PHARAOH
BEHOLD
THERE
COME
SEVEN
YEARS
OF
GREAT
PLENTY
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
AND
THERE
SHALL
ARISE
AFTER
THEM
SEVEN
YEARS
OF
FAMINE
AND
ALL
THE
PLENTY
SHALL
BE
FORGOTTEN
IN
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
AND
THE
FAMINE
SHALL
CONSUME
THE
LAND
AND
THE
PLENTY
SHALL
NOT
BE
KNOWN
IN
THE
LAND
BY
REASON
OF
THAT
FAMINE
FOLLOWING
FOR
IT
SHALL
BE
VERY
GRIEVOUS
AND
FOR
THAT
THE
DREAM
WAS
DOUBLED
UNTO
PHARAOH
TWICE
IT
IS
BECAUSE
THE
THING
IS
ESTABLISHED
BY
GOD
AND
GOD
WILL
SHORTLY
BRING
IT
TO
PASS
NOW
THEREFORE
LET
PHARAOH
LOOK
OUT
A
MAN
DISCREET
AND
WISE
AND
SET
HIM
OVER
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
LET
PHARAOH
DO
THIS
AND
LET
HIM
APPOINT
OFFICERS
OVER
THE
LAND
AND
TAKE
UP
THE
FIFTH
PART
OF
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
IN
THE
SEVEN
PLENTEOUS
YEARS
AND
LET
THEM
GATHER
ALL
THE
FOOD
OF
THOSE
GOOD
YEARS
THAT
COME
AND
LAY
UP
CORN
UNDER
THE
HAND
OF
PHARAOH
AND
LET
THEM
KEEP
FOOD
IN
THE
CITIES
AND
THAT
FOOD
SHALL
BE
FOR
STORE
TO
THE
LAND
AGAINST
THE
SEVEN
YEARS
OF
FAMINE
WHICH
SHALL
BE
IN
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
THAT
THE
LAND
PERISH
NOT
THROUGH
THE
FAMINE
AND
THE
THING
WAS
GOOD
IN
THE
EYES
OF
PHARAOH
AND
IN
THE
EYES
OF
ALL
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
PHARAOH
SAID
UNTO
HIS
SERVANTS
CAN
WE
FIND
SUCH
A
ONE
AS
THIS
IS
A
MAN
IN
WHOM
THE
SPIRIT
OF

GRIEVED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF

AND
THE
EGYPTIANS
MADE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL

SERVE
WITH
RIGOUR
AND
THEY
MADE
THEIR

IN
ALL
MANNER
OF
SERVICE
IN

LIVE
BUT
THE
MIDWIVES
FEARED
GOD
AND
DID
NOT
AS
THE
KING
OF

COMMANDED
THEM
BUT
SAVED
THE
MEN
CHILDREN
ALIVE
AND
THE
KING
OF
EGYPT
CALLED
FOR
THE
MIDWIVES
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
HAVE
YE
DONE
THIS
THING
AND
HAVE
SAVED
THE
MEN
CHILDREN
ALIVE
AND
THE
MIDWIVES
SAID
UNTO
PHARAOH
BECAUSE

EGYPTIAN
WOMEN
FOR
THEY
ARE
LIVELY
AND
ARE
DELIVERED
ERE
THE
MIDWIVES
COME

THEREFORE
GOD
DEALT
WELL
WITH
THE
MIDWIVES
AND
THE
PEOPLE
MULTIPLIED
AND
WAXED
VERY
MIGHTY
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
BECAUSE

MIDWIVES
FEARED
GOD
THAT

HOUSES
AND
PHARAOH
CHARGED
ALL
HIS
PEOPLE
SAYING
EVERY
SON
THAT
IS
BORN

CAME
DOWN
TO
WASH
HERSELF
AT
THE
RIVER
AND
HER
MAIDENS
WALKED
ALONG
BY
THE
RIVER'S

AND
WHEN
SHE
SAW
THE
ARK
AMONG

SHE
SENT

WEPT
AND
SHE
HAD
COMPASSION
ON

OF
THE
HEBREW
WOMEN

SHE
BROUGHT
HIM
UNTO
PHARAOH'S
DAUGHTER
AND
HE
BECAME
HER
SON
AND
SHE
CALLED
HIS
NAME
MOSES
AND
SHE
SAID
BECAUSE
I
DREW
HIM
OUT
OF

IN
THOSE
DAYS
WHEN
MOSES
WAS

AND
LOOKED
ON

AND
HE
SPIED
AN

SMITING
AN

ONE
OF
HIS

AND
HE
LOOKED
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT
WAY
AND
WHEN
HE
SAW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
MAN
HE
SLEW
THE
EGYPTIAN
AND
HID
HIM
IN
THE
SAND
AND
WHEN
HE
WENT
OUT
THE
SECOND
DAY
BEHOLD
TWO
MEN
OF
THE
HEBREWS
STROVE
TOGETHER
AND
HE
SAID
TO
HIM
THAT

THE
WRONG
WHEREFORE
SMITEST

KILLEDST
THE

HE
SOUGHT
TO
SLAY
MOSES
BUT
MOSES
FLED
FROM
THE
FACE
OF
PHARAOH
AND
DWELT
IN
THE
LAND
OF
MIDIAN
AND
HE
SAT
DOWN
BY
A

NOW
THE
PRIEST

BUT
MOSES
STOOD
UP

WHERE

WHY
IS
IT
THAT
YE
HAVE
LEFT
THE
MAN
CALL

AND
SHE
BARE

A
SON
AND
HE
CALLED
HIS
NAME
GERSHOM
FOR

HAVE
BEEN
A

HE
THAT
GATHERED

HAD
NOTHING

AND
HE
THAT
GATHERED
LITTLE
HAD
NO
LACK
THEY
GATHERED
EVERY

ACCORDING

BUT
ON
THE
SEVENTH

WHICH
IS
THE

IN

NONE
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
THERE
WENT
OUT
SOME
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
SEVENTH
DAY
FOR
TO
GATHER
AND
THEY
FOUND
NONE
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO

HOW
LONG
REFUSE
YE
TO
KEEP
MY
COMMANDMENTS
AND
MY
LAWS
SEE
FOR
THAT
THE

DAYS
ABIDE

SO
THE

RESTED
ON
THE
SEVENTH

AND
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
CALLED
THE

THEREOF
MANNA
AND
IT
WAS

MADE
WITH
HONEY
AND
MOSES
SAID
THIS
IS
THE

WHICH
THE
LORD
COMMANDETH
FILL
AN

OF

KEPT
FOR
YOUR

WHEREWITH
I
HAVE
FED

THEREIN
AND
LAY

FORTY

NOW
AN

DRINK
WHEREFORE
THE

DID
CHIDE
WITH

AND
SAID
GIVE

AND
MOSES
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY

WHEREFORE
DO

TEMPT
THE
LORD
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THIRSTED
THERE
FOR

THOU
HAST
BROUGHT
US
UP
OUT
OF

TO
KILL
US
AND
OUR

AND
MOSES
CRIED
UNTO
THE
LORD
SAYING
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
UNTO
THIS
PEOPLE
THEY
BE
ALMOST
READY
TO
STONE
ME
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
MOSES
GO
ON
BEFORE
THE
PEOPLE
AND
TAKE
WITH
THEE
OF
THE
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
AND

AND
THOU
SHALT
SMITE
THE
ROCK
AND
THERE
SHALL
COME
WATER
OUT
OF
IT
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
MAY
DRINK
AND
MOSES
DID
SO
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
AND
HE
CALLED
THE
NAME
OF
THE
PLACE
MASSAH
AND
MERIBAH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHIDING
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
TEMPTED
THE
LORD
SAYING
IS
THE
LORD
AMONG
US
OR

THEN
CAME
AMALEK
AND
FOUGHT
WITH
ISRAEL
IN
REPHIDIM
AND
MOSES
SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
CHOOSE

I

SAID
TO
HIM
AND
FOUGHT
WITH
AMALEK
AND
MOSES
AARON
AND
HUR
WENT
UP

PASS
WHEN
MOSES
HELD
UP
HIS

THAT
ISRAEL
PREVAILED
AND
WHEN
HE
LET
DOWN
HIS

AMALEK
PREVAILED
BUT
MOSES
HANDS
WERE
HEAVY
AND
THEY
TOOK
A

AND
PUT

AND
JOSHUA
DISCOMFITED
AMALEK

FATHER
BEARETH
THE
SUCKING
CHILD
UNTO

UNTO
ALL
THIS
PEOPLE

SAYING
GIVE

MAY
EAT
I
AM
NOT

ALL
THIS
PEOPLE
ALONE

THOU
DEAL
THUS
WITH

KILL
ME
I
PRAY
THEE
OUT
OF

IF
I
HAVE
FOUND
FAVOUR
IN
THY
SIGHT
AND
LET
ME
NOT
SEE
MY
WRETCHEDNESS
AND
THE

SAID
UNTO
MOSES
GATHER
UNTO

SEVENTY

WHOM
THOU
KNOWEST

WITH
YOU
IN
THE
MOUNT
OUT
OF
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
FIRE
IN
THE
DAY
OF
THE
ASSEMBLY
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THE
END
OF
FORTY
DAYS
AND
FORTY
NIGHTS
THAT
THE
LORD
GAVE
ME
THE
TWO
TABLES
OF
STONE
EVEN
THE
TABLES
OF
THE
COVENANT
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
ME
ARISE
GET
THEE
DOWN
QUICKLY
FROM
HENCE
FOR
THY
PEOPLE
WHICH
THOU
HAST
BROUGHT
FORTH
OUT
OF
EGYPT
HAVE
CORRUPTED
THEMSELVES
THEY
ARE
QUICKLY
TURNED
ASIDE
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
WHICH
I
COMMANDED
THEM
THEY
HAVE
MADE
THEM
A
MOLTEN
IMAGE
FURTHERMORE
THE
LORD
SPAKE
UNTO
ME
SAYING
I
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
PEOPLE
AND
BEHOLD
IT
IS
A
STIFFNECKED
PEOPLE
LET
ME
ALONE
THAT
I
MAY
DESTROY
THEM
AND
BLOT
OUT
THEIR
NAME
FROM
UNDER
HEAVEN
AND
I
WILL
MAKE
OF
THEE
A
NATION
MIGHTIER
AND
GREATER
THAN
THEY
SO
I
TURNED
AND
CAME
DOWN
FROM
THE
MOUNT
AND
THE
MOUNT
BURNED
WITH
FIRE
AND
THE
TWO
TABLES
OF
THE
COVENANT
WERE
IN
MY
TWO
HANDS
AND
I
LOOKED
AND
BEHOLD
YE
HAD
SINNED
AGAINST
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
AND
HAD
MADE
YOU
A
MOLTEN
CALF
YE
HAD
TURNED
ASIDE
QUICKLY
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
WHICH
THE
LORD
HAD
COMMANDED
YOU
AND
I
TOOK
THE
TWO
TABLES
AND
CAST
THEM
OUT
OF
MY
TWO
HANDS
AND
BRAKE
THEM
BEFORE
YOUR
EYES
AND
I
FELL
DOWN
BEFORE
THE
LORD
AS
AT
THE
FIRST
FORTY
DAYS
AND
FORTY
NIGHTS
I
DID
NEITHER
EAT
BREAD
NOR
DRINK
WATER
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
YOUR
SINS
WHICH
YE
SINNED
IN
DOING
WICKEDLY
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
TO
PROVOKE
HIM
TO
ANGER
FOR
I
WAS
AFRAID
OF
THE
ANGER
AND
HOT
DISPLEASURE
WHEREWITH
THE
LORD
WAS
WROTH
AGAINST
YOU
TO
DESTROY
YOU
BUT
THE
LORD
HEARKENED
UNTO
ME
AT
THAT
TIME
ALSO
AND
THE
LORD
WAS
VERY
ANGRY
WITH
AARON
TO
HAVE
DESTROYED
HIM
AND
I
PRAYED
FOR
AARON
ALSO
THE
SAME
TIME
AND
I
TOOK
YOUR
SIN
THE
CALF
WHICH
YE
HAD
MADE
AND
BURNT
IT
WITH
FIRE
AND
STAMPED
IT
AND
GROUND
IT
VERY
SMALL
EVEN
UNTIL
IT
WAS
AS
SMALL
AS
DUST
AND
I
CAST
THE
DUST
THEREOF
INTO
THE
BROOK
THAT
DESCENDED
OUT
OF
THE
MOUNT
AND
AT
TABERAH
AND
AT
MASSAH
AND
AT
KIBROTHHATTAAVAH
YE
PROVOKED
THE
LORD
TO
WRATH
LIKEWISE
WHEN
THE
LORD
SENT
YOU
FROM
KADESHBARNEA
SAYING
GO
UP
AND
POSSESS
THE
LAND
WHICH
I
HAVE
GIVEN
YOU
THEN
YE
REBELLED
AGAINST
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
AND
YE
BELIEVED
HIM
NOT
NOR
HEARKENED
TO
HIS
VOICE
YE
HAVE
BEEN
REBELLIOUS
AGAINST
THE
LORD
FROM
THE
DAY
THAT
I
KNEW
YOU
THUS
I
FELL
DOWN
BEFORE
THE
LORD
FORTY
DAYS
AND
FORTY
NIGHTS
AS
I
FELL
DOWN
AT
THE
FIRST
BECAUSE
THE
LORD
HAD
SAID
HE
WOULD
DESTROY
YOU
I
PRAYED
THEREFORE
UNTO
THE
LORD

PEOPLE
NOR
TO
THEIR
WICKEDNESS
NOR
TO
THEIR
SIN
LEST
THE
LAND
WHENCE
THOU
BROUGHTEST
US
OUT
SAY
BECAUSE
THE
LORD
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
BRING
THEM
INTO
THE
LAND
WHICH
HE
PROMISED
THEM
AND
BECAUSE
HE
HATED
THEM

WERE
COME
UP
OUT
OF

AND
THE

THAT
THE

AS

ON
THE

SAYING
WHEN
YOUR

SHALL
ASK
THEIR

THEN
YE
SHALL
LET
YOUR

KNOW
SAYING
ISRAEL
CAME
OVER
THIS
JORDAN
ON
DRY
LAND
FOR
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
DRIED
UP
THE
WATERS
OF
JORDAN
FROM
BEFORE
YOU
UNTIL
YE
WERE
PASSED
OVER
AS
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
DID
TO
THE
RED
SEA
WHICH
HE
DRIED
UP
FROM
BEFORE
US
UNTIL
WE
WERE
GONE
OVER
THAT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
EARTH
MIGHT
KNOW
THE
HAND
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
IT
IS
MIGHTY
THAT
YE
MIGHT
FEAR
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
FOR
EVER
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
ALL
THE
KINGS
OF
THE
AMORITES
WHICH
WERE
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
JORDAN
WESTWARD
AND
ALL
THE
KINGS
OF
THE
CANAANITES
WHICH
WERE
BY
THE
SEA
HEARD
THAT
THE
LORD
HAD
DRIED
UP
THE
WATERS
OF
JORDAN
FROM
BEFORE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
UNTIL
WE
WERE
PASSED
OVER
THAT
THEIR
HEART
MELTED
NEITHER
WAS
THERE
SPIRIT
IN
THEM
ANY
MORE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AT
THAT
TIME
THE

SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
MAKE
THEE
SHARP
KNIVES
AND
CIRCUMCISE
AGAIN
THE

THE
SECOND

AND
JOSHUA
MADE
HIM
SHARP
KNIVES
AND
CIRCUMCISED
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AT
THE
HILL
OF
THE
FORESKINS
AND
THIS
IS
THE
CAUSE
WHY
JOSHUA
DID
CIRCUMCISE
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
CAME
OUT
OF
EGYPT
THAT
WERE
MALES
EVEN
ALL
THE
MEN
OF
WAR
DIED
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
BY
THE
WAY
AFTER
THEY
CAME
OUT
OF
EGYPT
NOW
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
CAME
OUT
WERE
CIRCUMCISED
BUT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
BORN
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
BY
THE
WAY
AS
THEY
CAME
FORTH
OUT
OF
EGYPT
THEM
THEY
HAD
NOT
CIRCUMCISED
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
WALKED
FORTY
YEARS
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
TILL
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
MEN
OF
WAR
WHICH
CAME
OUT
OF
EGYPT
WERE
CONSUMED
BECAUSE
THEY
OBEYED
NOT
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
LORD
UNTO
WHOM
THE
LORD
SWARE
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
SHEW
THEM
THE
LAND
WHICH
THE
LORD
SWARE
UNTO
THEIR
FATHERS
THAT
HE
WOULD
GIVE
US
A
LAND
THAT
FLOWETH
WITH
MILK
AND
HONEY
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
WHOM
HE
RAISED
UP
IN
THEIR
STEAD
THEM
JOSHUA
CIRCUMCISED
FOR
THEY
WERE
UNCIRCUMCISED
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
NOT
CIRCUMCISED
THEM
BY
THE
WAY
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THEY
HAD
DONE
CIRCUMCISING
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
ABODE
IN
THEIR
PLACES
IN
THE
CAMP
TILL
THEY
WERE
WHOLE
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
THIS
DAY
HAVE
I
ROLLED
AWAY
THE
REPROACH
OF
EGYPT
FROM
OFF
YOU
WHEREFORE
THE
NAME
OF
THE

ON
THE

AFTER
THE
PASSOVER
UNLEAVENED
CAKES
AND
PARCHED
CORN
IN
THE
SELFSAME
DAY
AND
THE
MANNA
CEASED
ON
THE
MORROW
AFTER
THEY
HAD
EATEN
OF
THE
OLD
CORN
OF
THE
LAND
NEITHER
HAD
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
MANNA
ANY
MORE
BUT
THEY
DID
EAT
OF
THE
FRUIT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
CANAAN
THAT
YEAR
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
JOSHUA
WAS
BY
JERICHO
THAT
HE
LIFTED
UP
HIS
EYES
AND
LOOKED
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
STOOD
A
MAN
OVER
AGAINST
HIM
WITH
HIS
SWORD
DRAWN
IN
HIS
HAND
AND
JOSHUA
WENT
UNTO
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ART
THOU
FOR
US
OR
FOR
OUR
ADVERSARIES
AND
HE
SAID
NAY
BUT
AS
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
HOST
OF
THE
LORD
AM
I
NOW
COME
AND
JOSHUA
FELL
ON
HIS
FACE
TO
THE
EARTH
AND
DID
WORSHIP
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
SAITH
MY
LORD
UNTO
HIS
SERVANT
AND
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
LORD'S
HOST
SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
LOOSE
THY
SHOE
FROM
OFF
THY
FOOT
FOR
THE
PLACE
WHEREON
THOU
STANDEST
IS
HOLY
AND
JOSHUA
DID
SO
NOW
JERICHO
WAS
STRAITLY
SHUT
UP
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
NONE
WENT
OUT
AND
NONE
CAME
IN
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
SEE
I
HAVE
GIVEN
INTO
THINE
HAND
JERICHO
AND
THE
KING
THEREOF
AND
THE
MIGHTY
MEN
OF

TRUMPETS
AND
IT
SHALL
COME
TO

THAT
WHEN
THEY
MAKE
A
LONG
BLAST
WITH
THE
RAM'S
HORN
AND
WHEN
YE
HEAR
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
TRUMPET
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
SHALL
SHOUT
WITH
A
GREAT
SHOUT
AND
THE
WALL
OF
THE
CITY
SHALL
FALL
DOWN
FLAT
AND
THE
PEOPLE
SHALL
ASCEND
UP
EVERY
MAN
STRAIGHT
BEFORE
HIM
AND
JOSHUA
THE
SON
OF
NUN
CALLED
THE
PRIESTS
AND
SAID
UNTO

TAKE
UP
THE
ARK
OF
THE
COVENANT
AND

I
BID
YOU
SHOUT
THEN

SHOUT
SO
THE
ARK
OF
THE
LORD
COMPASSED
THE
CITY
GOING
ABOUT
IT
ONCE
AND
THEY
CAME
INTO
THE
CAMP
AND
LODGED
IN

ONLY
RAHAB
THE

WHEN
THE

HEARD
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
TRUMPET
AND
THE

SHOUTED
WITH
A
GREAT
SHOUT
THAT
THE

SO
THAT
THE

EVERY

ALIVE
AND
HER
FATHER'S
HOUSEHOLD
AND
ALL
THAT
SHE
HAD
AND
SHE
DWELLETH
IN

EVEN
UNTO
THIS

BECAUSE
SHE
HID
THE
MESSENGERS
WHICH
JOSHUA
SENT
TO

OUT
JERICHO
AND
JOSHUA
ADJURED
THEM
AT
THAT
TIME
SAYING

THEREOF
IN
HIS
FIRSTBORN
AND
IN
HIS
YOUNGEST
SON
SHALL
HE
SET
UP
THE
GATES
OF

SO
THE

WAS
WITH
JOSHUA
AND
HIS
FAME
WAS

THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
COUNTRY
BUT
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL

TOOK
OF
THE

AND
THE
ANGER
OF
THE

WAS
KINDLED
AGAINST

AND
JOSHUA
SENT
MEN
FROM

WHICH
IS
BESIDE
BETHAVEN
ON
THE
EAST
OF
BETHEL
AND
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
SAYING
GO
UP
AND
VIEW
THE

AND
THE
MEN
WENT
UP
AND
VIEWED
AI
AND
THEY
RETURNED
TO
JOSHUA
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
LET
NOT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
GO
UP
BUT
LET
ABOUT
TWO
OR
THREE
THOUSAND
MEN
GO
UP
AND
SMITE
AI
AND
MAKE
NOT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
TO
LABOUR
THITHER
FOR

THITHER
OF
THE

ABOUT
THREE
THOUSAND
MEN

THEY
FLED
BEFORE
THE
MEN
OF
AI
AND
THE

BEFORE
THE
ARK
OF
THE

UNTIL
THE

AND
THE
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
AND
PUT
DUST
UPON

AND
JOSHUA
SAID
ALAS
O

GOD
WHEREFORE
HAST
THOU
AT
ALL
BROUGHT
THIS
PEOPLE
OVER
JORDAN
TO
DELIVER
US
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
THE
AMORITES
TO

WOULD
TO

DWELT
ON
THE

BEFORE
THEIR
ENEMIES
FOR
THE
CANAANITES
AND
ALL
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
LAND
SHALL
HEAR
OF
IT
AND
SHALL
ENVIRON
US
ROUND
AND
CUT
OFF
OUR

ISRAEL
HATH
SINNED

ACCURSED
THING
AND
HAVE
ALSO
STOLEN
AND
DISSEMBLED
ALSO
AND
THEY
HAVE
PUT
IT
EVEN
AMONG
THEIR

THEREFORE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
COULD
NOT
STAND
BEFORE
THEIR
ENEMIES
BUT
TURNED
THEIR
BACKS
BEFORE
THEIR
ENEMIES
BECAUSE
THEY

TAKETH
SHALL
COME
ACCORDING
TO
THE
FAMILIES
THEREOF
AND
THE
FAMILY
WHICH

SHALL
TAKE
SHALL
COME
BY
HOUSEHOLDS
AND
THE

HE
AND
ALL

BECAUSE
HE
HATH
TRANSGRESSED
THE
COVENANT
OF
THE
LORD
AND
BECAUSE
HE
HATH
WROUGHT
FOLLY
IN
ISRAEL
SO
JOSHUA
ROSE
UP
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
AND
BROUGHT
ISRAEL
BY
THEIR
TRIBES
AND
THE
TRIBE
OF
JUDAH
WAS
TAKEN
AND
HE
BROUGHT
THE
FAMILY
OF

AND
HE
TOOK
THE
FAMILY
OF
THE

AND
HE
BROUGHT
THE
FAMILY
OF
THE

MAN

AND
ZABDI
WAS
TAKEN
AND
HE
BROUGHT
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
MAN

AND
ACHAN
THE
SON
OF
CARMI
THE
SON
OF
ZABDI
THE
SON
OF
ZERAH
OF
THE
TRIBE
OF
JUDAH
WAS
TAKEN
AND
JOSHUA
SAID
UNTO
ACHAN
MY

GIVE
I
PRAY
THEE
GLORY
TO
THE
LORD
GOD
OF

AND
MAKE
CONFESSION
UNTO

ANSWERED
JOSHUA
AND
SAID
INDEED
I
HAVE
SINNED
AGAINST
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
AND
THUS

HAVE
I
DONE
WHEN
I
SAW
AMONG
THE
SPOILS
A
GOODLY
BABYLONISH
GARMENT
AND
TWO
HUNDRED
SHEKELS
OF
SILVER
AND
A
WEDGE
OF
GOLD
OF
FIFTY
SHEKELS
WEIGHT
THEN
I
COVETED
THEM
AND
TOOK
THEM
AND
BEHOLD
THEY
ARE
HID
IN
THE
EARTH
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
MY
TENT
AND
THE
SILVER
UNDER
IT
SO
JOSHUA
SENT
MESSENGERS
AND
THEY
RAN
UNTO
THE
TENT
AND
BEHOLD
IT
WAS
HID
IN
HIS
TENT
AND
THE
SILVER
UNDER

AND
THEY
TOOK
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
TENT
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
UNTO
JOSHUA
AND
UNTO
ALL

AND
HIS
DAUGHTERS
AND
HIS
OXEN
AND
HIS
ASSES
AND
HIS
SHEEP
AND
HIS
TENT
AND
ALL
THAT
HE
HAD
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
THEM
UNTO
THE
VALLEY
OF
ACHOR
AND
JOSHUA
SAID
WHY

THOU
TROUBLED
US
THE
LORD
SHALL
TROUBLE
THEE
THIS
DAY
AND
ALL
ISRAEL
STONED
HIM
WITH

AFTER

HAD
STONED
THEM
WITH
STONES
AND
THEY
RAISED
OVER
HIM
A
GREAT
HEAP
OF
STONES
UNTO
THIS
DAY
SO
THE
LORD
TURNED
FROM
THE
FIERCENESS
OF
HIS
ANGER
WHEREFORE
THE
NAME
OF
THAT
PLACE
WAS
CALLED
THE
VALLEY
OF

THEREOF
SHALL

TAKE
FOR
A
PREY
UNTO
YOURSELVES
LAY
THEE
AN
AMBUSH
FOR
THE
CITY
BEHIND

SO
JOSHUA
AROSE
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
OF
WAR
TO
GO
UP
AGAINST
AI
AND
JOSHUA
CHOSE
OUT
THIRTY
THOUSAND
MIGHTY
MEN
OF
VALOUR
AND
SENT
THEM
AWAY
BY
NIGHT
AND
HE
COMMANDED
THEM
SAYING
BEHOLD

EVEN
BEHIND
THE

AND
I
AND
ALL

WILL
APPROACH
UNTO
THE

AND
IT
SHALL
COME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THEY
COME
OUT
AGAINST
US
AS
AT

FIRST
THAT
WE
WILL
FLEE
BEFORE

FOR
THEY
WILL
COME
OUT
AFTER

THEM
FROM
THE
CITY
FOR
THEY
WILL
SAY
THEY
FLEE
BEFORE

AS
AT
THE
FIRST
THEREFORE
WE
WILL
FLEE
BEFORE

THEN
YE
SHALL
RISE
UP
FROM
THE
AMBUSH
AND
SEIZE
UPON
THE
CITY
FOR
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
WILL
DELIVER
IT
INTO
YOUR

AND
IT
SHALL
BE
WHEN
YE
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
CITY
THAT
YE
SHALL
SET
THE
CITY
ON
FIRE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
THE
LORD
SHALL
YE
DO
SEE
I
HAVE
COMMANDED
YOU
JOSHUA
THEREFORE
SENT
THEM
FORTH
AND
THEY
WENT
TO
LIE
IN
AMBUSH
AND
ABODE
BETWEEN
BETHEL
AND
AI
ON
THE
WEST
SIDE
OF
AI
BUT
JOSHUA
LODGED
THAT
NIGHT
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
AND
JOSHUA
ROSE
UP
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
AND
NUMBERED
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WENT
UP
HE
AND
THE
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
BEFORE
THE
PEOPLE
TO
AI
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
EVEN
THE
PEOPLE
OF
WAR
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
WENT
UP
AND
DREW
NIGH
AND
CAME
BEFORE
THE
CITY
AND
PITCHED
ON
THE
NORTH
SIDE
OF
AI
NOW
THERE
WAS
A
VALLEY
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
AI
AND
HE
TOOK
ABOUT
FIVE
THOUSAND
MEN
AND
SET
THEM
TO
LIE
IN
AMBUSH
BETWEEN
BETHEL
AND
AI
ON
THE
WEST
SIDE
OF
THE
CITY
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SET
THE
PEOPLE
EVEN
ALL
THE
HOST
THAT
WAS
ON
THE
NORTH
OF
THE
CITY
AND
THEIR
LIERS
IN
WAIT
ON
THE
WEST
OF
THE
CITY
JOSHUA
WENT
THAT
NIGHT
INTO
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
VALLEY
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
KING
OF
AI
SAW
IT
THAT
THEY
HASTED
AND
ROSE
UP
EARLY
AND
THE
MEN
OF
THE
CITY
WENT
OUT
AGAINST
ISRAEL
TO
BATTLE
HE
AND
ALL
HIS
PEOPLE
AT
A
TIME
APPOINTED
BEFORE
THE
PLAIN
BUT
HE
WIST
NOT
THAT
THERE
WERE
LIERS
IN
AMBUSH
AGAINST
HIM
BEHIND
THE
CITY
AND
JOSHUA
AND
ALL
ISRAEL
MADE
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
BEATEN
BEFORE
THEM
AND
FLED
BY
THE
WAY
OF
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
IN
AI
WERE
CALLED
TOGETHER
TO
PURSUE
AFTER
THEM
AND
THEY
PURSUED
AFTER
JOSHUA
AND
WERE
DRAWN
AWAY
FROM
THE
CITY
AND
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
MAN
LEFT
IN
AI
OR
BETHEL
THAT
WENT
NOT
OUT
AFTER
ISRAEL
AND
THEY
LEFT
THE
CITY
OPEN
AND
PURSUED
AFTER
ISRAEL
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
JOSHUA
STRETCH
OUT
THE
SPEAR
THAT
IS
IN
THY
HAND
TOWARD
AI
FOR
I
WILL
GIVE
IT
INTO
THINE
HAND
AND
JOSHUA
STRETCHED
OUT
THE
SPEAR
THAT
HE
HAD
IN
HIS
HAND
TOWARD
THE
CITY
AND
THE
AMBUSH
AROSE
QUICKLY
OUT
OF
THEIR
PLACE
AND
THEY
RAN
AS
SOON
AS
HE
HAD
STRETCHED
OUT
HIS
HAND
AND
THEY
ENTERED
INTO
THE
CITY
AND
TOOK
IT
AND
HASTED
AND
SET
THE
CITY
ON
FIRE
AND
WHEN
THE
MEN
OF
AI
LOOKED
BEHIND
THEM
THEY
SAW
AND
BEHOLD
THE
SMOKE
OF
THE
CITY
ASCENDED
UP
TO
HEAVEN
AND
THEY
HAD
NO
POWER
TO
FLEE
THIS
WAY
OR
THAT
WAY
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
FLED
TO
THE
WILDERNESS
TURNED
BACK
UPON
THE
PURSUERS
AND
WHEN
JOSHUA
AND
ALL
ISRAEL
SAW
THAT
THE
AMBUSH
HAD
TAKEN
THE
CITY
AND
THAT
THE
SMOKE
OF
THE
CITY
ASCENDED
THEN
THEY
TURNED
AGAIN
AND
SLEW
THE
MEN
OF
AI
AND
THE
OTHER
ISSUED
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AGAINST
THEM
SO
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
ISRAEL
SOME
ON
THIS
SIDE
AND
SOME
ON
THAT
SIDE
AND
THEY
SMOTE
THEM
SO
THAT
THEY
LET
NONE
OF
THEM
REMAIN
OR
ESCAPE
AND
THE
KING
OF
AI
THEY
TOOK
ALIVE
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
JOSHUA
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
ISRAEL
HAD
MADE
AN
END
OF
SLAYING
ALL
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
AI
IN
THE
FIELD
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
WHEREIN
THEY
CHASED
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ALL
FALLEN
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
SWORD
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
CONSUMED
THAT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
RETURNED
UNTO
AI
AND
SMOTE
IT
WITH
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
SWORD
AND
SO
IT
WAS
THAT
ALL
THAT
FELL
THAT
DAY
BOTH
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WERE
TWELVE
THOUSAND
EVEN
ALL
THE
MEN
OF
AI
FOR
JOSHUA
DREW
NOT
HIS
HAND
BACK
WHEREWITH
HE
STRETCHED
OUT
THE
SPEAR
UNTIL
HE
HAD
UTTERLY
DESTROYED
ALL
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
AI
ONLY
THE
CATTLE
AND
THE
SPOIL
OF
THAT
CITY
ISRAEL
TOOK
FOR
A
PREY
UNTO
THEMSELVES
ACCORDING
UNTO
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
WHICH
HE
COMMANDED
JOSHUA
AND
JOSHUA
BURNT
AI
AND
MADE
IT
AN
HEAP
FOR
EVER
EVEN
A
DESOLATION
UNTO
THIS
DAY
AND
THE
KING
OF
AI
HE
HANGED
ON
A
TREE
UNTIL
EVENTIDE
AND
AS
SOON
AS
THE
SUN
WAS
DOWN
JOSHUA
COMMANDED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
TAKE
HIS
CARCASE
DOWN
FROM
THE
TREE
AND
CAST
IT
AT
THE
ENTERING
OF
THE
GATE
OF
THE
CITY
AND
RAISE
THEREON
A
GREAT
HEAP
OF
STONES
THAT
REMAINETH
UNTO
THIS
DAY
THEN
JOSHUA
BUILT
AN
ALTAR
UNTO
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
IN
MOUNT
EBAL
AS
MOSES
THE
SERVANT
OF
THE
LORD
COMMANDED
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
AN
ALTAR
OF
WHOLE
STONES
OVER
WHICH
NO
MAN
HATH
LIFT
UP
ANY
IRON
AND
THEY
OFFERED
THEREON
BURNT
OFFERINGS
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
SACRIFICED
PEACE
OFFERINGS
AND
HE
WROTE
THERE
UPON
THE
STONES
A
COPY
OF
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
WHICH
HE
WROTE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
ALL
ISRAEL
AND
THEIR
ELDERS
AND
OFFICERS
AND
THEIR
JUDGES
STOOD
ON
THIS
SIDE
THE

AND
ON
THAT
SIDE
BEFORE
THE
PRIESTS
THE
LEVITES
WHICH
BARE
THE
ARK
OF
THE
COVENANT
OF
THE
LORD
AS
WELL
THE
STRANGER
AS
HE
THAT
WAS
BORN
AMONG
THEM
HALF
OF
THEM
OVER
AGAINST
MOUNT
GERIZIM
AND
HALF
OF
THEM
OVER
AGAINST
MOUNT
EBAL
AS
MOSES
THE
SERVANT
OF
THE
LORD
HAD
COMMANDED
BEFORE
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BLESS
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
AND
AFTERWARD
HE
READ
ALL
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
LAW
THE
BLESSINGS
AND
CURSINGS
ACCORDING
TO
ALL
THAT
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
LAW
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
WORD
OF
ALL
THAT
MOSES
COMMANDED
WHICH
JOSHUA
READ
NOT
BEFORE
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
OF
ISRAEL
WITH
THE
WOMEN
AND
THE
LITTLE
ONES
AND
THE
STRANGERS
THAT
WERE
CONVERSANT
AMONG
THEM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
ALL
THE
KINGS
WHICH
WERE
ON
THIS
SIDE
JORDAN
IN
THE
HILLS
AND
IN
THE
VALLEYS
AND
IN
ALL
THE

THE

HEARD
THEREOF
THAT
THEY
GATHERED
THEMSELVES
TOGETHER
TO
FIGHT
WITH
JOSHUA
AND
WITH
ISRAEL
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
AND
WHEN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
GIBEON
HEARD
WHAT
JOSHUA
HAD
DONE
UNTO
JERICHO
AND
TO
AI
THEY
DID
WORK
WILILY
AND
WENT

THEY
HAD
BEEN
AMBASSADORS
AND
TOOK
OLD

BOTTLES

UNTO
THE
CAMP
AT

AND
JOSHUA
SAID
UNTO

AND
FROM
WHENCE

AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
FROM
A
VERY
FAR
COUNTRY
THY
SERVANTS
ARE
COME
BECAUSE
OF
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
THY

WERE
BEYOND
JORDAN
TO
SIHON
KING
OF
HESHBON

OG
KING
OF

AND
BEHOLD
THEY
BE
RENT
AND
THESE
OUR
GARMENTS
AND
OUR

ARE
BECOME
OLD
BY
REASON
OF
THE
VERY
LONG
JOURNEY
AND
THE
MEN
TOOK
OF
THEIR
VICTUALS
AND
ASKED
NOT
COUNSEL
AT
THE
MOUTH
OF
THE

AND
JOSHUA
MADE
PEACE
WITH

AND
MADE
A
LEAGUE
WITH
THEM
TO
LET
THEM
LIVE
AND
THE
PRINCES
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
SWARE
UNTO

AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THE
END
OF
THREE
DAYS
AFTER
THEY
HAD
MADE
A
LEAGUE
WITH

THAT
THEY
HEARD
THAT
THEY

NOT
BECAUSE
THE
PRINCES
OF

HAD
SWORN
UNTO

BY
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
AND
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
MURMURED
AGAINST
THE
PRINCES
BUT
ALL
THE
PRINCES
SAID
UNTO
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
WE
HAVE
SWORN
UNTO
THEM
BY
THE

GOD
OF

NOW
THEREFORE
WE

THIS
WE

WE
WILL
EVEN
LET

LIVE
LEST
WRATH
BE
UPON
US
BECAUSE
OF
THE
OATH
WHICH
WE

BUT
LET
THEM
BE
HEWERS
OF
WOOD
AND
DRAWERS
OF
WATER
UNTO
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
AS
THE

BE
FREED
FROM
BEING
BONDMEN
AND
HEWERS
OF
WOOD
AND
DRAWERS
OF
WATER
FOR
THE
HOUSE
OF
MY
GOD
AND
THEY
ANSWERED
JOSHUA
AND
SAID
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
TOLD
THY
SERVANTS
HOW
THAT
THE
LORD
THY
GOD
COMMANDED
HIS

MOSES
TO
GIVE

CRIED
UNTO
THE

HE
PUT
DARKNESS
BETWEEN

AND
BROUGHT
THE
SEA
UPON

HAVE
SEEN
WHAT

HAVE
DONE
IN

AND
YE
DWELT
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
A
LONG
SEASON
AND
I
BROUGHT
YOU
INTO
THE
LAND
OF
THE
AMORITES
WHICH
DWELT
ON
THE
OTHER

JORDAN
AND
THEY
FOUGHT
WITH
YOU
AND
I
GAVE
THEM
INTO
YOUR

THAT
YE
MIGHT
POSSESS
THEIR

AND
I
DESTROYED

BALAK
THE

AROSE

SENT
AND
CALLED
BALAAM
THE

YOU
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
HEARKEN
UNTO

THEREFORE
HE
BLESSED
YOU
STILL
SO

THE
PERIZZITES
AND
THE
CANAANITES
AND
THE
HITTITES
AND
THE
GIRGASHITES
THE
HIVITES
AND
THE
JEBUSITES
AND
I
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
YOUR

AND
I
SENT
THE
HORNET
BEFORE

WHICH
DRAVE
THEM
OUT
FROM

YOU
EVEN
THE
TWO
KINGS

CONSUME
YOU
AFTER
THAT

HATH
DONE
YOU
GOOD
AND
THE

CHOSEN
YOU
THE

GOD
OF

THAT
WERE
ROUND
ABOUT

TO
ANGER
AND
THEY
FORSOOK
THE

AND
SERVED
BAAL
AND
ASHTAROTH
AND
THE
ANGER
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
HOT
AGAINST
ISRAEL
AND
HE
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
SPOILERS
THAT
SPOILED
THEM
AND
HE
SOLD
THEM
INTO
THE

OF
THEIR
ENEMIES
ROUND
ABOUT
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
ANY
LONGER
STAND
BEFORE
THEIR

WHITHERSOEVER
THEY
WENT
OUT
THE
HAND
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
AGAINST
THEM
FOR
EVIL
AS
THE
LORD
HAD
SAID
AND
AS
THE
LORD
HAD
SWORN
UNTO
THEM
AND
THEY
WERE
GREATLY
DISTRESSED
NEVERTHELESS
THE
LORD
RAISED
UP
JUDGES
WHICH
DELIVERED
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF
THOSE
THAT
SPOILED
THEM
AND
YET
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HEARKEN
UNTO
THEIR

BUT
THEY
WENT
A
WHORING
AFTER
OTHER
GODS
AND
BOWED
THEMSELVES
UNTO
THEM
THEY
TURNED
QUICKLY
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
WHICH
THEIR
FATHERS
WALKED
IN
OBEYING
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
THE
LORD
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
SO
AND
WHEN
THE

RAISED
THEM
UP
JUDGES
THEN
THE
LORD
WAS
WITH
THE
JUDGE
AND
DELIVERED
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF
THEIR

ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
THE

FOR
IT
REPENTED
THE
LORD
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
GROANINGS
BY
REASON
OF
THEM
THAT
OPPRESSED
THEM
AND
VEXED
THEM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
JUDGE
WAS
DEAD
THAT
THEY
RETURNED
AND
CORRUPTED
THEMSELVES
MORE
THAN
THEIR
FATHERS
IN
FOLLOWING
OTHER
GODS
TO
SERVE
THEM
AND
TO
BOW
DOWN
UNTO
THEM
THEY
CEASED
NOT
FROM
THEIR
OWN
DOINGS
NOR
FROM
THEIR
STUBBORN
WAY
AND
THE
ANGER
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
HOT
AGAINST
ISRAEL
AND
HE
SAID
BECAUSE
THAT
THIS
PEOPLE
HATH
TRANSGRESSED
MY
COVENANT

WILL
NOT
HENCEFORTH
DRIVE
OUT
ANY
FROM

OF
THE

WHICH
JOSHUA
LEFT
WHEN

I
MAY
PROVE
ISRAEL
WHETHER
THEY
WILL
KEEP
THE
WAY
OF
THE
LORD
TO
WALK
THEREIN
AS
THEIR

DID
KEEP
IT
OR

THEREFORE
THE
LORD
LEFT
THOSE
NATIONS
WITHOUT
DRIVING
THEM
OUT
HASTILY
NEITHER
DELIVERED
HE
THEM
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
JOSHUA
NOW
THESE
ARE
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
THE

TO
PROVE
ISRAEL
BY

EVEN
AS
MANY
OF

THE

SO
THE

BUT
WHEN
THE

THE

UP
A

EHUD
THE

A
MAN
LEFTHANDED
AND
BY
HIM
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
SENT
A
PRESENT
UNTO
EGLON
THE
KING
OF
MOAB
BUT
EHUD
MADE
HIM
A
DAGGER
WHICH
HAD
TWO
EDGES
OF
A
CUBIT
LENGTH
AND
HE
DID
GIRD
IT
UNDER
HIS
RAIMENT
UPON
HIS
RIGHT
THIGH
AND
HE
BROUGHT
THE
PRESENT
UNTO
EGLON
KING
OF
MOAB
AND
EGLON
WAS
A
VERY
FAT
MAN
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
MADE
AN
END
TO
OFFER
THE
PRESENT
HE
SENT
AWAY
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
BARE
THE
PRESENT
BUT
HE
HIMSELF
TURNED
AGAIN
FROM
THE
QUARRIES
THAT
WERE
BY
GILGAL
AND
SAID
I
HAVE
A
SECRET
ERRAND
UNTO
THEE
O
KING
WHO
SAID
KEEP
SILENCE
AND
ALL
THAT
STOOD
BY
HIM
WENT
OUT
FROM
HIM
AND
EHUD
CAME
UNTO
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
SITTING
IN
A
SUMMER
PARLOUR
WHICH
HE
HAD
FOR
HIMSELF
ALONE
AND
EHUD
SAID
I
HAVE
A
MESSAGE
FROM
GOD
UNTO
THEE
AND
HE
AROSE
OUT
OF
HIS
SEAT
AND
EHUD
PUT
FORTH
HIS
LEFT
HAND
AND
TOOK
THE
DAGGER
FROM
HIS
RIGHT
THIGH
AND
THRUST
IT
INTO
HIS
BELLY
AND
THE
HAFT
ALSO
WENT
IN
AFTER
THE
BLADE
AND
THE
FAT
CLOSED
UPON
THE
BLADE
SO
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
DRAW
THE
DAGGER
OUT
OF
HIS
BELLY
AND
THE
DIRT
CAME
OUT
THEN
EHUD
WENT
FORTH
THROUGH
THE
PORCH
AND
SHUT
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
PARLOUR
UPON
HIM
AND
LOCKED
THEM
WHEN
HE
WAS
GONE
OUT
HIS
SERVANTS
CAME
AND
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THAT
BEHOLD
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
PARLOUR
WERE

THEY
SAID
SURELY
HE
COVERETH
HIS
FEET
IN

CHAMBER
AND
THEY
TARRIED
TILL
THEY
WERE
ASHAMED
AND
BEHOLD
HE
OPENED
NOT
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
PARLOUR
THEREFORE
THEY
TOOK
A
KEY
AND
OPENED
THEM
AND
BEHOLD
THEIR
LORD
WAS
FALLEN
DOWN
DEAD
ON
THE
EARTH
AND
EHUD
ESCAPED
WHILE

PASSED
BEYOND
THE

AND
ESCAPED
UNTO
SEIRATH
AND
IT
CAME
TO

HATH
DELIVERED
YOUR

AND
THEY
WENT
DOWN
AFTER

AND
TOOK
THE

AND
SUFFERED
NOT
A
MAN

TIME
ABOUT
TEN

AND
CONSUMED
THE

AND
THE
UNLEAVENED
CAKES
THEN
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE

DEPARTED
OUT
OF

AND
WHEN

MAKETH
POOR
AND
MAKETH
RICH
HE
BRINGETH
LOW
AND
LIFTETH
UP
HE
RAISETH
UP
THE
POOR
OUT
OF
THE
DUST
AND
LIFTETH
UP
THE
BEGGAR
FROM
THE
DUNGHILL
TO
SET
THEM
AMONG
PRINCES
AND
TO
MAKE
THEM
INHERIT
THE
THRONE
OF
GLORY
FOR
THE
PILLARS
OF
THE
EARTH
ARE
THE
LORD'S
AND
HE
HATH
SET
THE
WORLD
UPON
THEM
HE
WILL
KEEP
THE
FEET
OF
HIS
SAINTS
AND
THE
WICKED
SHALL
BE
SILENT
IN
DARKNESS
FOR
BY
STRENGTH
SHALL
NO
MAN
PREVAIL
THE
ADVERSARIES
OF
THE

SHALL
BE
BROKEN
TO
PIECES
OUT
OF

SHALL
HE
THUNDER
UPON
THEM
THE
LORD
SHALL
JUDGE
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
HE
SHALL
GIVE
STRENGTH
UNTO
HIS
KING
AND
EXALT
THE
HORN
OF
HIS
ANOINTED
AND
ELKANAH
WENT
TO
RAMAH
TO
HIS
HOUSE
AND
THE
CHILD
DID
MINISTER
UNTO
THE
LORD
BEFORE
ELI
THE
PRIEST
NOW
THE
SONS
OF
ELI
WERE
SONS
OF
BELIAL
THEY
KNEW
NOT
THE
LORD
AND
THE
PRIEST'S
CUSTOM
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
WAS
THAT
WHEN
ANY
MAN
OFFERED
SACRIFICE
THE
PRIEST'S
SERVANT
CAME
WHILE
THE
FLESH
WAS
IN
SEETHING
WITH
A
FLESHHOOK
OF
THREE
TEETH
IN
HIS
HAND
AND
HE
STRUCK
IT
INTO
THE
PAN
OR
KETTLE
OR
CALDRON
OR
POT
ALL
THAT
THE
FLESHHOOK
BROUGHT
UP
THE
PRIEST
TOOK
FOR
HIMSELF
SO
THEY
DID
IN
SHILOH
UNTO
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
THAT
CAME
THITHER
ALSO
BEFORE
THEY
BURNT
THE
FAT
THE
PRIEST'S
SERVANT
CAME
AND
SAID
TO
THE
MAN
THAT
SACRIFICED
GIVE
FLESH
TO
ROAST
FOR
THE
PRIEST
FOR
HE
WILL
NOT
HAVE
SODDEN
FLESH
OF
THEE
BUT
RAW
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
SAID
UNTO
HIM
LET
THEM
NOT
FAIL
TO
BURN
THE
FAT
PRESENTLY
AND
THEN
TAKE
AS
MUCH
AS
THY
SOUL
DESIRETH
THEN
HE
WOULD
ANSWER
HIM
NAY
BUT
THOU
SHALT
GIVE
IT
ME
NOW
AND
IF
NOT
I
WILL
TAKE
IT
BY
FORCE
WHEREFORE
THE
SIN
OF
THE
YOUNG
MEN
WAS
VERY
GREAT
BEFORE
THE
LORD
FOR
MEN
ABHORRED
THE
OFFERING
OF
THE
LORD
BUT
SAMUEL
MINISTERED
BEFORE
THE
LORD
BEING
A
CHILD
GIRDED
WITH
A
LINEN
EPHOD
MOREOVER
HIS
MOTHER
MADE
HIM
A
LITTLE
COAT
AND
BROUGHT
IT
TO
HIM
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
WHEN
SHE
CAME
UP
WITH
HER
HUSBAND
TO
OFFER
THE
YEARLY
SACRIFICE
AND
ELI
BLESSED
ELKANAH
AND
HIS
WIFE
AND
SAID
THE
LORD
GIVE
THEE
SEED
OF
THIS
WOMAN
FOR
THE
LOAN
WHICH
IS
LENT
TO
THE
LORD
AND
THEY
WENT
UNTO
THEIR
OWN
HOME
AND
THE
LORD
VISITED
HANNAH
SO
THAT
SHE
CONCEIVED
AND
BARE
THREE
SONS
AND
TWO
DAUGHTERS
AND
THE
CHILD
SAMUEL
GREW
BEFORE
THE
LORD
NOW
ELI
WAS
VERY
OLD
AND
HEARD
ALL
THAT
HIS
SONS
DID
UNTO
ALL
ISRAEL
AND
HOW
THEY
LAY
WITH
THE
WOMEN
THAT
ASSEMBLED
AT
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
TABERNACLE
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
DO
YE
SUCH
THINGS
FOR
I
HEAR
OF
YOUR
EVIL
DEALINGS
BY
ALL
THIS
PEOPLE
NAY
MY
SONS
FOR
IT
IS
NO
GOOD
REPORT
THAT
I
HEAR
YE
MAKE
THE
LORD'S
PEOPLE
TO
TRANSGRESS
IF
ONE
MAN
SIN
AGAINST
ANOTHER
THE
JUDGE
SHALL
JUDGE
HIM
BUT
IF
A
MAN
SIN
AGAINST
THE
LORD
WHO
SHALL
INTREAT
FOR
HIM
NOTWITHSTANDING
THEY
HEARKENED
NOT
UNTO
THE
VOICE
OF
THEIR
FATHER
BECAUSE
THE
LORD
WOULD
SLAY
THEM
AND
THE
CHILD
SAMUEL
GREW
ON
AND
WAS
IN
FAVOUR
BOTH
WITH
THE
LORD
AND
ALSO
WITH
MEN
AND
THERE
CAME
A
MAN
OF
GOD
UNTO
ELI
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THUS
SAITH
THE
LORD
DID
I
PLAINLY
APPEAR
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THY
FATHER
WHEN
THEY
WERE
IN
EGYPT
IN
PHARAOH'S
HOUSE
AND
DID
I
CHOOSE
HIM
OUT
OF
ALL
THE
TRIBES
OF
ISRAEL
TO
BE
MY
PRIEST
TO
OFFER
UPON
MINE
ALTAR
TO
BURN
INCENSE
TO
WEAR
AN
EPHOD
BEFORE
ME
AND
DID
I
GIVE
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THY
FATHER
ALL
THE
OFFERINGS
MADE
BY
FIRE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
WHEREFORE
KICK
YE
AT
MY
SACRIFICE
AND
AT
MINE
OFFERING
WHICH
I
HAVE
COMMANDED
IN
MY
HABITATION
AND
HONOUREST
THY
SONS
ABOVE
ME
TO
MAKE
YOURSELVES
FAT
WITH
THE
CHIEFEST
OF
ALL
THE
OFFERINGS
OF
ISRAEL
MY
PEOPLE
WHEREFORE
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
SAITH
I
SAID
INDEED
THAT
THY
HOUSE
AND
THE
HOUSE
OF
THY
FATHER
SHOULD
WALK
BEFORE
ME
FOR
EVER
BUT
NOW
THE
LORD
SAITH
BE
IT
FAR
FROM
ME
FOR
THEM
THAT
HONOUR
ME
I
WILL
HONOUR
AND
THEY
THAT
DESPISE
ME
SHALL
BE
LIGHTLY
ESTEEMED
BEHOLD
THE
DAYS
COME
THAT
I
WILL
CUT
OFF
THINE
ARM
AND
THE
ARM
OF
THY
FATHER'S
HOUSE
THAT
THERE
SHALL
NOT
BE
AN
OLD
MAN
IN
THINE
HOUSE
AND
THOU
SHALT
SEE
AN
ENEMY
IN
MY
HABITATION
IN
ALL
THE
WEALTH
WHICH
GOD
SHALL
GIVE
ISRAEL
AND
THERE
SHALL
NOT
BE
AN
OLD
MAN
IN
THINE
HOUSE
FOR
EVER
AND
THE
MAN
OF
THINE
WHOM
I
SHALL
NOT
CUT
OFF
FROM
MINE
ALTAR
SHALL
BE
TO
CONSUME
THINE
EYES
AND
TO
GRIEVE
THINE
HEART
AND
ALL
THE
INCREASE
OF
THINE
HOUSE
SHALL
DIE
IN
THE
FLOWER
OF
THEIR
AGE
AND
THIS
SHALL
BE
A
SIGN
UNTO
THEE
THAT
SHALL
COME
UPON
THY
TWO
SONS
ON
HOPHNI
AND
PHINEHAS
IN
ONE
DAY
THEY
SHALL
DIE
BOTH
OF
THEM
AND
I
WILL
RAISE
ME
UP
A
FAITHFUL
PRIEST
THAT
SHALL
DO
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
WHICH
IS
IN
MINE
HEART
AND
IN
MY
MIND
AND
I
WILL
BUILD
HIM
A
SURE
HOUSE
AND
HE
SHALL
WALK
BEFORE
MINE
ANOINTED
FOR
EVER
AND
IT
SHALL
COME
TO
PASS
THAT
EVERY
ONE
THAT
IS
LEFT
IN
THINE
HOUSE
SHALL
COME
AND
CROUCH
TO
HIM
FOR
A
PIECE
OF
SILVER
AND
A
MORSEL
OF
BREAD
AND
SHALL
SAY
PUT
ME
I
PRAY
THEE
INTO
ONE
OF
THE
PRIESTS'
OFFICES
THAT
I
MAY
EAT
A
PIECE
OF
BREAD
AND
THE
CHILD
SAMUEL
MINISTERED
UNTO
THE
LORD
BEFORE
ELI
AND
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
PRECIOUS
IN
THOSE
DAYS
THERE
WAS
NO
OPEN
VISION
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THAT
TIME
WHEN
ELI
WAS
LAID
DOWN
IN
HIS
PLACE
AND
HIS
EYES
BEGAN
TO
WAX
DIM
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
SEE
AND
ERE
THE
LAMP
OF
GOD
WENT
OUT
IN
THE
TEMPLE
OF
THE
LORD
WHERE
THE
ARK
OF
GOD
WAS
AND
SAMUEL
WAS
LAID
DOWN
TO
SLEEP
THAT
THE
LORD
CALLED
SAMUEL
AND
HE
ANSWERED
HERE
AM
I
AND
HE
RAN
UNTO
ELI
AND
SAID
HERE
AM
I
FOR
THOU
CALLEDST
ME
AND
HE
SAID
I
CALLED
NOT
LIE
DOWN
AGAIN
AND
HE
WENT
AND
LAY
DOWN
AND
THE
LORD
CALLED
YET
AGAIN
SAMUEL
AND
SAMUEL
AROSE
AND
WENT
TO
ELI
AND
SAID
HERE
AM
I
FOR
THOU
DIDST
CALL
ME
AND
HE
ANSWERED
I
CALLED
NOT
MY
SON
LIE
DOWN
AGAIN
NOW
SAMUEL
DID
NOT
YET
KNOW
THE
LORD
NEITHER
WAS
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
YET
REVEALED
UNTO
HIM
AND
THE
LORD
CALLED
SAMUEL
AGAIN
THE
THIRD
TIME
AND
HE
AROSE
AND
WENT
TO
ELI
AND
SAID
HERE
AM
I
FOR
THOU
DIDST
CALL
ME
AND
ELI
PERCEIVED
THAT
THE
LORD
HAD
CALLED
THE
CHILD
THEREFORE
ELI
SAID
UNTO
SAMUEL
GO
LIE
DOWN
AND
IT
SHALL
BE
IF
HE
CALL
THEE
THAT
THOU
SHALT
SAY
SPEAK
LORD
FOR
THY
SERVANT
HEARETH
SO

WENT
AND
LAY
DOWN
IN

STOOD
AND
CALLED
AS

TIMES
SAMUEL

I
HAVE
SPOKEN
CONCERNING
HIS

WHEN

FOR

HAVE
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
WILL
JUDGE
HIS

FOR
THE
INIQUITY
WHICH
HE
KNOWETH
BECAUSE
HIS
SONS
MADE
THEMSELVES
VILE
AND
HE
RESTRAINED
THEM
NOT
AND
THEREFORE
I
HAVE
SWORN
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
ELI
THAT
THE
INIQUITY
OF
ELI'S
HOUSE
SHALL
NOT
BE
PURGED
WITH
SACRIFICE

NOTHING
FROM

HE
SAID

WAS
WITH

THEREFORE
THEY

SAYING
THEY
HAVE
BROUGHT
ABOUT
THE

WITH
THE

AND
THE

WENT
UP

DO
TO
THE

PERADVENTURE
HE
WILL
LIGHTEN
HIS

FROM
OFF
YOU
AND
FROM
OFF
YOUR

WHEREFORE
THEN
DO

AND
PHARAOH
HARDENED
THEIR
HEARTS
WHEN
HE
HAD
WROUGHT
WONDERFULLY
AMONG

DID
THEY
NOT

BUT
IF
NOT
THEN
WE
SHALL
KNOW
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
HIS

THAT
SMOTE

IT
WAS
A

IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN

MADE
HIS

NOW
THE

THEY

THEN
ALL

CHARIOTS
AND
SIX

HORSEMEN
AND

SHORE
IN

AND
THEY
CAME
UP

PITCHED
IN

EASTWARD
FROM
BETHAVEN
WHEN
THE
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
SAW
THAT
THEY
WERE
IN
A
STRAIT
FOR
THE

WERE
DISTRESSED
THEN
THE

DID
HIDE
THEMSELVES
IN
CAVES
AND
IN
THICKETS
AND
IN
ROCKS
AND
IN
HIGH
PLACES
AND
IN

AND
SOME

AND
GILEAD
AS
FOR
SAUL
HE
WAS

AND
ALL

FOLLOWED

TREMBLING
AND
HE
TARRIED
SEVEN
DAYS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SET
TIME
THAT
SAMUEL
HAD
APPOINTED
BUT
SAMUEL
CAME
NOT
TO
GILGAL
AND
THE

WERE
SCATTERED
FROM

AND
SAUL
SAID
BRING

OFFERING
AND

THAT
AS

THE

OFFERING
BEHOLD
SAMUEL
CAME
AND
SAUL
WENT
OUT
TO
MEET
HIM
THAT
HE
MIGHT
SALUTE
HIM
AND
SAMUEL
SAID
WHAT
HAST
THOU
DONE
AND
SAUL
SAID
BECAUSE
I

AND
THAT
THOU
CAMEST
NOT
WITHIN
THE

APPOINTED
AND
THAT
THE

THEREFORE
SAID

AND
I
HAVE

FOOLISHLY
THOU

THE

HATH
SOUGHT
HIM
A
MAN
AFTER
HIS

AND
THE

HATH

AND
SAUL
AND
JONATHAN
HIS

AND
THE

THAT
WERE
PRESENT
WITH

ABODE
IN
GIBEAH
OF

BUT
THE
PHILISTINES
ENCAMPED
IN
MICHMASH
AND
THE
SPOILERS
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
CAMP
OF
THE
PHILISTINES
IN
THREE
COMPANIES
ONE
COMPANY
TURNED
UNTO
THE
WAY
THAT
LEADETH
TO
OPHRAH
UNTO
THE
LAND
OF
SHUAL
AND
ANOTHER
COMPANY
TURNED
THE

TO

AND
ANOTHER
COMPANY
TURNED
TO
THE
WAY
OF
THE
BORDER
THAT
LOOKETH
TO
THE
VALLEY
OF
ZEBOIM
TOWARD
THE
WILDERNESS
NOW
THERE
WAS
NO
SMITH
FOUND
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
THE
PHILISTINES
SAID
LEST
THE
HEBREWS
MAKE
THEM
SWORDS
OR
SPEARS
BUT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
WENT
DOWN
TO
THE
PHILISTINES
TO
SHARPEN
EVERY
MAN
HIS
SHARE
AND
HIS
COULTER
AND
HIS
AXE
AND
HIS
MATTOCK
YET
THEY
HAD
A

MATTOCKS
AND
FOR
THE
COULTERS
AND
FOR
THE
FORKS
AND
FOR
THE
AXES
AND
TO
SHARPEN
THE

SO
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE
DAY
OF
BATTLE
THAT
THERE
WAS
NEITHER
SWORD
NOR
SPEAR
FOUND
IN
THE
HAND
OF
ANY

AND
WITH
JONATHAN
HIS

WAS
THERE
FOUND
AND
THE
GARRISON
OF
THE
PHILISTINES
WENT
OUT
TO
THE
PASSAGE
OF
MICHMASH
NOW
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
UPON
A
DAY
THAT
JONATHAN
THE
SON
OF
SAUL
SAID
UNTO
THE
YOUNG
MAN
THAT
BARE
HIS
ARMOUR
COME
AND
LET
US
GO
OVER
TO
THE
PHILISTINES'
GARRISON
THAT
IS
ON
THE

SIDE
BUT
HE
TOLD
NOT
HIS

AND
SAUL
TARRIED
IN
THE
UTTERMOST
PART
OF
GIBEAH
UNDER
A
POMEGRANATE
TREE
WHICH
IS
IN
MIGRON
AND
THE

THAT
WERE

THE

THE
LORD'S
PRIEST
IN
SHILOH
WEARING
AN
EPHOD
AND
THE
PEOPLE
KNEW
NOT
THAT
JONATHAN
WAS
GONE
AND
BETWEEN
THE
PASSAGES
BY
WHICH
JONATHAN
SOUGHT
TO
GO
OVER
UNTO
THE
PHILISTINES'
GARRISON
THERE
WAS
A
SHARP
ROCK
ON
THE
ONE
SIDE
AND
A
SHARP
ROCK
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AND
THE
NAME
OF
THE
ONE
WAS
BOZEZ
AND
THE

OF
THE

SENEH
THE
FOREFRONT
OF
THE
ONE
WAS
SITUATE
NORTHWARD
OVER
AGAINST
MICHMASH
AND
THE
OTHER
SOUTHWARD
OVER
AGAINST
GIBEAH
AND
JONATHAN
SAID
TO
THE
YOUNG
MAN
THAT
BARE
HIS
ARMOUR
COME
AND
LET
US
GO
OVER
UNTO
THE
GARRISON
OF
THESE
UNCIRCUMCISED
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
LORD
WILL
WORK
FOR
US
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
RESTRAINT
TO
THE
LORD
TO
SAVE
BY
MANY
OR
BY
FEW
AND
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
SAID
UNTO
HIM
DO
ALL
THAT
IS
IN
THINE
HEART
TURN
THEE
BEHOLD
I
AM
WITH
THEE
ACCORDING
TO
THY
HEART
THEN
SAID
JONATHAN
BEHOLD
WE
WILL
PASS
OVER
UNTO
THESE
MEN
AND
WE
WILL
DISCOVER
OURSELVES
UNTO
THEM
IF
THEY
SAY
THUS
UNTO
US
TARRY
UNTIL
WE
COME
TO
YOU
THEN
WE
WILL
STAND
STILL
IN
OUR
PLACE
AND
WILL
NOT
GO
UP
UNTO
THEM
BUT
IF
THEY
SAY
THUS
COME
UP
UNTO
US
THEN
WE
WILL
GO
UP
FOR
THE
LORD
HATH
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
OUR
HAND
AND
THIS
SHALL
BE
A
SIGN
UNTO
US
AND
BOTH
OF
THEM
DISCOVERED
THEMSELVES
UNTO
THE
GARRISON
OF
THE
PHILISTINES
AND
THE
PHILISTINES
SAID
BEHOLD
THE
HEBREWS
COME
FORTH
OUT
OF
THE
HOLES
WHERE
THEY
HAD
HID
THEMSELVES
AND
THE
MEN
OF
THE
GARRISON
ANSWERED
JONATHAN
AND
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
AND
SAID
COME
UP
TO
US
AND
WE
WILL
SHEW
YOU
A
THING
AND
JONATHAN
SAID
UNTO
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
COME
UP
AFTER
ME
FOR
THE
LORD
HATH
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
ISRAEL
AND
JONATHAN
CLIMBED
UP
UPON
HIS
HANDS
AND
UPON
HIS
FEET
AND
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
AFTER
HIM
AND
THEY
FELL
BEFORE
JONATHAN
AND
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
SLEW
AFTER
HIM
AND
THAT
FIRST
SLAUGHTER
WHICH
JONATHAN
AND
HIS
ARMOURBEARER
MADE
WAS
ABOUT
TWENTY
MEN
WITHIN
AS
IT
WERE
AN
HALF
ACRE
OF
LAND
WHICH
A
YOKE
OF
OXEN
MIGHT
PLOW
AND
THERE
WAS
TREMBLING
IN
THE
HOST
IN
THE
FIELD
AND
AMONG
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THE
GARRISON
AND
THE
SPOILERS
THEY
ALSO
TREMBLED
AND
THE
EARTH
QUAKED
SO
IT
WAS
A
VERY
GREAT
TREMBLING
AND
THE
WATCHMEN
OF
SAUL
IN
GIBEAH
OF
BENJAMIN
LOOKED
AND
BEHOLD
THE
MULTITUDE
MELTED
AWAY
AND
THEY
WENT
ON
BEATING
DOWN

THEN
SAID
SAUL
UNTO
THE

ASSEMBLED
THEMSELVES
AND
THEY
CAME
TO
THE
BATTLE
AND
BEHOLD
EVERY

WAS
AGAINST
HIS

AND
THERE
WAS
A
VERY
GREAT
DISCOMFITURE
MOREOVER
THE
HEBREWS
THAT
WERE
WITH
THE
PHILISTINES
BEFORE
THAT
TIME
WHICH
WENT
UP
WITH

WHEREFORE

BEHOLD

FOR

IS
AS
THE
SIN
OF

WILL
NOT
LIE
NOR

IF

THEN
BE

THEREFORE
THOU
SHALT
DEAL
KINDLY

THYSELF
FOR

THEN
WOULD

WHO

ROUGHLY
AND
JONATHAN
SAID
UNTO
DAVID
COME
AND
LET
US
GO
OUT
INTO
THE
FIELD
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
BOTH
OF
THEM
INTO
THE
FIELD
AND
JONATHAN
SAID
UNTO
DAVID
O
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
WHEN
I
HAVE
SOUNDED
MY
FATHER
ABOUT

MORROW
ANY
TIME
OR
THE

AND
BEHOLD
IF

I
THEN
SEND

AND
SHEW
IT
THEE
THE
LORD
DO
SO
AND
MUCH
MORE
TO
JONATHAN
BUT
IF
IT
PLEASE
MY
FATHER
TO
DO
THEE
EVIL
THEN
I
WILL
SHEW
IT
THEE
AND
SEND
THEE
AWAY
THAT
THOU
MAYEST
GO
IN
PEACE
AND
THE
LORD
BE
WITH
THEE
AS
HE
HATH
BEEN
WITH
MY
FATHER
AND
THOU
SHALT
NOT
ONLY
WHILE
YET
I
LIVE
SHEW
ME
THE
KINDNESS
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
I
DIE
NOT
BUT
ALSO
THOU
SHALT
NOT
CUT
OFF
THY
KINDNESS
FROM
MY
HOUSE
FOR
EVER
NO
NOT
WHEN
THE
LORD
HATH
CUT
OFF
THE
ENEMIES
OF
DAVID
EVERY
ONE
FROM
THE
FACE
OF
THE
EARTH
SO
JONATHAN
MADE
A
COVENANT
WITH
THE
HOUSE
OF
DAVID
SAYING
LET
THE
LORD
EVEN
REQUIRE
IT
AT
THE
HAND
OF
DAVID'S
ENEMIES
AND
JONATHAN
CAUSED
DAVID
TO
SWEAR
AGAIN
BECAUSE
HE
LOVED
HIM
FOR
HE
LOVED
HIM
AS
HE
LOVED
HIS
OWN
SOUL
THEN
JONATHAN
SAID
TO
DAVID
TO
MORROW
IS
THE
NEW
MOON
AND
THOU
SHALT
BE
MISSED
BECAUSE
THY
SEAT
WILL
BE
EMPTY
AND
WHEN
THOU
HAST
STAYED
THREE
DAYS
THEN
THOU
SHALT
GO
DOWN
QUICKLY
AND
COME
TO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THOU
DIDST
HIDE
THYSELF
WHEN
THE
BUSINESS
WAS
IN
HAND
AND
SHALT
REMAIN
BY
THE
STONE
EZEL
AND
I
WILL
SHOOT
THREE
ARROWS
ON
THE
SIDE
THEREOF
AS
THOUGH
I
SHOT
AT
A
MARK
AND
BEHOLD
I
WILL
SEND
A
LAD
SAYING
GO
FIND
OUT
THE
ARROWS
IF
I
EXPRESSLY
SAY
UNTO
THE
LAD
BEHOLD
THE
ARROWS
ARE
ON
THIS
SIDE
OF
THEE
TAKE
THEM
THEN
COME
THOU
FOR
THERE
IS
PEACE
TO
THEE
AND
NO
HURT
AS
THE
LORD
LIVETH
BUT
IF
I
SAY
THUS
UNTO
THE
YOUNG
MAN
BEHOLD
THE
ARROWS
ARE
BEYOND
THEE
GO
THY
WAY
FOR
THE
LORD
HATH
SENT
THEE
AWAY
AND
AS
TOUCHING
THE
MATTER
WHICH
THOU
AND
I
HAVE
SPOKEN
OF
BEHOLD
THE
LORD
BE
BETWEEN
THEE
AND
ME
FOR

SO
DAVID
HID
HIMSELF
IN
THE
FIELD
AND
WHEN
THE
NEW
MOON
WAS
COME
THE
KING
SAT
HIM
DOWN
TO
EAT
MEAT
AND
THE
KING
SAT
UPON
HIS

AS
AT

EVEN
UPON
A

AND
JONATHAN
AROSE
AND
ABNER
SAT
BY
SAUL'S
SIDE
AND
DAVID'S
PLACE
WAS
EMPTY
NEVERTHELESS
SAUL
SPAKE
NOT
ANY
THING
THAT
DAY
FOR
HE
THOUGHT
SOMETHING
HATH
BEFALLEN
HIM
HE
IS
NOT
CLEAN
SURELY
HE
IS
NOT
CLEAN
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
ON
THE
MORROW
WHICH
WAS
THE
SECOND
DAY
OF
THE

THAT
DAVID'S
PLACE
WAS
EMPTY
AND
SAUL
SAID
UNTO
JONATHAN
HIS
SON
WHEREFORE
COMETH
NOT
THE
SON
OF
JESSE
TO

NEITHER
YESTERDAY
NOR
TO
DAY
AND
JONATHAN
ANSWERED
SAUL
DAVID
EARNESTLY
ASKED
LEAVE
OF
ME
TO
GO
TO
BETHLEHEM
AND
HE
SAID
LET
ME
GO
I
PRAY
THEE
FOR
OUR
FAMILY
HATH
A
SACRIFICE
IN
THE
CITY
AND
MY
BROTHER
HE
HATH
COMMANDED
ME
TO
BE
THERE
AND
NOW
IF
I
HAVE
FOUND
FAVOUR
IN
THINE
EYES
LET
ME
GET
AWAY
I
PRAY
THEE
AND
SEE
MY
BRETHREN
THEREFORE
HE
COMETH
NOT
UNTO
THE
KING'S
TABLE
THEN
SAUL'S
ANGER
WAS
KINDLED
AGAINST
JONATHAN
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
SON
OF
THE
PERVERSE
REBELLIOUS
WOMAN
DO
NOT
I
KNOW
THAT
THOU
HAST
CHOSEN
THE
SON
OF

TO
THINE

CONFUSION
AND
UNTO
THE

OF
THY

NAKEDNESS
FOR
AS
LONG
AS
THE
SON
OF

LIVETH
UPON
THE
GROUND
THOU
SHALT
NOT
BE
ESTABLISHED
NOR
THY
KINGDOM
WHEREFORE
NOW
SEND
AND
FETCH
HIM
UNTO
ME
FOR
HE
SHALL
SURELY
DIE
AND
JONATHAN
ANSWERED
SAUL
HIS
FATHER
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHEREFORE

BE
SLAIN
WHAT

AT
HIM
TO
SMITE
HIM
WHEREBY
JONATHAN
KNEW
THAT
IT
WAS
DETERMINED
OF
HIS
FATHER
TO
SLAY
DAVID
SO
JONATHAN
AROSE
FROM
THE
TABLE
IN
FIERCE
ANGER
AND
DID
EAT
NO
MEAT
THE
SECOND
DAY
OF
THE
MONTH
FOR

IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE

HE
SHOT
AN

BEYOND
HIM
AND
WHEN
THE

TO
THE
PLACE
OF

JONATHAN
CRIED

JONATHAN
CRIED
AFTER

MAKE

BUT
THE

KNEW
NOT
ANY

ONLY
JONATHAN
AND
DAVID
KNEW
THE
MATTER
AND
JONATHAN
GAVE
HIS
ARTILLERY
UNTO
HIS

THERE

NOW
A

DAVID'S
YOUNG
MEN

WERE
VERY
GOOD
UNTO
US
AND
WE
WERE
NOT

NEITHER
MISSED
WE
ANY

WALL
UNTO
US
BOTH
BY
NIGHT
AND
DAY
ALL
THE
WHILE
WE
WERE
WITH

KEEPING
THE
SHEEP
NOW
THEREFORE
KNOW
AND
CONSIDER
WHAT
THOU
WILT
DO
FOR
EVIL
IS
DETERMINED
AGAINST
OUR
MASTER
AND
AGAINST
ALL
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
FOR
HE
IS
SUCH
A
SON
OF

THAT
A

CANNOT
SPEAK
TO

THEN
ABIGAIL
MADE
HASTE

BY
THE
COVERT
ON
THE

AND
BEHOLD
DAVID
AND
HIS

CAME
DOWN
AGAINST

THEM
NOW
DAVID
HAD
SAID
SURELY
IN
VAIN
HAVE
I
KEPT
ALL
THAT
THIS
FELLOW
HATH

THE
WILDERNESS
SO
THAT
NOTHING
WAS
MISSED
OF
ALL

AND
HE
HATH
REQUITED
ME
EVIL
FOR

SO
AND
MORE
ALSO

EVEN
NABAL
FOR

BUT
I
THINE
HANDMAID
SAW
NOT
THE

THEREFORE
MY

FOUND
IN
THEE
ALL
THY

YET
A
MAN
IS
RISEN
TO
PURSUE
THEE

THY

AND
THE
SOULS

THEM
SHALL

AND
IT
SHALL
COME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE

SHALL
HAVE
DONE

WHOM
THEY
SANG
ONE
TO

IN

SAYING
SAUL
SLEW
HIS

THAT
I
MAY
NOT

AND
ACHISH
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
TO

INTO
THE
LAND
OF

AND
THE

WHEN
DAVID
AND
HIS

TO
ZIKLAG
ON
THE
THIRD

THAT
THE

HAD
TAKEN
THE

CAPTIVES
THAT

THEREIN
THEY
SLEW
NOT
ANY
EITHER

BUT
CARRIED
THEM
AWAY
AND

AND
BEHOLD
IT
WAS
BURNED
WITH

AND
THEIR

AHINOAM
THE

THE

AND
DAVID
WAS
GREATLY
DISTRESSED
FOR
THE

SPAKE
OF

HIM
BECAUSE
THE
SOUL
OF
ALL
THE

WAS
GRIEVED
EVERY
MAN
FOR
HIS
SONS
AND
FOR
HIS
DAUGHTERS
BUT
DAVID
ENCOURAGED
HIMSELF
IN
THE
LORD
HIS
GOD
AND
DAVID
SAID
TO

THE
PRIEST
AHIMELECH'S
SON
I
PRAY
THEE
BRING

HITHER
THE
EPHOD
AND
ABIATHAR
BROUGHT

OVERTAKE
THEM
AND
HE

HIM
PURSUE
FOR
THOU
SHALT
SURELY
OVERTAKE
THEM
AND
WITHOUT

RECOVER
ALL
SO
DAVID
WENT
HE
AND
THE
SIX
HUNDRED
MEN
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
AND
CAME
TO
THE
BROOK
BESOR
WHERE
THOSE
THAT
WERE
LEFT
BEHIND
STAYED
BUT
DAVID
PURSUED
HE
AND
FOUR
HUNDRED
MEN
FOR
TWO
HUNDRED
ABODE
BEHIND
WHICH
WERE
SO
FAINT
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
GO
OVER
THE
BROOK
BESOR
AND
THEY
FOUND
AN
EGYPTIAN
IN
THE
FIELD
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
DAVID
AND
GAVE
HIM
BREAD
AND
HE
DID
EAT
AND
THEY
MADE
HIM
DRINK
WATER
AND
THEY
GAVE
HIM
A
PIECE
OF
A
CAKE
OF
FIGS
AND
TWO
CLUSTERS
OF
RAISINS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
EATEN
HIS
SPIRIT
CAME
AGAIN
TO
HIM
FOR
HE
HAD
EATEN
NO
BREAD
NOR
DRUNK
ANY
WATER
THREE
DAYS
AND
THREE
NIGHTS
AND
DAVID
SAID
UNTO
HIM
TO
WHOM
BELONGEST
THOU
AND
WHENCE
ART
THOU
AND
HE
SAID
I
AM
A
YOUNG
MAN
OF
EGYPT
SERVANT
TO

AND
MY

BECAUSE
THREE

AGONE
I

OF
THE
CHERETHITES
AND
UPON
THE

WHICH
BELONGETH
TO
JUDAH
AND
UPON
THE
SOUTH
OF
CALEB
AND
WE
BURNED
ZIKLAG
WITH
FIRE
AND
DAVID
SAID
TO
HIM
CANST
THOU
BRING
ME
DOWN
TO
THIS
COMPANY
AND
HE
SAID
SWEAR
UNTO
ME
BY
GOD
THAT
THOU
WILT
NEITHER
KILL
ME
NOR
DELIVER
ME
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
MY
MASTER
AND
I
WILL
BRING
THEE
DOWN
TO
THIS
COMPANY
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
BROUGHT
HIM
DOWN
BEHOLD
THEY
WERE
SPREAD
ABROAD
UPON
ALL
THE
EARTH
EATING
AND
DRINKING
AND
DANCING
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THE
GREAT
SPOIL
THAT
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
THE
PHILISTINES
AND
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
JUDAH
AND
DAVID
SMOTE
THEM
FROM
THE

EVEN
UNTO
THE
EVENING
OF
THE
NEXT
DAY
AND
THERE
ESCAPED
NOT
A
MAN
OF
THEM
SAVE
FOUR
HUNDRED
YOUNG
MEN
WHICH
RODE
UPON
CAMELS
AND
FLED
AND
DAVID
RECOVERED
ALL
THAT
THE
AMALEKITES
HAD
CARRIED
AWAY
AND
DAVID
RESCUED
HIS
TWO
WIVES
AND
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
LACKING
TO
THEM
NEITHER
SMALL
NOR
GREAT
NEITHER
SONS
NOR
DAUGHTERS
NEITHER
SPOIL
NOR
ANY
THING
THAT
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
TO
THEM
DAVID
RECOVERED
ALL
AND
DAVID
TOOK
ALL
THE
FLOCKS
AND
THE
HERDS
WHICH
THEY
DRAVE
BEFORE
THOSE
OTHER
CATTLE
AND
SAID
THIS
IS
DAVID'S
SPOIL
AND
DAVID
CAME
TO
THE
TWO
HUNDRED
MEN
WHICH
WERE
SO
FAINT
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
FOLLOW
DAVID
WHOM
THEY
HAD
MADE
ALSO
TO
ABIDE
AT
THE
BROOK
BESOR
AND
THEY
WENT
FORTH
TO
MEET
DAVID
AND
TO
MEET
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
AND
WHEN
DAVID
CAME
NEAR
TO
THE
PEOPLE
HE
SALUTED
THEM
THEN
ANSWERED
ALL
THE
WICKED
MEN
AND
MEN
OF
BELIAL
OF
THOSE
THAT
WENT
WITH
DAVID
AND
SAID
BECAUSE
THEY
WENT
NOT

NOT
GIVE
THEM
OUGHT
OF
THE
SPOIL
THAT
WE
HAVE
RECOVERED
SAVE
TO
EVERY
MAN
HIS
WIFE
AND
HIS
CHILDREN
THAT
THEY
MAY
LEAD
THEM

THEN
SAID
DAVID
YE
SHALL
NOT
DO
SO
MY
BRETHREN
WITH
THAT
WHICH
THE
LORD
HATH

US
WHO
HATH
PRESERVED
US
AND
DELIVERED
THE
COMPANY
THAT
CAME
AGAINST
US
INTO
OUR
HAND
FOR
WHO
WILL
HEARKEN
UNTO
YOU
IN
THIS
MATTER
BUT
AS
HIS

GOETH
DOWN
TO
THE
BATTLE
SO
SHALL
HIS
PART
BE
THAT
TARRIETH
BY
THE
STUFF
THEY

SOLE
OF
HIS
FOOT
EVEN
TO
THE
CROWN
OF
HIS

THERE
WAS
NO
BLEMISH
IN
HIM
AND
WHEN
HE
POLLED
HIS
HEAD
FOR
IT
WAS
AT
EVERY
YEAR'S
END
THAT
HE
POLLED
IT
BECAUSE
THE
HAIR
WAS
HEAVY
ON

THEREFORE
HE
POLLED

COUNTENANCE
SO
ABSALOM
DWELT
TWO
FULL
YEARS
IN

AND
SAW
NOT

THEREFORE
ABSALOM
SENT
FOR

BUT
HE
WOULD
NOT
COME
TO

AND
WHEN

HE
WOULD
NOT

HE
SAID
UNTO
HIS

HATH
BARLEY
THERE
GO

UNTO

KILL
ME
SO
JOAB
CAME
TO
THE

BEHOLD
ALL
THE

CAME

WHY

THE

AND

COST
OR

AND
THE

ANSWERED
THE
MEN
OF
JUDAH
AND
SAID
WE
HAVE
TEN
PARTS
IN
THE
KING
AND
WE
HAVE
ALSO
MORE
RIGHT
IN
DAVID
THAN
YE
WHY
THEN
DID
YE
DESPISE
US
THAT
OUR
ADVICE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
FIRST
HAD
IN
BRINGING
BACK
OUR
KING
AND
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
MEN
OF
JUDAH
WERE
FIERCER
THAN
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
THERE
HAPPENED
TO
BE
THERE
A
MAN
OF
BELIAL
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
SHEBA
THE
SON
OF
BICHRI
A
BENJAMITE
AND
HE
BLEW
A
TRUMPET
AND
SAID
WE

NO
PART
IN
DAVID
NEITHER
HAVE
WE
INHERITANCE
IN
THE
SON
OF
JESSE
EVERY
MAN
TO
HIS
TENTS
O
ISRAEL
SO
EVERY
MAN
OF
ISRAEL
WENT
UP
FROM
AFTER
DAVID
AND
FOLLOWED
SHEBA
THE
SON
OF
BICHRI
BUT
THE
MEN
OF

CLAVE
UNTO
THEIR

FROM

EVEN
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
DAVID
CAME
TO
HIS
HOUSE
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
THE
KING
TOOK
THE
TEN
WOMEN
HIS
CONCUBINES
WHOM
HE
HAD
LEFT
TO
KEEP
THE
HOUSE
AND
PUT
THEM
IN
WARD
AND
FED
THEM
BUT
WENT
NOT
IN
UNTO
THEM
SO
THEY
WERE
SHUT
UP
UNTO
THE
DAY
OF
THEIR
DEATH
LIVING
IN
WIDOWHOOD
THEN
SAID
THE
KING
TO
AMASA
ASSEMBLE
ME
THE
MEN
OF
JUDAH
WITHIN
THREE
DAYS
AND
BE
THOU
HERE
PRESENT
SO
AMASA
WENT
TO
ASSEMBLE
THE
MEN
OF
JUDAH
BUT
HE
TARRIED
LONGER
THAN
THE
SET
TIME
WHICH
HE
HAD
APPOINTED
HIM
AND
DAVID
SAID
TO
ABISHAI
NOW
SHALL
SHEBA
THE
SON
OF
BICHRI
DO
US
MORE
HARM
THAN
DID
ABSALOM
TAKE
THOU
THY
LORD'S
SERVANTS
AND
PURSUE
AFTER
HIM
LEST
HE
GET
HIM
FENCED
CITIES
AND
ESCAPE
US
AND
THERE
WENT
OUT
AFTER
HIM
JOAB'S
MEN
AND
THE
CHERETHITES
AND
THE
PELETHITES
AND
ALL
THE
MIGHTY
MEN
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
OF

TO
PURSUE
AFTER
SHEBA
THE
SON
OF
BICHRI
WHEN
THEY
WERE
AT
THE
GREAT
STONE
WHICH
IS
IN
GIBEON
AMASA
WENT
BEFORE
THEM
AND
JOAB'S
GARMENT
THAT
HE
HAD
PUT
ON
WAS
GIRDED
UNTO
HIM
AND
UPON
IT
A
GIRDLE
WITH
A
SWORD
FASTENED
UPON
HIS
LOINS
IN
THE
SHEATH
THEREOF
AND
AS
HE
WENT
FORTH
IT
FELL
OUT
AND
JOAB
SAID
TO
AMASA
ART
THOU
IN
HEALTH
MY
BROTHER
AND
JOAB
TOOK
AMASA
BY
THE
BEARD
WITH
THE
RIGHT
HAND
TO
KISS
HIM
BUT
AMASA
TOOK
NO
HEED
TO
THE
SWORD
THAT
WAS
IN
JOAB'S
HAND
SO
HE
SMOTE
HIM
THEREWITH
IN
THE
FIFTH
RIB
AND
SHED
OUT
HIS
BOWELS
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
STRUCK
HIM
NOT

AND
HE
DIED
SO
JOAB
AND
ABISHAI
HIS

PURSUED
AFTER
SHEBA
THE
SON
OF

LET

ALL
THE
PEOPLE
STOOD
STILL
HE
REMOVED
AMASA
OUT
OF
THE
HIGHWAY
INTO
THE
FIELD
AND
CAST
A

UPON
HIM
WHEN
HE
SAW
THAT
EVERY

ALL

THAT
MY

THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE

OF

AND
FOUND
ABISHAG
A

OF
THY

WHICH
THOU
HAST
CHOSEN
A

PEOPLE
THAT
CANNOT
BE
NUMBERED

FOR

NEITHER
HAST
ASKED

FOR

SO
THAT
THERE
SHALL
NOT
BE
ANY
AMONG

THOU
WILT
WALK
IN

THERE
THEY

UNTO
THIS

THERE

SAVE
THE

OFFERED
SACRIFICE
BEFORE

OFFERED
A

WHICH

OFFERED
UNTO
THE

TWO

TWENTY

TWENTY

SHEEP
SO
THE
KING
AND
ALL
THE

DEDICATED
THE

THE

DAY
DID
THE
KING
HALLOW
THE

OF
THE
LORD
FOR
THERE
HE
OFFERED
BURNT
OFFERINGS
AND
MEAT
OFFERINGS
AND
THE

BECAUSE
THE

ALTAR
THAT

WAS
TOO
LITTLE
TO
RECEIVE
THE
BURNT
OFFERINGS

MEAT
OFFERINGS
AND

SOLOMON

JOYFUL

OF
HEART
FOR
ALL
THE
GOODNESS
THAT
THE
LORD
HAD
DONE
FOR
DAVID
HIS

AND
FOR
ISRAEL
HIS

AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
SOLOMON
HAD
FINISHED
THE
BUILDING
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
THE
KING'S
HOUSE
AND
ALL
SOLOMON'S
DESIRE
WHICH
HE
WAS
PLEASED
TO
DO
THAT
THE
LORD
APPEARED
TO
SOLOMON
THE
SECOND
TIME
AS
HE
HAD
APPEARED
UNTO
HIM
AT
GIBEON
AND
THE

SAID
UNTO
HIM
I
HAVE
HEARD
THY

AND
THY
SUPPLICATION
THAT
THOU
HAST
MADE
BEFORE
ME
I
HAVE
HALLOWED
THIS

THERE
PERPETUALLY
AND
IF
THOU
WILT
WALK
BEFORE
ME
AS
DAVID
THY
FATHER
WALKED
IN
INTEGRITY
OF
HEART
AND
IN
UPRIGHTNESS
TO
DO
ACCORDING
TO
ALL
THAT
I
HAVE
COMMANDED
THEE
AND
WILT
KEEP
MY
STATUTES
AND
MY
JUDGMENTS
THEN
I
WILL
ESTABLISH
THE
THRONE
OF
THY
KINGDOM
UPON
ISRAEL
FOR
EVER
AS
I
PROMISED
TO
DAVID
THY
FATHER
SAYING
THERE
SHALL
NOT
FAIL
THEE
A
MAN
UPON
THE
THRONE
OF
ISRAEL
BUT
IF
YE
SHALL
AT
ALL
TURN
FROM
FOLLOWING
ME
YE
OR
YOUR
CHILDREN
AND
WILL
NOT
KEEP
MY
COMMANDMENTS
AND
MY
STATUTES
WHICH
I
HAVE
SET
BEFORE
YOU
BUT
GO
AND
SERVE
OTHER
GODS
AND
WORSHIP
THEM
THEN
WILL
I
CUT
OFF
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
WHICH
I
HAVE
GIVEN
THEM
AND
THIS
HOUSE
WHICH
I
HAVE
HALLOWED
FOR
MY
NAME
WILL
I
CAST
OUT
OF
MY
SIGHT
AND
ISRAEL
SHALL
BE
A
PROVERB
AND
A
BYWORD
AMONG
ALL
PEOPLE
AND
AT
THIS
HOUSE
WHICH
IS
HIGH
EVERY
ONE
THAT
PASSETH
BY
IT
SHALL
BE
ASTONISHED
AND
SHALL
HISS
AND
THEY
SHALL
SAY
WHY
HATH
THE
LORD
DONE
THUS
UNTO
THIS
LAND
AND
TO
THIS
HOUSE
AND
THEY
SHALL
ANSWER
BECAUSE
THEY
FORSOOK
THE
LORD
THEIR
GOD
WHO
BROUGHT
FORTH
THEIR
FATHERS
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
AND
HAVE
TAKEN
HOLD
UPON
OTHER
GODS
AND
HAVE
WORSHIPPED
THEM
AND
SERVED
THEM
THEREFORE
HATH
THE
LORD
BROUGHT
UPON
THEM
ALL
THIS
EVIL
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THE
END
OF
TWENTY
YEARS
WHEN
SOLOMON
HAD
BUILT
THE
TWO
HOUSES
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
THE
KING'S
HOUSE
NOW
HIRAM
THE
KING
OF
TYRE
HAD
FURNISHED
SOLOMON
WITH
CEDAR
TREES
AND
FIR
TREES
AND
WITH
GOLD
ACCORDING
TO
ALL
HIS
DESIRE
THAT
THEN
KING
SOLOMON
GAVE
HIRAM
TWENTY
CITIES
IN
THE
LAND
OF
GALILEE
AND
HIRAM
CAME
OUT
FROM
TYRE
TO
SEE
THE
CITIES
WHICH
SOLOMON
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
AND
THEY
PLEASED
HIM
NOT
AND
HE
SAID
WHAT
CITIES
ARE
THESE
WHICH
THOU
HAST
GIVEN
ME
MY
BROTHER
AND
HE
CALLED
THEM
THE
LAND
OF
CABUL
UNTO
THIS
DAY
AND
HIRAM
SENT
TO
THE
KING
SIXSCORE
TALENTS
OF
GOLD
AND
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
OF
THE
LEVY
WHICH
KING
SOLOMON
RAISED
FOR
TO
BUILD
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
AND
MILLO
AND
THE
WALL
OF
JERUSALEM
AND
HAZOR
AND
MEGIDDO
AND
GEZER
FOR
PHARAOH
KING
OF
EGYPT
HAD
GONE
UP
AND
TAKEN
GEZER
AND
BURNT
IT
WITH
FIRE
AND
SLAIN
THE
CANAANITES
THAT
DWELT
IN
THE
CITY
AND
GIVEN
IT
FOR
A
PRESENT
UNTO
HIS
DAUGHTER
SOLOMON'S
WIFE
AND
SOLOMON
BUILT
GEZER
AND
BETHHORON
THE
NETHER
AND
BAALATH
AND
TADMOR
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
IN
THE
LAND
AND
ALL
THE
CITIES
OF
STORE
THAT
SOLOMON
HAD
AND
CITIES
FOR
HIS
CHARIOTS
AND
CITIES
FOR
HIS
HORSEMEN
AND
THAT
WHICH
SOLOMON
DESIRED
TO
BUILD
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
IN
LEBANON
AND
IN
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
HIS
DOMINION
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
LEFT
OF
THE
AMORITES
HITTITES
PERIZZITES
HIVITES
AND
JEBUSITES
WHICH
WERE
NOT
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
THEIR
CHILDREN
THAT
WERE
LEFT
AFTER
THEM
IN
THE
LAND
WHOM
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
ALSO
WERE
NOT
ABLE
UTTERLY
TO
DESTROY
UPON
THOSE
DID
SOLOMON
LEVY
A
TRIBUTE
OF
BONDSERVICE
UNTO
THIS
DAY
BUT
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
DID
SOLOMON
MAKE
NO
BONDMEN
BUT
THEY
WERE
MEN
OF
WAR
AND
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
HIS
PRINCES
AND
HIS
CAPTAINS
AND
RULERS
OF
HIS
CHARIOTS
AND
HIS
HORSEMEN
THESE
WERE
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
OFFICERS
THAT
WERE
OVER
SOLOMON'S
WORK
FIVE
HUNDRED
AND
FIFTY
WHICH
BARE
RULE
OVER
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WROUGHT
IN
THE
WORK
BUT
PHARAOH'S
DAUGHTER
CAME
UP
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
UNTO
HER
HOUSE
WHICH
SOLOMON
HAD
BUILT
FOR
HER
THEN
DID
HE
BUILD
MILLO
AND
THREE
TIMES
IN
A
YEAR
DID
SOLOMON
OFFER
BURNT
OFFERINGS
AND
PEACE
OFFERINGS
UPON
THE
ALTAR
WHICH
HE
BUILT
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
HE
BURNT
INCENSE
UPON
THE
ALTAR
THAT
WAS
BEFORE
THE
LORD
SO
HE
FINISHED
THE
HOUSE
AND
KING
SOLOMON
MADE
A
NAVY
OF
SHIPS
IN
EZIONGEBER
WHICH
IS
BESIDE
ELOTH
ON
THE
SHORE
OF
THE
RED
SEA
IN
THE
LAND
OF
EDOM
AND
HIRAM
SENT
IN
THE
NAVY
HIS
SERVANTS
SHIPMEN
THAT
HAD
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
SEA
WITH
THE
SERVANTS
OF
SOLOMON
AND
THEY
CAME
TO
OPHIR
AND
FETCHED
FROM
THENCE
GOLD
FOUR
HUNDRED

TWENTY
TALENTS
AND
BROUGHT
IT
TO
KING
SOLOMON
AND
WHEN
THE
QUEEN
OF
SHEBA
HEARD
OF
THE
FAME
OF
SOLOMON
CONCERNING
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
SHE
CAME
TO
PROVE
HIM
WITH
HARD
QUESTIONS
AND
SHE
CAME
TO
JERUSALEM
WITH
A
VERY
GREAT
TRAIN
WITH
CAMELS
THAT
BARE
SPICES
AND
VERY
MUCH
GOLD
AND
PRECIOUS
STONES
AND
WHEN
SHE
WAS
COME
TO
SOLOMON
SHE
COMMUNED
WITH
HIM
OF
ALL
THAT
WAS
IN
HER
HEART
AND
SOLOMON
TOLD
HER
ALL
HER
QUESTIONS
THERE
WAS
NOT
ANY
THING
HID
FROM
THE
KING
WHICH
HE
TOLD
HER
NOT
AND
WHEN
THE
QUEEN
OF
SHEBA
HAD
SEEN
ALL
SOLOMON'S
WISDOM
AND
THE

AND
THE

OF
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
THE

OF
HIS
MINISTERS
AND
THEIR
APPAREL
AND
HIS
CUPBEARERS
AND
HIS
ASCENT
BY
WHICH
HE
WENT
UP
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
THERE
WAS
NO
MORE
SPIRIT
IN
HER
AND
SHE
SAID
TO
THE
KING

A
TRUE
REPORT
THAT

HOWBEIT
I
BELIEVED

SEEN
IT
AND
BEHOLD
THE

PROSPERITY
EXCEEDETH
THE

WOMEN
OF
THE
MOABITES
AMMONITES
EDOMITES
ZIDONIANS
AND

SAID
UNTO
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
YE
SHALL
NOT
GO
IN
TO
THEM
NEITHER
SHALL
THEY
COME
IN
UNTO
YOU
FOR
SURELY
THEY
WILL
TURN
AWAY
YOUR

AFTER
THEIR
GODS
SOLOMON
CLAVE
UNTO
THESE
IN
LOVE
AND
HE
HAD
SEVEN
HUNDRED
WIVES
PRINCESSES
AND
THREE
HUNDRED
CONCUBINES
AND
HIS
WIVES
TURNED
AWAY
HIS
HEART
FOR
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
SOLOMON
WAS
OLD
THAT
HIS
WIVES
TURNED
AWAY
HIS
HEART
AFTER
OTHER
GODS
AND
HIS
HEART
WAS
NOT
PERFECT
WITH
THE
LORD
HIS
GOD
AS
WAS
THE
HEART
OF

OF
MOAB
IN
THE
HILL
THAT
IS
BEFORE
JERUSALEM
AND
FOR

AND
LIKEWISE
DID
HE
FOR
ALL
HIS
STRANGE
WIVES
WHICH
BURNT
INCENSE
AND
SACRIFICED
UNTO
THEIR
GODS
AND
THE
LORD
WAS
ANGRY
WITH
SOLOMON
BECAUSE
HIS
HEART
WAS
TURNED
FROM
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
WHICH
HAD
APPEARED
UNTO
HIM
TWICE
AND
HAD
COMMANDED
HIM
CONCERNING
THIS
THING
THAT

SHOULD
NOT
GO
AFTER

I
WILL
REND
IT
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF

HOWBEIT
I
WILL
NOT
REND
AWAY
ALL
THE
KINGDOM
BUT
WILL
GIVE
ONE
TRIBE
TO
THY
SON
FOR
DAVID
MY
SERVANT'S
SAKE
AND
FOR
JERUSALEM'S
SAKE
WHICH
I

STIRRED
UP
AN
ADVERSARY
UNTO
SOLOMON
HADAD
THE
EDOMITE
HE
WAS
OF
THE

WAS
GONE
UP
TO
BURY
THE
SLAIN
AFTER

KING
OF

WHICH
GAVE

AND
APPOINTED
HIM
VICTUALS
AND
GAVE
HIM
LAND
AND
HADAD
FOUND
GREAT
FAVOUR
IN
THE

AND
GENUBATH
WAS
IN
PHARAOH'S
HOUSEHOLD
AMONG
THE
SONS
OF

AND
WHEN
HADAD
HEARD
IN

THAT
DAVID
SLEPT
WITH

AND
THAT
JOAB
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE

HADAD
SAID
TO

THOU
SEEKEST
TO
GO
TO
THINE

AND
HE
ANSWERED
NOTHING
HOWBEIT
LET

GOD
STIRRED
HIM
UP
ANOTHER
ADVERSARY
REZON
THE
SON
OF
ELIADAH
WHICH
FLED
FROM
HIS
LORD
HADADEZER
KING
OF
ZOBAH
AND
HE
GATHERED
MEN
UNTO
HIM
AND
BECAME
CAPTAIN
OVER
A
BAND
WHEN
DAVID
SLEW
THEM
OF
ZOBAH
AND
THEY
WENT
TO
DAMASCUS
AND
DWELT
THEREIN
AND
REIGNED
IN
DAMASCUS
AND
HE
WAS
AN
ADVERSARY
TO
ISRAEL
ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
SOLOMON
BESIDE
THE
MISCHIEF
THAT
HADAD
DID
AND
HE
ABHORRED

AN

SOLOMON'S
SERVANT
WHOSE
MOTHER'S
NAME
WAS
ZERUAH
A
WIDOW
WOMAN
EVEN
HE
LIFTED
UP
HIS
HAND
AGAINST
THE
KING
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
CAUSE
THAT
HE
LIFTED
UP
HIS
HAND
AGAINST
THE
KING
SOLOMON
BUILT
MILLO
AND
REPAIRED
THE
BREACHES
OF
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
HIS
FATHER
AND
THE
MAN
JEROBOAM
WAS
A
MIGHTY
MAN
OF
VALOUR
AND
SOLOMON
SEEING
THE
YOUNG
MAN
THAT
HE
WAS
INDUSTRIOUS
HE
MADE
HIM
RULER
OVER
ALL
THE
CHARGE
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF

AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THAT
TIME
WHEN
JEROBOAM
WENT
OUT
OF

THAT
THE
PROPHET
AHIJAH
THE
SHILONITE
FOUND
HIM
IN

AND
HE
SAID
TO

FOR
THUS
SAITH
THE
LORD
THE
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
BEHOLD
I
WILL
REND
THE
KINGDOM
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF

AND
WILL
GIVE
TEN

BUT
HE

THERE
CAME
A
MAN
OF
GOD
AND
SPAKE
UNTO
THE
KING
OF
ISRAEL
AND
SAID
THUS
SAITH
THE
LORD
BECAUSE
THE
SYRIANS
HAVE
SAID
THE
LORD
IS
GOD
OF
THE
HILLS
BUT
HE
IS
NOT
GOD
OF
THE
VALLEYS
THEREFORE
WILL
I
DELIVER
ALL

BENHADAD
FLED
AND
CAME
INTO
THE
CITY
INTO
AN
INNER
CHAMBER
AND
HIS
SERVANTS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
BEHOLD
NOW
WE
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
KINGS
OF

MERCIFUL
KINGS
LET

PERADVENTURE
HE

AND
CAME
TO
THE
KING
OF

BENHADAD
SAITH
I
PRAY
THEE
LET

NOW
THE
MEN
DID
DILIGENTLY
OBSERVE
WHETHER
ANY
THING
WOULD
COME
FROM
HIM
AND
DID
HASTILY
CATCH
IT
AND
THEY
SAID
THY
BROTHER
BENHADAD
THEN
HE
SAID
GO
YE
BRING
HIM
THEN
BENHADAD
CAME
FORTH
TO
HIM
AND
HE
CAUSED
HIM
TO
COME
UP
INTO
THE
CHARIOT
AND
BEN-HADAD
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THE
CITIES
WHICH
MY

I
WILL
RESTORE
AND
THOU
SHALT
MAKE
STREETS
FOR
THEE
IN
DAMASCUS
AS
MY
FATHER
MADE
IN
SAMARIA
THEN
SAID
AHAB
I
WILL
SEND
THEE
AWAY
WITH
THIS
COVENANT
SO
HE
MADE
A
COVENANT
WITH
HIM
AND
SENT
HIM
AWAY
AND
A
CERTAIN
MAN
OF
THE
SONS
OF
THE
PROPHETS
SAID
UNTO
HIS
NEIGHBOUR
IN
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
SMITE
ME
I
PRAY
THEE
AND
THE
MAN
REFUSED
TO
SMITE
HIM
THEN
SAID
HE
UNTO
HIM
BECAUSE
THOU
HAST

OBEYED
THE
VOICE
OF
THE

BEHOLD
AS

A

AND
SAID
SMITE
ME
I
PRAY
THEE
AND
THE
MAN
SMOTE
HIM
SO
THAT
IN
SMITING
HE
WOUNDED
HIM
SO
THE
PROPHET
DEPARTED
AND
WAITED
FOR
THE
KING
BY
THE
WAY
AND
DISGUISED
HIMSELF
WITH
ASHES
UPON
HIS
FACE
AND
AS
THE
KING
PASSED
BY
HE
CRIED
UNTO
THE
KING
AND
HE
SAID
THY
SERVANT
WENT
OUT
INTO
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
BATTLE
AND
BEHOLD
A
MAN
TURNED
ASIDE
AND
BROUGHT
A
MAN
UNTO
ME
AND
SAID
KEEP
THIS
MAN
IF
BY
ANY
MEANS
HE
BE
MISSING
THEN
SHALL
THY
LIFE
BE
FOR
HIS
LIFE
OR
ELSE
THOU
SHALT
PAY
A
TALENT
OF
SILVER
AND
AS
THY
SERVANT
WAS
BUSY
HERE
AND
THERE
HE
WAS
GONE
AND
THE
KING
OF
ISRAEL
SAID
UNTO
HIM
SO
SHALL
THY
JUDGMENT
BE
THYSELF
HAST
DECIDED
IT
AND
HE
HASTED
AND
TOOK
THE
ASHES
AWAY
FROM

DISCERNED
HIM
THAT

DESTRUCTION
THEREFORE
THY

FOR

SAID
ALAS
THAT
THE

HATH
CALLED

BUT
JEHOSHAPHAT
SAID
IS

MAY
ENQUIRE
OF

WHICH
POURED
WATER
ON
THE
HANDS
OF
ELIJAH
AND
JEHOSHAPHAT
SAID
THE

HIM
NAY
FOR
THE

BUT
NOW
BRING

YET
THAT
VALLEY
SHALL
BE
FILLED
WITH
WATER
THAT
YE
MAY
DRINK
BOTH
YE
AND
YOUR
CATTLE
AND
YOUR
BEASTS
AND
THIS
IS
BUT
A
LIGHT
THING
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
HE
WILL
DELIVER
THE
MOABITES
ALSO
INTO
YOUR
HAND
AND
YE
SHALL
SMITE
EVERY
FENCED
CITY
AND
EVERY
CHOICE
CITY
AND
SHALL
FELL
EVERY
GOOD
TREE
AND
STOP
ALL
WELLS
OF
WATER

AND
WHEN
ALL
THE

HEARD
THAT
THE
KINGS
WERE
COME
UP
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
THEM
THEY
GATHERED
ALL
THAT
WERE
ABLE
TO
PUT
ON
ARMOUR
AND
UPWARD
AND
STOOD
IN
THE

AND
THEY
ROSE
UP
EARLY
IN

SHONE
UPON

ANOTHER
NOW
THEREFORE

THE

THE
MOABITES
SO
THAT
THEY
FLED

THEN
JEHU
CAME
FORTH

AND
THUS
SPAKE
HE
TO

SAYING
THUS
SAITH
THE
LORD
I
HAVE
ANOINTED
THEE
KING
OVER

THEN
THEY
HASTED
AND
TOOK
EVERY

GARMENT
AND
PUT
IT
UNDER
HIM
ON
THE
TOP
OF
THE
STAIRS
AND
BLEW
WITH
TRUMPETS
SAYING
JEHU
IS

SO
JEHU
THE
SON
OF
JEHOSHAPHAT
THE

CONSPIRED
AGAINST
JORAM
NOW
JORAM
HAD
KEPT
RAMOTHGILEAD
HE
AND

OF
THE
WOUNDS
WHICH
THE

HAD
GIVEN

MINDS
THEN
LET
NONE
GO
FORTH
NOR
ESCAPE
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
TO
GO
TO

FOR

AND
AHAZIAH
KING
OF

JORAM
SAID
TAKE
AN

HIM
AND
SAID
THUS

THE

AND
JEHU
SAID

AND
THE

TOLD
SAYING
HE

DRIVETH
FURIOUSLY
AND
JORAM
SAID
MAKE

WAS
MADE
READY
AND
JORAM
KING
OF

AND
AHAZIAH
KING

WENT
OUT
AGAINST
JEHU

SO
MANY
AND
JORAM
TURNED
HIS

AND
FLED
AND
SAID
TO
AHAZIAH
THERE

TREACHERY
O

WAYS
AND
KEEP
MY
COMMANDMENTS
AND
MY
STATUTES
ACCORDING
TO
ALL
THE
LAW
WHICH
I
COMMANDED
YOUR
FATHERS
AND
WHICH
I
SENT
TO
YOU
BY
MY
SERVANTS
THE
PROPHETS
NOTWITHSTANDING
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HEAR
BUT
HARDENED
THEIR
NECKS
LIKE
TO
THE
NECK
OF
THEIR
FATHERS
THAT
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
LORD
THEIR
GOD
AND
THEY
REJECTED
HIS
STATUTES
AND
HIS
COVENANT
THAT
HE
MADE
WITH
THEIR
FATHERS
AND
HIS
TESTIMONIES
WHICH
HE
TESTIFIED
AGAINST
THEM
AND
THEY
FOLLOWED
VANITY
AND
BECAME
VAIN
AND
WENT
AFTER
THE
HEATHEN
THAT
WERE
ROUND
ABOUT
THEM
CONCERNING
WHOM
THE
LORD
HAD
CHARGED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
DO
LIKE
THEM
AND
THEY
LEFT
ALL
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
THE
LORD
THEIR
GOD
AND
MADE
THEM
MOLTEN
IMAGES
EVEN
TWO
CALVES
AND
MADE
A
GROVE
AND
WORSHIPPED
ALL
THE
HOST
OF
HEAVEN
AND
SERVED
BAAL
AND
THEY
CAUSED
THEIR
SONS
AND
THEIR
DAUGHTERS
TO
PASS
THROUGH
THE
FIRE
AND
USED
DIVINATION
AND
ENCHANTMENTS
AND
SOLD
THEMSELVES
TO
DO
EVIL
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
TO
PROVOKE
HIM
TO
ANGER
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
WAS
VERY
ANGRY
WITH
ISRAEL
AND
REMOVED
THEM
OUT
OF
HIS
SIGHT
THERE
WAS
NONE
LEFT
BUT
THE
TRIBE
OF
JUDAH
ONLY
ALSO
JUDAH
KEPT
NOT
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
THE
LORD
THEIR
GOD
BUT
WALKED
IN
THE
STATUTES
OF
ISRAEL
WHICH
THEY
MADE
AND
THE
LORD
REJECTED
ALL
THE
SEED
OF
ISRAEL
AND
AFFLICTED
THEM
AND
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
SPOILERS
UNTIL
HE
HAD
CAST
THEM
OUT
OF
HIS
SIGHT
FOR
HE
RENT
ISRAEL
FROM
THE
HOUSE
OF
DAVID
AND
THEY
MADE
JEROBOAM
THE
SON
OF
NEBAT
KING
AND
JEROBOAM
DRAVE
ISRAEL
FROM
FOLLOWING
THE
LORD
AND
MADE
THEM
SIN
A
GREAT
SIN
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
WALKED
IN
ALL
THE
SINS
OF
JEROBOAM
WHICH
HE
DID
THEY
DEPARTED
NOT
FROM
THEM
UNTIL
THE
LORD
REMOVED
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
HIS
SIGHT
AS
HE
HAD
SAID
BY
ALL
HIS
SERVANTS
THE
PROPHETS
SO
WAS
ISRAEL
CARRIED
AWAY
OUT
OF
THEIR
OWN
LAND
TO
ASSYRIA
UNTO
THIS
DAY
AND
THE
KING
OF
ASSYRIA
BROUGHT
MEN
FROM
BABYLON
AND
FROM
CUTHAH
AND
FROM

AND
FROM
HAMATH
AND
FROM
SEPHARVAIM
AND
PLACED
THEM
IN
THE
CITIES
OF
SAMARIA
INSTEAD
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
THEY
POSSESSED
SAMARIA
AND
DWELT
IN
THE
CITIES
THEREOF
AND
SO
IT
WAS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THEIR
DWELLING
THERE
THAT
THEY
FEARED
NOT
THE
LORD
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
SENT
LIONS
AMONG
THEM
WHICH
SLEW
SOME
OF
THEM
WHEREFORE
THEY
SPAKE
TO
THE
KING
OF
ASSYRIA
SAYING
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
THOU
HAST
REMOVED
AND
PLACED
IN
THE
CITIES
OF
SAMARIA
KNOW
NOT
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
GOD
OF
THE
LAND
THEREFORE
HE
HATH
SENT
LIONS
AMONG
THEM
AND
BEHOLD
THEY
SLAY
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
NOT
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
GOD
OF
THE
LAND
THEN
THE
KING
OF
ASSYRIA
COMMANDED
SAYING
CARRY
THITHER
ONE
OF
THE
PRIESTS
WHOM
YE
BROUGHT
FROM
THENCE
AND
LET
THEM
GO
AND
DWELL
THERE
AND
LET
HIM
TEACH

THE
MANNER
OF
THE

THEN
ONE
OF
THE
PRIESTS
WHOM
THEY
HAD
CARRIED
AWAY
FROM
SAMARIA
CAME
AND
DWELT
IN
BETHEL
AND
TAUGHT
THEM
HOW
THEY
SHOULD
FEAR
THE
LORD
HOWBEIT
EVERY
NATION
MADE
GODS
OF
THEIR
OWN
AND
PUT
THEM
IN
THE
HOUSES
OF
THE
HIGH
PLACES
WHICH
THE
SAMARITANS
HAD
MADE
EVERY
NATION
IN
THEIR
CITIES
WHEREIN
THEY
DWELT
AND
THE
MEN
OF
BABYLON
MADE
SUCCOTHBENOTH
AND
THE
MEN
OF
CUTH
MADE
NERGAL
AND
THE
MEN
OF
HAMATH
MADE
ASHIMA
AND
THE
AVITES
MADE
NIBHAZ
AND
TARTAK
AND
THE
SEPHARVITES
BURNT
THEIR
CHILDREN
IN
FIRE
TO
ADRAMMELECH
AND
ANAMMELECH
THE
GODS
OF
SEPHARVAIM
SO
THEY
FEARED
THE
LORD
AND
MADE
UNTO
THEMSELVES
OF
THE
LOWEST
OF
THEM
PRIESTS
OF
THE
HIGH
PLACES
WHICH
SACRIFICED
FOR

IN
THE

OF
THE

THEY
FEARED
THE

AND
SERVED
THEIR

GODS
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
NATIONS
WHOM
THEY
CARRIED
AWAY
FROM
THENCE
UNTO
THIS
DAY
THEY
DO
AFTER
THE
FORMER
MANNERS
THEY
FEAR
NOT
THE
LORD
NEITHER
DO
THEY
AFTER
THEIR
STATUTES
OR
AFTER
THEIR
ORDINANCES
OR
AFTER
THE
LAW
AND
COMMANDMENT
WHICH
THE

COMMANDED
THE
CHILDREN
OF

WHOM
HE
NAMED
ISRAEL
WITH
WHOM
THE

HAD
MADE
A
COVENANT
AND
CHARGED

SAYING
YE

NOT
FEAR
OTHER

HOWBEIT
THEY

AND
SERVED
THEIR

IMAGES
BOTH
THEIR

THAT
WHICH
WAS
EVIL
IN

OF
THE

AFTER
THE
ABOMINATIONS
OF
THE
HEATHEN
WHOM
THE

CAST

ALTARS
FOR

OBSERVED
TIMES
AND
USED
ENCHANTMENTS
AND
DEALT
WITH
FAMILIAR
SPIRITS
AND
WIZARDS
HE
WROUGHT
MUCH
WICKEDNESS
IN
THE

THEY
HEARKENED
NOT
AND
MANASSEH
SEDUCED
THEM
TO
DO
MORE
EVIL
THAN
DID
THE

WHOM
THE
LORD
DESTROYED
BEFORE
THE

DREW
NIGH
BEFORE
THE

UNTO

WERE
FLED
THEY
LIKEWISE
FLED
BEFORE

AND
CAME
UPON

BUT
THE

FLED

THEY
MADE
PEACE
WITH

BECAME
HIS

NEITHER
WOULD
THE
SYRIANS
HELP
THE
CHILDREN
OF

ANY

AND
JOAB
SMOTE
RABBAH
AND
DESTROYED
IT
AND
DAVID
TOOK
THE
CROWN
OF
THEIR
KING
FROM
OFF
HIS
HEAD
AND
FOUND
IT
TO
WEIGH
A
TALENT
OF
GOLD
AND
THERE
WERE
PRECIOUS
STONES
IN
IT
AND
IT
WAS
SET
UPON
DAVID'S
HEAD
AND
HE
BROUGHT
ALSO
EXCEEDING
MUCH
SPOIL
OUT

AND
HE
BROUGHT
OUT
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
IN
IT
AND
CUT
THEM
WITH
SAWS
AND
WITH
HARROWS
OF
IRON
AND
WITH

EVEN
SO
DEALT
DAVID
WITH
ALL
THE
CITIES
OF
THE

RETURNED

AND
ELHANAN
THE

SLEW
LAHMI
THE

THE

WHOSE
SPEAR
STAFF
WAS
LIKE

THERE

WHERE

DAVID'S

SLEW
HIM
THESE
WERE
BORN

AND
THEY
FELL
BY

AND
BY
THE
HAND
OF
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
SATAN
STOOD
UP
AGAINST

AND
PROVOKED
DAVID

JOAB
ANSWERED
THE

TIMES
SO
MANY
MORE
AS
THEY
BE
BUT
MY
LORD
THE

ARE
THEY
NOT
ALL
MY
LORD'S
SERVANTS
WHY
THEN
DOTH
MY

REQUIRE
THIS
THING
WHY
WILL
HE
BE
A
CAUSE
OF
TRESPASS
TO
ISRAEL
NEVERTHELESS
THE
KING'S
WORD
PREVAILED
AGAINST
JOAB
WHEREFORE
JOAB
DEPARTED
AND
WENT
THROUGHOUT
ALL
ISRAEL
AND
CAME
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
JOAB
GAVE
THE
SUM
OF
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE

UNTO
DAVID
AND
ALL
THEY
OF

WERE
A
THOUSAND
THOUSAND
AND
AN

MEN
THAT
DREW

AND
JUDAH
WAS
FOUR
HUNDRED
THREESCORE

THAT
DREW
SWORD
BUT
LEVI
AND
BENJAMIN
COUNTED
HE
NOT
AMONG
THEM
FOR
THE
KING'S
WORD
WAS
ABOMINABLE
TO
JOAB
AND
GOD
WAS
DISPLEASED
WITH
THIS
THING
THEREFORE
HE
SMOTE
ISRAEL
AND
DAVID
SAID
UNTO
GOD
I
HAVE
SINNED
GREATLY
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
DONE
THIS
THING
BUT
NOW
I
BESEECH
THEE
DO
AWAY
THE
INIQUITY
OF

FOR
I
HAVE

VERY
FOOLISHLY
AND
THE

SPAKE
UNTO
GAD
DAVID'S
SEER
SAYING
GO

TELL
DAVID
SAYING
THUS
SAITH
THE

I
OFFER
THEE
THREE

CHOOSE
THEE
ONE
OF

THAT
I
MAY

CAME

THUS
SAITH
THE

CHOOSE
THEE
EITHER
THREE
YEARS'
FAMINE

PESTILENCE
IN

AND
THE

DESTROYING
THROUGHOUT

HAND
OF
THE
LORD
FOR
VERY
GREAT
ARE
HIS
MERCIES
BUT
LET
ME
NOT
FALL
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
MAN
SO
THE
LORD
SENT
PESTILENCE
UPON
ISRAEL
AND
THERE
FELL
OF
ISRAEL
SEVENTY
THOUSAND
MEN
AND
GOD
SENT
AN
ANGEL
UNTO

TO

AND
AS

THE

THAT
DESTROYED
IT
IS

STAY

AND
DAVID
LIFTED
UP
HIS

SAW
THE

LORD
STAND
BETWEEN
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
HEAVEN
HAVING
A
DRAWN
SWORD
IN
HIS
HAND
STRETCHED
OUT
OVER
JERUSALEM
THEN
DAVID
AND
THE
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
WHO
WERE
CLOTHED
IN
SACKCLOTH
FELL
UPON
THEIR
FACES
AND
DAVID
SAID
UNTO
GOD
IS
IT
NOT
I
THAT
COMMANDED
THE
PEOPLE
TO
BE
NUMBERED
EVEN
I
IT
IS
THAT
HAVE
SINNED
AND
DONE
EVIL
INDEED
BUT
AS
FOR
THESE
SHEEP
WHAT
HAVE
THEY
DONE
LET
THINE
HAND
I
PRAY
THEE
O
LORD
MY
GOD
BE
ON
ME
AND
ON
MY
FATHER'S
HOUSE
BUT
NOT
ON
THY

THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
PLAGUED
THEN
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
COMMANDED
GAD
TO
SAY
TO
DAVID
THAT
DAVID
SHOULD
GO
UP
AND
SET
UP
AN
ALTAR
UNTO
THE
LORD
IN
THE
THRESHINGFLOOR
OF
ORNAN
THE
JEBUSITE
AND
DAVID
WENT
UP
AT
THE
SAYING
OF
GAD
WHICH
HE
SPAKE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
AND
ORNAN
TURNED
BACK
AND
SAW
THE
ANGEL
AND
HIS
FOUR
SONS
WITH

HID
THEMSELVES
NOW
ORNAN
WAS
THRESHING
WHEAT
AND
AS

CAME
TO
ORNAN
ORNAN
LOOKED
AND
SAW
DAVID
AND
WENT
OUT
OF
THE
THRESHINGFLOOR
AND
BOWED
HIMSELF
TO
DAVID
WITH
HIS
FACE
TO
THE
GROUND
THEN
DAVID
SAID
TO
ORNAN
GRANT
ME
THE
PLACE
OF
THIS
THRESHINGFLOOR
THAT
I
MAY
BUILD
AN
ALTAR
THEREIN
UNTO
THE
LORD
THOU
SHALT
GRANT
IT
ME
FOR
THE
FULL
PRICE
THAT
THE
PLAGUE
MAY
BE
STAYED
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
AND
ORNAN
SAID
UNTO
DAVID
TAKE
IT
TO
THEE
AND
LET
MY
LORD
THE
KING
DO
THAT
WHICH
IS
GOOD
IN

LO
I

PRICE
FOR
I
WILL
NOT
TAKE
THAT
WHICH

FOR

LORD
NOR
OFFER
BURNT
OFFERINGS
WITHOUT

SO
DAVID
GAVE
TO
ORNAN
FOR

PLACE
SIX
HUNDRED
SHEKELS
OF
GOLD
BY

AND
DAVID
BUILT
THERE
AN
ALTAR

OFFERING
AND
THE
LORD
COMMANDED
THE
ANGEL
AND
HE
PUT
UP
HIS

AGAIN
INTO
THE
SHEATH
THEREOF
AT
THAT
TIME
WHEN
DAVID
SAW
THAT
THE

HAD
ANSWERED
HIM
IN

THRESHINGFLOOR
OF
ORNAN
THE

THEN

OF
THE
LORD
GOD
AND
THIS
IS
THE
ALTAR
OF
THE

OFFERING
FOR

THE

WHEN

THE

MAY
BE
A

THAT

AND
WE

FOR

WITH
SOUNDING
TRUMPETS
TO

ALARM
AGAINST
YOU
O
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
FIGHT
YE
NOT
AGAINST
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
YOUR
FATHERS
FOR
YE
SHALL
NOT
PROSPER
BUT
JEROBOAM
CAUSED
AN
AMBUSHMENT
TO
COME
ABOUT
BEHIND
THEM
SO
THEY
WERE
BEFORE
JUDAH
AND
THE
AMBUSHMENT
WAS
BEHIND

AND
WHEN

BEHOLD
THE
BATTLE
WAS
BEFORE

BEHIND
AND
THEY
CRIED
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
THE
PRIESTS
SOUNDED
WITH

THEN
THE

GAVE
A
SHOUT
AND
AS
THE

SHOUTED
IT

THAT
GOD

SLAUGHTER
SO
THERE
FELL
DOWN

FIVE
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
CHOSEN
MEN
THUS
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
WERE
BROUGHT
UNDER
AT

AND
THE

THE
ACTS
OF

AND
HIS

ARE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
STORY
OF

AND
CARRIED

AGAIN
THUS
THEY
DID
DAY

AND
THE

AND
THEY
SET
THE

CONTINUALLY
ALL

JEHOIADA
WAXED

AND
WAS
FULL
OF
DAYS
WHEN
HE
DIED
AN
HUNDRED

THIRTY
YEARS
OLD
WAS
HE
WHEN
HE
DIED
AND
THEY
BURIED
HIM
IN
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
AMONG
THE
KINGS
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
DONE
GOOD
IN

BOTH
TOWARD

AND
TOWARD
HIS
HOUSE
NOW
AFTER
THE
DEATH
OF
JEHOIADA
CAME
THE
PRINCES
OF
JUDAH
AND
MADE
OBEISANCE
TO
THE

THEN
THE

HEARKENED
UNTO

AND
THEY
LEFT
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE

GOD
OF
THEIR

AND
SERVED
GROVES

IDOLS
AND
WRATH
CAME
UPON

FOR

THEIR

YET
HE
SENT

TO
THEM
TO
BRING
THEM
AGAIN
UNTO
THE

AND
THEY
TESTIFIED
AGAINST

BUT
THEY
WOULD
NOT
GIVE

AND
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
CAME
UPON
ZECHARIAH
THE
SON
OF
JEHOIADA
THE
PRIEST
WHICH
STOOD
ABOVE
THE
PEOPLE
AND
SAID
UNTO

THUS
SAITH
GOD
WHY
TRANSGRESS
YE
THE

OF

THAT
YE
CANNOT
PROSPER
BECAUSE
YE
HAVE
FORSAKEN
THE

HE
HATH
ALSO
FORSAKEN

AND
THEY
CONSPIRED
AGAINST

AND
STONED
HIM
WITH

AT
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
THE
KING
IN
THE
COURT
OF

THUS
JOASH
THE
KING
REMEMBERED
NOT
THE
KINDNESS
WHICH
JEHOIADA
HIS
FATHER
HAD
DONE
TO
HIM
BUT
SLEW
HIS
SON
AND
WHEN
HE
DIED
HE
SAID
THE
LORD
LOOK
UPON
IT
AND
REQUIRE
IT
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
THAT
THE
HOST
OF
SYRIA
CAME
UP
AGAINST

AND
THEY
CAME
TO
JUDAH
AND

THE
SYRIANS
CAME
WITH
A
SMALL
COMPANY
OF
MEN
AND
THE
LORD
DELIVERED
A
VERY
GREAT
HOST
INTO
THEIR
HAND
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
FORSAKEN
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
THEIR
FATHERS
SO
THEY
EXECUTED
JUDGMENT
AGAINST
JOASH
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DEPARTED
FROM
HIM
FOR
THEY
LEFT
HIM
IN
GREAT
DISEASES
HIS

SERVANTS
CONSPIRED
AGAINST

AND
THEY
SANG

AND
THEY

COME

AND
THANK
OFFERINGS
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE

AND
THE
CONGREGATION
BROUGHT
IN
SACRIFICES
AND
THANK
OFFERINGS
AND
AS
MANY
AS
WERE
OF
A
FREE
HEART
BURNT
OFFERINGS
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
BURNT
OFFERINGS
WHICH
THE
CONGREGATION
BROUGHT
WAS
THREESCORE
AND
TEN
BULLOCKS
AN
HUNDRED
RAMS
AND
TWO
HUNDRED
LAMBS
ALL
THESE
WERE
FOR
A
BURNT
OFFERING
TO
THE
LORD
AND
THE
CONSECRATED
THINGS
WERE
SIX
HUNDRED
OXEN
AND
THREE
THOUSAND
SHEEP
BUT
THE
PRIESTS
WERE
TOO
FEW
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
FLAY
ALL
THE
BURNT
OFFERINGS
WHEREFORE
THEIR
BRETHREN
THE
LEVITES
DID
HELP
THEM
TILL
THE
WORK
WAS
ENDED
AND
UNTIL
THE
OTHER
PRIESTS
HAD
SANCTIFIED
THEMSELVES
FOR
THE
LEVITES
WERE
MORE
UPRIGHT
IN
HEART
TO
SANCTIFY
THEMSELVES
THAN
THE
PRIESTS
AND
ALSO
THE
BURNT
OFFERINGS
WERE
IN
ABUNDANCE
WITH
THE
FAT
OF
THE
PEACE
OFFERINGS
AND
THE
DRINK
OFFERINGS
FOR
EVERY
BURNT
OFFERING
SO
THE
SERVICE
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
SET
IN
ORDER
AND
HEZEKIAH
REJOICED
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
GOD
HAD
PREPARED
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
THE
THING
WAS
DONE
SUDDENLY
AND
HEZEKIAH
SENT
TO
ALL
ISRAEL
AND
JUDAH
AND
WROTE
LETTERS
ALSO
TO
EPHRAIM
AND
MANASSEH
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
COME
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AT
JERUSALEM
TO
KEEP
THE
PASSOVER
UNTO
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
THE
KING
HAD
TAKEN
COUNSEL
AND
HIS
PRINCES
AND
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
IN
JERUSALEM
TO
KEEP
THE
PASSOVER
IN
THE
SECOND
MONTH
FOR
THEY
COULD
NOT
KEEP
IT
AT
THAT
TIME
BECAUSE
THE
PRIESTS
HAD
NOT
SANCTIFIED
THEMSELVES
SUFFICIENTLY
NEITHER
HAD
THE
PEOPLE
GATHERED
THEMSELVES
TOGETHER
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THE
THING
PLEASED
THE
KING
AND
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
SO
THEY
ESTABLISHED
A
DECREE
TO
MAKE
PROCLAMATION
THROUGHOUT
ALL
ISRAEL
FROM
BEERSHEBA
EVEN
TO
DAN
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
COME
TO
KEEP
THE
PASSOVER
UNTO
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
AT
JERUSALEM
FOR
THEY
HAD
NOT
DONE
IT
OF
A
LONG
TIME
IN
SUCH
SORT
AS
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
SO
THE
POSTS
WENT
WITH
THE
LETTERS
FROM
THE

THE
AMBASSADORS
OF
THE
PRINCES
OF
BABYLON
WHO
SENT
UNTO
HIM
TO
ENQUIRE
OF
THE
WONDER
THAT
WAS
DONE
IN
THE
LAND
GOD
LEFT
HIM
TO
TRY
HIM
THAT
HE
MIGHT
KNOW
ALL
THAT
WAS
IN
HIS
HEART
NOW
THE
REST
OF
THE
ACTS
OF
HEZEKIAH
AND
HIS
GOODNESS
BEHOLD
THEY
ARE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
VISION
OF
ISAIAH
THE
PROPHET
THE
SON
OF
AMOZ
AND
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
KINGS
OF
JUDAH
AND
ISRAEL
AND
HEZEKIAH
SLEPT
WITH
HIS
FATHERS
AND
THEY
BURIED
HIM
IN
THE
CHIEFEST
OF
THE
SEPULCHRES
OF
THE
SONS
OF
DAVID
AND
ALL
JUDAH
AND
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
JERUSALEM
DID
HIM
HONOUR
AT
HIS
DEATH
AND
MANASSEH
HIS
SON
REIGNED
IN
HIS
STEAD
MANASSEH
WAS
TWELVE
YEARS
OLD
WHEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
REIGN
AND
HE
REIGNED
FIFTY
AND
FIVE
YEARS
IN
JERUSALEM
BUT
DID
THAT
WHICH
WAS
EVIL
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
LIKE
UNTO
THE
ABOMINATIONS
OF
THE
HEATHEN
WHOM
THE
LORD
HAD
CAST
OUT
BEFORE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
HE
BUILT
AGAIN
THE
HIGH
PLACES
WHICH
HEZEKIAH
HIS
FATHER
HAD
BROKEN
DOWN
AND
HE
REARED
UP
ALTARS
FOR
BAALIM
AND
MADE
GROVES
AND
WORSHIPPED
ALL
THE
HOST
OF
HEAVEN
AND
SERVED
THEM
ALSO
HE
BUILT
ALTARS
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
WHEREOF
THE
LORD
HAD
SAID
IN
JERUSALEM
SHALL
MY
NAME
BE
FOR
EVER
AND
HE
BUILT
ALTARS
FOR
ALL
THE
HOST
OF
HEAVEN
IN
THE
TWO
COURTS
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
HE
CAUSED
HIS
CHILDREN
TO
PASS
THROUGH
THE
FIRE
IN
THE
VALLEY
OF
THE
SON
OF
HINNOM
ALSO
HE
OBSERVED
TIMES
AND
USED
ENCHANTMENTS
AND
USED
WITCHCRAFT
AND
DEALT
WITH
A
FAMILIAR
SPIRIT
AND
WITH
WIZARDS
HE
WROUGHT
MUCH
EVIL
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
TO
PROVOKE
HIM
TO
ANGER
AND
HE
SET
A
CARVED
IMAGE
THE
IDOL
WHICH
HE
HAD
MADE
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
OF
WHICH
GOD
HAD
SAID
TO
DAVID
AND
TO
SOLOMON
HIS
SON
IN
THIS
HOUSE
AND
IN
JERUSALEM
WHICH
I
HAVE
CHOSEN
BEFORE
ALL
THE
TRIBES
OF
ISRAEL
WILL
I
PUT
MY
NAME
FOR
EVER
NEITHER
WILL
I
ANY
MORE
REMOVE
THE
FOOT
OF
ISRAEL
FROM
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
WHICH
I
HAVE
APPOINTED
FOR
YOUR
FATHERS
SO
THAT
THEY
WILL
TAKE
HEED
TO
DO
ALL
THAT
I
HAVE
COMMANDED
THEM
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WHOLE
LAW
AND
THE
STATUTES
AND
THE
ORDINANCES
BY
THE
HAND
OF
MOSES
SO
MANASSEH
MADE
JUDAH
AND
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
JERUSALEM
TO
ERR
AND
TO
DO
WORSE
THAN
THE
HEATHEN
WHOM
THE
LORD
HAD
DESTROYED
BEFORE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
THE
LORD
SPAKE
TO
MANASSEH
AND
TO
HIS
PEOPLE
BUT
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HEARKEN
WHEREFORE
THE
LORD
BROUGHT
UPON
THEM
THE
CAPTAINS
OF
THE
HOST
OF
THE
KING
OF
ASSYRIA
WHICH
TOOK
MANASSEH
AMONG
THE
THORNS
AND
BOUND
HIM
WITH
FETTERS
AND
CARRIED
HIM
TO
BABYLON
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
IN
AFFLICTION
HE
BESOUGHT
THE
LORD
HIS
GOD
AND
HUMBLED
HIMSELF
GREATLY
BEFORE
THE
GOD
OF
HIS
FATHERS
AND
PRAYED
UNTO
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
INTREATED
OF
HIM
AND
HEARD
HIS
SUPPLICATION
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
AGAIN
TO
JERUSALEM
INTO
HIS
KINGDOM
THEN
MANASSEH
KNEW
THAT
THE
LORD
HE
WAS
GOD
NOW
AFTER
THIS
HE
BUILT
A
WALL
WITHOUT
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
ON
THE
WEST
SIDE
OF
GIHON
IN
THE
VALLEY
EVEN
TO
THE
ENTERING
IN
AT
THE
FISH
GATE
AND
COMPASSED
ABOUT
OPHEL
AND
RAISED
IT
UP
A
VERY
GREAT
HEIGHT
AND
PUT
CAPTAINS
OF
WAR
IN
ALL
THE
FENCED
CITIES
OF
JUDAH
AND
HE
TOOK
AWAY
THE
STRANGE
GODS
AND
THE
IDOL
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
ALL
THE
ALTARS
THAT
HE
HAD
BUILT
IN
THE
MOUNT
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
CAST
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AND
HE
REPAIRED
THE
ALTAR
OF
THE
LORD
AND
SACRIFICED
THEREON
PEACE
OFFERINGS
AND
THANK
OFFERINGS
AND
COMMANDED
JUDAH
TO
SERVE
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
NEVERTHELESS
THE
PEOPLE
DID
SACRIFICE
STILL
IN
THE
HIGH
PLACES
YET
UNTO
THE
LORD
THEIR
GOD
ONLY
NOW
THE
REST
OF
THE
ACTS
OF
MANASSEH
AND
HIS
PRAYER
UNTO
HIS
GOD
AND
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
SEERS
THAT
SPAKE
TO
HIM
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
BEHOLD
THEY
ARE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
KINGS
OF
ISRAEL
HIS
PRAYER
ALSO
AND
HOW
GOD
WAS
INTREATED
OF
HIM
AND
ALL
HIS
SINS
AND
HIS
TRESPASS
AND
THE
PLACES
WHEREIN
HE
BUILT
HIGH
PLACES
AND
SET
UP
GROVES
AND
GRAVEN
IMAGES
BEFORE
HE
WAS
HUMBLED
BEHOLD
THEY
ARE
WRITTEN
AMONG
THE
SAYINGS
OF
THE
SEERS
SO
MANASSEH
SLEPT
WITH
HIS
FATHERS
AND
THEY
BURIED
HIM
IN
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
AND
AMON
HIS
SON
REIGNED
IN
HIS
STEAD
AMON
WAS
TWO
AND
TWENTY
YEARS
OLD
WHEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
REIGN
AND
REIGNED
TWO
YEARS
IN
JERUSALEM
BUT
HE
DID
THAT
WHICH
WAS
EVIL
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
AS
DID
MANASSEH
HIS
FATHER
FOR
AMON
SACRIFICED
UNTO
ALL
THE
CARVED
IMAGES
WHICH
MANASSEH
HIS
FATHER
HAD
MADE
AND
SERVED
THEM
AND
HUMBLED
NOT
HIMSELF
BEFORE
THE
LORD
AS
MANASSEH
HIS
FATHER
HAD
HUMBLED
HIMSELF
BUT
AMON
TRESPASSED
MORE
AND
MORE
AND
HIS
SERVANTS
CONSPIRED
AGAINST
HIM
AND
SLEW
HIM
IN
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
BUT
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
LAND
SLEW
ALL
THEM
THAT
HAD
CONSPIRED
AGAINST
KING
AMON
AND
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
LAND
MADE
JOSIAH
HIS
SON
KING
IN
HIS
STEAD
JOSIAH
WAS
EIGHT
YEARS
OLD
WHEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
REIGN
AND
HE
REIGNED
IN
JERUSALEM
ONE
AND
THIRTY
YEARS
AND
HE
DID
THAT
WHICH
WAS
RIGHT
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
AND
WALKED
IN
THE
WAYS
OF
DAVID
HIS
FATHER
AND
DECLINED
NEITHER
TO
THE
RIGHT
HAND
NOR
TO
THE
LEFT
FOR
IN
THE
EIGHTH
YEAR
OF
HIS
REIGN
WHILE
HE
WAS
YET
YOUNG
HE
BEGAN
TO
SEEK
AFTER
THE
GOD
OF
DAVID
HIS
FATHER
AND
IN
THE
TWELFTH
YEAR
HE
BEGAN
TO
PURGE
JUDAH
AND
JERUSALEM
FROM
THE
HIGH
PLACES
AND
THE
GROVES
AND
THE
CARVED
IMAGES
AND
THE
MOLTEN
IMAGES
AND
THEY
BRAKE
DOWN
THE
ALTARS
OF
BAALIM
IN
HIS
PRESENCE
AND
THE
IMAGES
THAT
WERE
ON
HIGH
ABOVE
THEM
HE
CUT
DOWN
AND
THE
GROVES
AND
THE
CARVED
IMAGES
AND
THE
MOLTEN
IMAGES
HE
BRAKE
IN
PIECES
AND
MADE
DUST
OF
THEM
AND
STROWED
IT
UPON
THE
GRAVES
OF
THEM
THAT
HAD
SACRIFICED
UNTO
THEM
AND
HE
BURNT
THE
BONES
OF
THE
PRIESTS
UPON
THEIR
ALTARS
AND
CLEANSED
JUDAH
AND
JERUSALEM
AND
SO
DID
HE
IN
THE
CITIES
OF
MANASSEH
AND
EPHRAIM
AND
SIMEON
EVEN
UNTO
NAPHTALI
WITH
THEIR
MATTOCKS
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
BROKEN
DOWN
THE
ALTARS
AND
THE
GROVES
AND
HAD
BEATEN
THE
GRAVEN
IMAGES
INTO
POWDER
AND
CUT
DOWN
ALL
THE
IDOLS
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
ISRAEL
HE
RETURNED
TO
JERUSALEM
NOW
IN
THE
EIGHTEENTH
YEAR
OF
HIS
REIGN
WHEN
HE
HAD
PURGED
THE
LAND
AND
THE

HE
SENT

AND
MAASEIAH

AND
JOAH
THE
SON
OF

AND
WHEN
THEY

THE
HIGH

THEY
DELIVERED
THE
MONEY
THAT
WAS
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
WHICH
THE
LEVITES
THAT

AND
THEY
RETURNED

AND
THEY
PUT
IT
IN
THE
HAND
OF
THE
WORKMEN
THAT
HAD
THE
OVERSIGHT
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
THEY
GAVE
IT
TO
THE
WORKMEN
THAT
WROUGHT
IN
THE

OF
THE

TO
REPAIR
AND
AMEND
THE

EVEN

UNTO
ME
EVERY
ONE
THAT

AT
THE
WORDS
OF
THE

BECAUSE
OF
THE
TRANSGRESSION
OF
THOSE
THAT
HAD
BEEN
CARRIED
AWAY
AND
I
SAT
ASTONIED
UNTIL
THE
EVENING
SACRIFICE
AND
AT
THE
EVENING
SACRIFICE
I
AROSE
UP
FROM
MY
HEAVINESS
AND
HAVING
RENT
MY
GARMENT
AND
MY
MANTLE
I
FELL
UPON
MY
KNEES
AND
SPREAD
OUT
MY
HANDS
UNTO
THE
LORD
MY
GOD
AND
SAID
O
MY
GOD
I
AM
ASHAMED
AND
BLUSH
TO
LIFT
UP
MY
FACE
TO
THEE
MY
GOD
FOR
OUR
INIQUITIES
ARE
INCREASED
OVER
OUR
HEAD
AND
OUR
TRESPASS
IS
GROWN
UP
UNTO
THE
HEAVENS
SINCE
THE
DAYS
OF
OUR
FATHERS
HAVE
WE
BEEN
IN
A
GREAT
TRESPASS
UNTO
THIS
DAY
AND
FOR
OUR
INIQUITIES
HAVE
WE
OUR
KINGS
AND
OUR
PRIESTS
BEEN
DELIVERED
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
THE
KINGS
OF
THE
LANDS
TO
THE
SWORD
TO
CAPTIVITY
AND
TO
A
SPOIL
AND
TO
CONFUSION
OF
FACE
AS
IT
IS
THIS
DAY
AND
NOW
FOR
A
LITTLE
SPACE
GRACE
HATH
BEEN
SHEWED
FROM
THE
LORD
OUR
GOD
TO
LEAVE
US
A
REMNANT
TO
ESCAPE
AND
TO
GIVE
US
A
NAIL
IN
HIS
HOLY
PLACE
THAT
OUR
GOD
MAY
LIGHTEN
OUR
EYES
AND
GIVE
US
A
LITTLE
REVIVING
IN
OUR
BONDAGE
FOR
WE
WERE
BONDMEN
YET
OUR
GOD
HATH
NOT
FORSAKEN
US
IN
OUR
BONDAGE
BUT
HATH
EXTENDED
MERCY
UNTO
US
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
KINGS
OF
PERSIA
TO
GIVE
US
A
REVIVING
TO
SET
UP
THE
HOUSE
OF
OUR
GOD
AND
TO
REPAIR
THE
DESOLATIONS
THEREOF
AND
TO
GIVE
US
A
WALL
IN
JUDAH
AND
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
NOW
O
OUR
GOD
WHAT
SHALL
WE
SAY
AFTER
THIS
FOR
WE
HAVE
FORSAKEN
THY
COMMANDMENTS
WHICH
THOU
HAST
COMMANDED
BY

SERVANTS
THE

SAYING
THE
LAND
UNTO
WHICH

IT
IS
AN
UNCLEAN
LAND
WITH
THE
FILTHINESS
OF
THE

OF
THE

WITH
THEIR

FILLED
IT
FROM

THEIR
DAUGHTERS
UNTO

OR

BE
STRONG
AND
EAT
THE
GOOD
OF
THE

AND
LEAVE
IT
FOR
AN
INHERITANCE
TO
YOUR
CHILDREN
FOR
EVER
AND
AFTER
ALL
THAT
IS
COME
UPON
US
FOR
OUR
EVIL
DEEDS
AND
FOR
OUR
GREAT
TRESPASS
SEEING
THAT
THOU
OUR
GOD
HAST
PUNISHED
US
LESS
THAN
OUR
INIQUITIES
DESERVE
AND
HAST
GIVEN
US
SUCH
DELIVERANCE
AS
THIS
SHOULD
WE
AGAIN
BREAK
THY
COMMANDMENTS
AND
JOIN
IN
AFFINITY
WITH
THE

ABOMINATIONS
WOULDEST
NOT

AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE
MONTH
NISAN
IN
THE
TWENTIETH
YEAR
OF
ARTAXERXES
THE
KING
THAT
WINE
WAS
BEFORE
HIM
AND
I
TOOK
UP
THE
WINE
AND
GAVE
IT
UNTO
THE
KING
NOW
I
HAD
NOT
BEEN
BEFORETIME
SAD
IN
HIS
PRESENCE
WHEREFORE
THE
KING
SAID
UNTO
ME
WHY
IS
THY
COUNTENANCE
SAD
SEEING
THOU
ART
NOT
SICK
THIS
IS
NOTHING
ELSE
BUT
SORROW
OF
HEART
THEN
I
WAS
VERY
SORE
AFRAID
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
KING
LET
THE
KING
LIVE
FOR
EVER
WHY
SHOULD
NOT
MY
COUNTENANCE
BE
SAD
WHEN
THE
CITY
THE
PLACE
OF
MY
FATHERS'
SEPULCHRES
LIETH
WASTE
AND
THE
GATES
THEREOF
ARE
CONSUMED
WITH
FIRE
THEN
THE
KING
SAID
UNTO
ME
FOR
WHAT
DOST
THOU
MAKE
REQUEST
SO
I
PRAYED
TO
THE
GOD
OF
HEAVEN
AND
I
SAID
UNTO
THE
KING
IF
IT
PLEASE
THE
KING
AND
IF
THY
SERVANT
HAVE
FOUND
FAVOUR
IN
THY
SIGHT
THAT
THOU
WOULDEST
SEND
ME
UNTO
JUDAH
UNTO
THE
CITY
OF
MY
FATHERS'
SEPULCHRES
THAT
I
MAY
BUILD
IT
AND
THE
KING
SAID
UNTO
ME
THE
QUEEN
ALSO
SITTING
BY
HIM
FOR
HOW
LONG
SHALL
THY
JOURNEY
BE
AND
WHEN
WILT
THOU
RETURN
SO
IT
PLEASED
THE
KING
TO
SEND
ME
AND
I
SET
HIM
A
TIME
MOREOVER
I
SAID
UNTO
THE
KING
IF
IT
PLEASE
THE
KING
LET
LETTERS
BE
GIVEN
ME
TO
THE
GOVERNORS
BEYOND
THE
RIVER
THAT
THEY
MAY
CONVEY
ME
OVER
TILL
I
COME
INTO
JUDAH
AND
A
LETTER
UNTO
ASAPH
THE
KEEPER
OF
THE
KING'S
FOREST
THAT
HE
MAY
GIVE
ME
TIMBER
TO
MAKE
BEAMS
FOR
THE
GATES
OF
THE
PALACE
WHICH
APPERTAINED
TO
THE
HOUSE
AND
FOR
THE
WALL
OF
THE
CITY
AND
FOR
THE
HOUSE
THAT
I
SHALL
ENTER
INTO
AND
THE
KING
GRANTED
ME
ACCORDING
TO
THE
GOOD
HAND
OF
MY
GOD
UPON
ME
THEN
I
CAME
TO
THE
GOVERNORS
BEYOND
THE
RIVER
AND
GAVE
THEM
THE
KING'S
LETTERS
NOW
THE
KING
HAD
SENT
CAPTAINS
OF
THE
ARMY
AND
HORSEMEN
WITH
ME
WHEN
SANBALLAT
THE
HORONITE
AND
TOBIAH
THE
SERVANT
THE
AMMONITE
HEARD
OF
IT
IT
GRIEVED
THEM
EXCEEDINGLY
THAT
THERE
WAS
COME
A
MAN
TO
SEEK
THE
WELFARE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
SO
I
CAME
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
WAS
THERE
THREE
DAYS
AND
I
AROSE
IN
THE
NIGHT
I
AND
SOME
FEW
MEN
WITH
ME
NEITHER
TOLD
I
ANY
MAN
WHAT
MY
GOD
HAD
PUT
IN
MY
HEART
TO
DO
AT
JERUSALEM
NEITHER
WAS
THERE
ANY
BEAST
WITH
ME
SAVE
THE
BEAST
THAT
I
RODE
UPON
AND
I
WENT
OUT
BY
NIGHT
BY
THE
GATE
OF
THE
VALLEY
EVEN
BEFORE
THE
DRAGON
WELL
AND
TO
THE
DUNG
PORT
AND
VIEWED
THE
WALLS
OF
JERUSALEM
WHICH
WERE
BROKEN
DOWN
AND
THE
GATES
THEREOF
WERE
CONSUMED
WITH
FIRE
THEN
I
WENT
ON
TO
THE
GATE
OF
THE
FOUNTAIN
AND
TO
THE
KING'S
POOL
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
PLACE
FOR
THE
BEAST
THAT
WAS
UNDER
ME
TO
PASS
THEN
WENT
I
UP
IN
THE
NIGHT
BY
THE
BROOK
AND
VIEWED
THE
WALL
AND
TURNED
BACK
AND
ENTERED
BY
THE
GATE
OF
THE
VALLEY
AND
SO
RETURNED
AND
THE
RULERS
KNEW
NOT
WHITHER
I
WENT
OR
WHAT
I
DID
NEITHER
HAD
I
AS
YET
TOLD
IT
TO
THE
JEWS
NOR
TO
THE
PRIESTS
NOR
TO
THE
NOBLES
NOR
TO
THE
RULERS
NOR
TO
THE
REST
THAT
DID
THE
WORK
THEN
SAID
I
UNTO
THEM
YE
SEE
THE
DISTRESS
THAT
WE
ARE
IN
HOW
JERUSALEM
LIETH
WASTE
AND
THE
GATES
THEREOF
ARE
BURNED
WITH
FIRE
COME
AND
LET
US
BUILD
UP
THE
WALL
OF
JERUSALEM
THAT
WE
BE
NO
MORE
A
REPROACH
THEN
I
TOLD
THEM
OF
THE
HAND
OF
MY
GOD
WHICH
WAS
GOOD
UPON
ME
AS
ALSO
THE
KING'S
WORDS
THAT
HE
HAD
SPOKEN
UNTO
ME
AND
THEY
SAID
LET
US
RISE
UP
AND

WAS

FOR

HAD
A

TO

IT
CAME
TO

THAT
WHEN
SANBALLAT
AND
TOBIAH
AND
THE
ARABIANS
AND
THE
AMMONITES
AND
THE
ASHDODITES
HEARD
THAT
THE
WALLS
OF

THAT
THE

BEGAN
TO

THEN
THEY
WERE
VERY
WROTH
AND
CONSPIRED
ALL
OF
THEM
TOGETHER
TO
COME
AND
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
JERUSALEM
AND
TO
HINDER
IT
NEVERTHELESS
WE
MADE
OUR
PRAYER
UNTO
OUR
GOD
AND
SET
A
WATCH
AGAINST
THEM
DAY
AND
NIGHT
BECAUSE
OF
THEM
AND
JUDAH
SAID
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
BEARERS
OF
BURDENS
IS
DECAYED
AND
THERE
IS
MUCH
RUBBISH
SO
THAT
WE
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
BUILD
THE
WALL
AND
OUR
ADVERSARIES
SAID
THEY
SHALL
NOT
KNOW
NEITHER
SEE
TILL
WE
COME
IN
THE
MIDST
AMONG

AND
SLAY
THEM
AND
CAUSE
THE
WORK
TO

AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
THE
JEWS
WHICH
DWELT
BY

CAME
THEY
SAID
UNTO
US
TEN
TIMES
FROM
ALL
PLACES
WHENCE
YE
SHALL
RETURN
UNTO
US
THEY
WILL
BE
UPON
YOU
THEREFORE
SET
I
IN
THE
LOWER
PLACES
BEHIND
THE
WALL
AND
ON
THE
HIGHER
PLACES
I
EVEN
SET
THE
PEOPLE
AFTER
THEIR
FAMILIES
WITH
THEIR
SWORDS
THEIR
SPEARS
AND
THEIR
BOWS
AND
I
LOOKED
AND
ROSE
UP
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
NOBLES
AND
TO
THE
RULERS
AND
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BE
NOT
YE
AFRAID
OF
THEM
REMEMBER
THE
LORD
WHICH
IS
GREAT
AND
TERRIBLE
AND
FIGHT
FOR
YOUR
BRETHREN
YOUR
SONS
AND
YOUR
DAUGHTERS
YOUR
WIVES
AND
YOUR
HOUSES
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
OUR
ENEMIES
HEARD
THAT
IT
WAS
KNOWN
UNTO
US
AND
GOD
HAD
BROUGHT
THEIR
COUNSEL
TO
NOUGHT
THAT
WE
RETURNED
ALL
OF
US
TO
THE
WALL
EVERY
ONE
UNTO
HIS
WORK
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
FROM
THAT
TIME
FORTH
THAT
THE
HALF
OF
MY
SERVANTS
WROUGHT
IN
THE
WORK
AND
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
THEM
HELD
BOTH
THE
SPEARS
THE
SHIELDS
AND
THE
BOWS
AND
THE
HABERGEONS
AND
THE
RULERS
WERE
BEHIND
ALL
THE
HOUSE
OF
JUDAH
THEY
WHICH
BUILDED
ON
THE
WALL
AND
THEY
THAT
BARE
BURDENS
WITH
THOSE
THAT
LADED
EVERY
ONE
WITH
ONE
OF
HIS
HANDS
WROUGHT
IN
THE
WORK
AND
WITH
THE
OTHER
HAND
HELD
A
WEAPON
FOR
THE
BUILDERS
EVERY
ONE
HAD
HIS
SWORD
GIRDED
BY
HIS
SIDE
AND
SO
BUILDED
AND
HE
THAT
SOUNDED
THE
TRUMPET
WAS
BY
ME
AND
I
SAID
UNTO
THE
NOBLES
AND
TO
THE
RULERS
AND
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THE
WORK
IS
GREAT
AND
LARGE
AND
WE
ARE
SEPARATED
UPON
THE
WALL
ONE
FAR
FROM
ANOTHER
IN
WHAT
PLACE
THEREFORE
YE
HEAR
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
TRUMPET
RESORT
YE
THITHER
UNTO
US
OUR
GOD
SHALL
FIGHT
FOR
US
SO
WE
LABOURED
IN
THE
WORK
AND
HALF
OF
THEM
HELD
THE
SPEARS
FROM
THE
RISING
OF
THE
MORNING
TILL
THE
STARS
APPEARED
LIKEWISE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
SAID
I
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
LET
EVERY
ONE
WITH
HIS
SERVANT
LODGE
WITHIN
JERUSALEM
THAT
IN
THE
NIGHT
THEY
MAY
BE
A
GUARD
TO
US
AND
LABOUR
ON
THE
DAY
SO
NEITHER
I
NOR
MY
BRETHREN
NOR
MY
SERVANTS
NOR
THE
MEN
OF
THE
GUARD
WHICH
FOLLOWED
ME
NONE
OF
US
PUT
OFF
OUR
CLOTHES
SAVING
THAT
EVERY
ONE
PUT
THEM
OFF
FOR
WASHING
AND
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
CRY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
OF
THEIR
WIVES
AGAINST
THEIR
BRETHREN
THE
JEWS
FOR
THERE
WERE
THAT
SAID
WE
OUR
SONS
AND
OUR
DAUGHTERS
ARE
MANY
THEREFORE
WE
TAKE
UP
CORN
FOR
THEM
THAT
WE
MAY
EAT
AND
LIVE
SOME
ALSO
THERE
WERE
THAT
SAID
WE
HAVE
MORTGAGED
OUR
LANDS
VINEYARDS
AND
HOUSES
THAT
WE
MIGHT
BUY
CORN
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DEARTH
THERE
WERE
ALSO
THAT
SAID
WE
HAVE
BORROWED
MONEY
FOR
THE
KING'S
TRIBUTE
AND
THAT
UPON
OUR
LANDS
AND
VINEYARDS
YET
NOW
OUR
FLESH
IS
AS
THE
FLESH
OF
OUR
BRETHREN
OUR
CHILDREN
AS
THEIR
CHILDREN
AND
LO
WE
BRING
INTO
BONDAGE
OUR
SONS
AND
OUR
DAUGHTERS
TO
BE
SERVANTS
AND
SOME
OF
OUR
DAUGHTERS
ARE
BROUGHT
UNTO
BONDAGE
ALREADY
NEITHER
IS
IT
IN
OUR
POWER
TO
REDEEM
THEM
FOR
OTHER
MEN
HAVE
OUR
LANDS
AND
VINEYARDS
AND
I
WAS
VERY
ANGRY
WHEN
I
HEARD
THEIR
CRY
AND
THESE
WORDS
THEN
I
CONSULTED
WITH
MYSELF
AND
I
REBUKED
THE
NOBLES
AND
THE
RULERS
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
EXACT
USURY
EVERY
ONE
OF
HIS
BROTHER
AND
I
SET
A
GREAT
ASSEMBLY
AGAINST
THEM
AND
I
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WE
AFTER
OUR
ABILITY
HAVE
REDEEMED
OUR
BRETHREN
THE
JEWS
WHICH
WERE
SOLD
UNTO
THE
HEATHEN
AND
WILL
YE
EVEN
SELL
YOUR
BRETHREN
OR
SHALL
THEY
BE
SOLD
UNTO
US
THEN
HELD
THEY
THEIR
PEACE
AND
FOUND
NOTHING
TO
ANSWER
ALSO
I
SAID
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
THAT
YE
DO
OUGHT
YE
NOT
TO
WALK
IN
THE
FEAR
OF
OUR
GOD
BECAUSE
OF
THE
REPROACH
OF
THE
HEATHEN
OUR
ENEMIES
I
LIKEWISE
AND
MY
BRETHREN
AND
MY
SERVANTS
MIGHT
EXACT
OF
THEM
MONEY
AND
CORN
I
PRAY
YOU
LET
US
LEAVE
OFF
THIS
USURY
RESTORE
I
PRAY
YOU
TO
THEM
EVEN
THIS
DAY
THEIR
LANDS
THEIR
VINEYARDS
THEIR
OLIVEYARDS
AND
THEIR
HOUSES
ALSO
THE
HUNDREDTH
PART
OF
THE
MONEY
AND
OF
THE
CORN
THE
WINE
AND
THE
OIL
THAT
YE
EXACT
OF
THEM
THEN
SAID
THEY
WE
WILL
RESTORE
THEM
AND
WILL
REQUIRE
NOTHING
OF
THEM
SO
WILL
WE
DO
AS
THOU
SAYEST
THEN
I
CALLED
THE
PRIESTS
AND
TOOK
AN
OATH
OF
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
DO
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
PROMISE
ALSO
I
SHOOK
MY
LAP
AND
SAID
SO
GOD
SHAKE
OUT
EVERY
MAN
FROM
HIS
HOUSE
AND
FROM

LABOUR
THAT
PERFORMETH

DID
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
PROMISE
MOREOVER
FROM
THE
TIME
THAT
I
WAS
APPOINTED
TO
BE
THEIR

IN
THE

THE
KING
THAT
IS
TWELVE
YEARS
I
AND
MY
BRETHREN
HAVE
NOT
EATEN
THE
BREAD
OF
THE

BUT
THE
FORMER

THAT

WERE
CHARGEABLE
UNTO

AND
HAD
TAKEN
OF
THEM
BREAD
AND

DID
NOT
I
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FEAR
OF

YEA
ALSO
I
CONTINUED
IN
THE
WORK
OF

NEITHER
BOUGHT
WE
ANY
LAND
AND
ALL
MY
SERVANTS
WERE
GATHERED
THITHER
UNTO
THE

MOREOVER
THERE
WERE
AT

AN

AND
FIFTY
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
RULERS
BESIDE
THOSE
THAT
CAME
UNTO
US
FROM
AMONG
THE

OX
AND
SIX
CHOICE
SHEEP
ALSO
FOWLS
WERE
PREPARED
FOR

AND
ONCE
IN
TEN
DAYS
STORE
OF
ALL
SORTS
OF

YET
FOR
ALL
THIS
REQUIRED
NOT

THE
BREAD
OF
THE

WAS
HEAVY
UPON
THIS

THINK
UPON
ME
MY
GOD
FOR
GOOD
ACCORDING
TO
ALL
THAT
I
HAVE
DONE
FOR

TOGETHER
IN
SOME

OF

MISCHIEF
AND
I
SENT
MESSENGERS
UNTO

SAYING

A
GREAT
WORK
SO
THAT
I
CANNOT
COME
DOWN
WHY
SHOULD
THE

MANNER
THE

WITH

IN

WHEREIN
WAS
WRITTEN
IT
IS
REPORTED
AMONG
THE
HEATHEN
AND
GASHMU
SAITH
IT
THAT
THOU
AND
THE
JEWS
THINK
TO
REBEL
FOR
WHICH
CAUSE
THOU
BUILDEST
THE
WALL
THAT
THOU
MAYEST
BE
THEIR
KING
ACCORDING
TO
THESE
WORDS
AND
THOU
HAST
ALSO
APPOINTED
PROPHETS
TO
PREACH
OF
THEE
AT
JERUSALEM
SAYING
THERE
IS
A
KING
IN
JUDAH
AND
NOW
SHALL
IT
BE
REPORTED
TO
THE
KING
ACCORDING
TO
THESE
WORDS
COME
NOW
THEREFORE
AND
LET
US
TAKE
COUNSEL
TOGETHER
THEN
I
SENT
UNTO
HIM
SAYING
THERE
ARE
NO
SUCH
THINGS
DONE
AS
THOU
SAYEST
BUT
THOU
FEIGNEST
THEM
OUT
OF
THINE
OWN
HEART
FOR
THEY
ALL
MADE
US
AFRAID
SAYING
THEIR
HANDS
SHALL
BE
WEAKENED
FROM
THE
WORK
THAT
IT
BE
NOT
DONE
NOW
THEREFORE
O
GOD
STRENGTHEN
MY
HANDS
AFTERWARD
I
CAME
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
SHEMAIAH
THE
SON
OF
DELAIAH
THE
SON
OF
MEHETABEEL
WHO
WAS
SHUT
UP
AND
HE
SAID
LET
US
MEET
TOGETHER
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
WITHIN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
LET
US
SHUT
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
TEMPLE
FOR
THEY
WILL
COME
TO
SLAY
THEE
YEA
IN
THE
NIGHT
WILL
THEY
COME
TO
SLAY
THEE
AND
I
SAID
SHOULD
SUCH
A
MAN
AS
I
FLEE
AND
WHO
IS
THERE
THAT
BEING
AS
I
AM
WOULD
GO
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
TO
SAVE
HIS
LIFE
I
WILL
NOT
GO
IN
AND
LO
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
GOD
HAD
NOT
SENT
HIM
BUT
THAT
HE
PRONOUNCED
THIS
PROPHECY
AGAINST
ME
FOR
TOBIAH
AND
SANBALLAT
HAD
HIRED
HIM
THEREFORE
WAS
HE
HIRED
THAT
I
SHOULD
BE
AFRAID
AND
DO
SO
AND
SIN
AND
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
MATTER
FOR
AN
EVIL
REPORT
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
REPROACH
ME
MY
GOD
THINK
THOU
UPON
TOBIAH
AND
SANBALLAT
ACCORDING
TO
THESE
THEIR
WORKS
AND
ON
THE
PROPHETESS
NOADIAH
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
PROPHETS
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
PUT
ME
IN
FEAR
SO
THE
WALL
WAS
FINISHED
IN
THE
TWENTY
AND
FIFTH
DAY
OF
THE
MONTH
ELUL
IN
FIFTY
AND
TWO
DAYS
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
ALL
OUR
ENEMIES
HEARD
THEREOF
AND
ALL
THE
HEATHEN
THAT
WERE
ABOUT
US
SAW
THESE
THINGS
THEY
WERE
MUCH
CAST
DOWN
IN
THEIR
OWN
EYES
FOR
THEY
PERCEIVED
THAT
THIS
WORK
WAS
WROUGHT
OF
OUR
GOD
MOREOVER
IN
THOSE
DAYS
THE
NOBLES
OF
JUDAH
SENT
MANY
LETTERS
UNTO
TOBIAH
AND
THE
LETTERS
OF
TOBIAH
CAME
UNTO
THEM
FOR
THERE
WERE
MANY
IN
JUDAH
SWORN
UNTO
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
THE
SON
IN
LAW
OF
SHECHANIAH
THE
SON
OF
ARAH
AND
HIS
SON
JOHANAN
HAD
TAKEN
THE
DAUGHTER
OF
MESHULLAM
THE
SON
OF
BERECHIAH
ALSO
THEY
REPORTED
HIS
GOOD
DEEDS
BEFORE
ME
AND
UTTERED
MY
WORDS
TO
HIM
AND
TOBIAH
SENT
LETTERS
TO
PUT
ME
IN
FEAR
NOW
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
WALL
WAS
BUILT
AND
I
HAD
SET
UP
THE
DOORS
AND
THE
PORTERS
AND
THE
SINGERS
AND
THE
LEVITES
WERE
APPOINTED
THAT
I
GAVE
MY
BROTHER
HANANI
AND
HANANIAH
THE
RULER
OF
THE
PALACE
CHARGE
OVER
JERUSALEM
FOR
HE
WAS
A
FAITHFUL
MAN
AND
FEARED
GOD
ABOVE
MANY
AND
I
SAID
UNTO
THEM
LET
NOT
THE
GATES
OF
JERUSALEM
BE
OPENED
UNTIL
THE
SUN
BE
HOT
AND
WHILE
THEY
STAND
BY
LET
THEM
SHUT
THE
DOORS
AND
BAR
THEM
AND
APPOINT
WATCHES
OF
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
JERUSALEM
EVERY
ONE
IN
HIS
WATCH
AND
EVERY
ONE
TO
BE
OVER
AGAINST
HIS
HOUSE
NOW
THE
CITY
WAS
LARGE
AND
GREAT
BUT
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
FEW
THEREIN
AND
THE
HOUSES
WERE
NOT
BUILDED
AND
MY
GOD
PUT
INTO
MINE
HEART
TO
GATHER
TOGETHER
THE
NOBLES
AND
THE
RULERS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
BE
RECKONED
BY

AND
I
FOUND

OBTAINED
I

UNDERSTOOD
OF
THE
EVIL
THAT
ELIASHIB
DID
FOR
TOBIAH
IN
PREPARING
HIM
A
CHAMBER
IN

NOT
BEEN
GIVEN

THAT
DID
THE

FORSAKEN

TOGETHER

COUNTED
FAITHFUL
AND
THEIR

REMEMBER
ME
O

CONCERNING

AND
WIPE
NOT
OUT
MY
GOOD
DEEDS
THAT
I
HAVE
DONE
FOR
THE

THEREOF
IN

UNTO
THE

AND
IN

THEN
I
CONTENDED
WITH
THE
NOBLES
OF

SAID
UNTO

WHAT
EVIL
THING
IS
THIS
THAT
YE
DO
AND
PROFANE
THE

DAY
DID
NOT
YOUR
FATHERS

THIS
EVIL
UPON
US
AND
UPON
THIS
CITY
YET

BRING
MORE
WRATH
UPON
ISRAEL
BY
PROFANING
THE
SABBATH
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
THE
GATES
OF
JERUSALEM
BEGAN
TO
BE
DARK
BEFORE
THE

I
COMMANDED
THAT
THE
GATES
SHOULD
BE
SHUT
AND
CHARGED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
BE
OPENED
TILL
AFTER
THE
SABBATH
AND
SOME
OF
MY
SERVANTS
SET
I
AT
THE
GATES
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
NO
BURDEN
BE
BROUGHT
IN
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
SO
THE
MERCHANTS
AND
SELLERS
OF
ALL
KIND
OF
WARE
LODGED
WITHOUT
JERUSALEM
ONCE
OR
TWICE
THEN
I
TESTIFIED
AGAINST
THEM
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
LODGE
YE
ABOUT
THE
WALL
IF
YE
DO
SO
AGAIN
I
WILL
LAY
HANDS
ON
YOU
FROM
THAT

FORTH
CAME

SHOULD
CLEANSE
THEMSELVES
AND
THAT

SHOULD
COME
AND
KEEP
THE
GATES
TO
SANCTIFY
THE

DAY
REMEMBER

YOUR
DAUGHTERS
UNTO
THEIR

YET
AMONG

THERE
NO

MADE
HIM
KING
OVER
ALL
ISRAEL
NEVERTHELESS
EVEN

REVERENCE
THEN
WAS
HAMAN
FULL
OF
WRATH
AND

THE

WHEREFORE

AND
LIFE
UNTO
THE
BITTER
IN
SOUL
WHICH
LONG
FOR
DEATH

MORE
THAN
FOR
HID
TREASURES
WHICH
REJOICE
EXCEEDINGLY
AND
ARE
GLAD
WHEN

CAN
FIND
THE

WHY
IS
LIGHT
GIVEN

WHOSE

HID
AND
WHOM
GOD
HATH
HEDGED
IN
FOR
MY

COMETH
BEFORE

ARE
POURED
OUT
LIKE
THE

FOR
THE
THING
WHICH
I
GREATLY
FEARED
IS
COME
UPON

AND
THAT
WHICH
I
WAS
AFRAID
OF
IS
COME
UNTO
ME
I
WAS
NOT
IN

NEITHER
HAD
I
REST
NEITHER
WAS
I
QUIET
YET
TROUBLE
CAME
THEN
ELIPHAZ
THE
TEMANITE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
IF

HIMSELF
FROM

BEHOLD
THOU
HAST
INSTRUCTED
MANY
AND
THOU
HAST
STRENGTHENED
THE
WEAK
HANDS
THY

HAVE
UPHOLDEN
HIM
THAT
WAS
FALLING
AND
THOU
HAST
STRENGTHENED
THE
FEEBLE
KNEES
BUT
NOW
IT
IS
COME
UPON
THEE
AND
THOU
FAINTEST
IT
TOUCHETH
THEE
AND
THOU
ART
TROUBLED
IS
NOT
THIS
THY
FEAR
THY
CONFIDENCE
THY
HOPE
AND
THE
UPRIGHTNESS
OF
THY
WAYS
REMEMBER
I
PRAY
THEE
WHO
EVER
PERISHED
BEING
INNOCENT
OR
WHERE
WERE
THE
RIGHTEOUS
CUT
OFF
EVEN
AS
I
HAVE
SEEN
THEY
THAT
PLOW
INIQUITY
AND
SOW
WICKEDNESS
REAP
THE
SAME
BY
THE
BLAST
OF
GOD
THEY
PERISH
AND
BY
THE
BREATH
OF
HIS
NOSTRILS
ARE
THEY
CONSUMED
THE
ROARING
OF
THE
LION
AND
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
FIERCE
LION
AND
THE
TEETH
OF
THE
YOUNG
LIONS
ARE
BROKEN
THE
OLD
LION
PERISHETH
FOR
LACK
OF
PREY
AND
THE
STOUT
LION'S
WHELPS
ARE
SCATTERED
ABROAD
NOW
A
THING
WAS
SECRETLY
BROUGHT
TO
ME
AND
MINE
EAR
RECEIVED
A
LITTLE
THEREOF
IN
THOUGHTS
FROM
THE
VISIONS
OF
THE
NIGHT
WHEN
DEEP
SLEEP
FALLETH
ON
MEN
FEAR
CAME
UPON
ME
AND
TREMBLING
WHICH
MADE
ALL
MY
BONES
TO
SHAKE
THEN
A
SPIRIT
PASSED
BEFORE
MY
FACE
THE
HAIR
OF
MY
FLESH
STOOD
UP
IT
STOOD
STILL
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
DISCERN
THE
FORM
THEREOF
AN
IMAGE
WAS
BEFORE
MINE
EYES
THERE
WAS
SILENCE
AND
I
HEARD
A
VOICE
SAYING
SHALL
MORTAL
MAN
BE
MORE
JUST
THAN
GOD
SHALL
A
MAN
BE
MORE
PURE
THAN
HIS
MAKER
BEHOLD
HE
PUT
NO
TRUST
IN
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
HIS
ANGELS
HE
CHARGED
WITH
FOLLY
HOW
MUCH
LESS
IN
THEM
THAT
DWELL
IN
HOUSES
OF
CLAY
WHOSE
FOUNDATION
IS
IN
THE
DUST
WHICH
ARE
CRUSHED
BEFORE
THE
MOTH
THEY
ARE
DESTROYED
FROM
MORNING
TO
EVENING
THEY
PERISH
FOR
EVER
WITHOUT
ANY
REGARDING
IT
DOTH
NOT
THEIR
EXCELLENCY
WHICH
IS
IN
THEM
GO
AWAY
THEY
DIE
EVEN
WITHOUT
WISDOM
CALL
NOW
IF
THERE
BE
ANY
THAT
WILL
ANSWER
THEE
AND
TO
WHICH
OF
THE
SAINTS
WILT
THOU
TURN
FOR
WRATH
KILLETH
THE
FOOLISH
MAN
AND
ENVY
SLAYETH
THE
SILLY
ONE
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
FOOLISH
TAKING
ROOT
BUT
SUDDENLY
I
CURSED
HIS
HABITATION
HIS
CHILDREN
ARE
FAR
FROM
SAFETY
AND
THEY
ARE
CRUSHED
IN
THE
GATE
NEITHER
IS
THERE
ANY
TO
DELIVER
THEM
WHOSE
HARVEST
THE
HUNGRY
EATETH
UP
AND
TAKETH
IT
EVEN
OUT
OF
THE
THORNS
AND
THE
ROBBER
SWALLOWETH
UP
THEIR
SUBSTANCE
ALTHOUGH
AFFLICTION
COMETH
NOT
FORTH
OF
THE

NEITHER
DOTH
TROUBLE
SPRING
OUT
OF

YET
MAN

BORN
UNTO
TROUBLE
AS
THE

BE
EXALTED
TO

HE
DISAPPOINTETH
THE
DEVICES
OF
THE

SO
THAT
THEIR

CANNOT
PERFORM
THEIR

HE
TAKETH
THE
WISE
IN
THEIR

CRAFTINESS
AND
THE
COUNSEL
OF
THE
FROWARD
IS
CARRIED
HEADLONG
THEY
MEET
WITH
DARKNESS
IN

IN

FROM

LAID
IN

TOGETHER
FOR

IT
WOULD

THEREFORE
MY

ARE
SWALLOWED
UP
FOR
THE
ARROWS
OF
THE
ALMIGHTY
ARE
WITHIN

THE
POISON
WHEREOF
DRINKETH
UP

THAT

THEN
SHOULD
I

YEA
I

HARDEN
MYSELF
IN

LET

FOR
I
HAVE
NOT
CONCEALED
THE

WHAT

THAT
I

END
THAT

MY

IS
MY

THE
STRENGTH
OF

MY

IS
NOT
MY

AND
IS
WISDOM
DRIVEN
QUITE
FROM

TO
HIM
THAT
IS
AFFLICTED
PITY
SHOULD
BE
SHEWED
FROM
HIS

BUT
HE
FORSAKETH
THE
FEAR
OF
THE

MY

HAVE
DEALT
DECEITFULLY
AS

THEY

THEY

OUT

THE

THEY
GO
TO
NOTHING
AND
PERISH
THE
TROOPS
OF
TEMA
LOOKED
THE

OF

THEY

BECAUSE
THEY

FOR

YE

AND
I
WILL
HOLD
MY

MY

INIQUITY
IN

DISCERN
PERVERSE
THINGS
IS
THERE
NOT
AN

TO

UPON

ARE
NOT
HIS

AS
A

EARNESTLY
DESIRETH
THE

AND
AS
AN

LOOKETH
FOR
THE

SO
AM
I

WHEN
I

DOWN
I

AND
THE

FRO
UNTO
THE

MY

IS
CLOTHED
WITH
WORMS
AND
CLODS
OF
DUST
MY

IS
BROKEN
AND
BECOME
LOATHSOME
MY
DAYS
ARE
SWIFTER
THAN
A
WEAVER'S
SHUTTLE
AND
ARE
SPENT
WITHOUT

O
REMEMBER
THAT
MY

IS
WIND
MINE

NO

THE

OF
HIM
THAT
HATH

SHALL

NO

THINE

ARE
UPON

AND
I
AM
NOT

COME
UP
NO

NO

NEITHER

THEREFORE
I

I

I

THROUGH

SO
THAT
MY

CHOOSETH
STRANGLING
AND
DEATH
RATHER

I
LOATHE
IT
I

NOT

ALWAY
LET

ALONE
FOR

ARE
VANITY
WHAT

MAN
THAT
THOU

HOW

WILT
THOU
NOT
DEPART
FROM

WHY

I
AM
A

AND
WHY
DOST
THOU
NOT
PARDON
MY

AND
TAKE
AWAY
MY

FOR
NOW
SHALL
I
SLEEP
IN
THE

AND
THOU
SHALT
SEEK

IN
THE

BUT
I
SHALL
NOT
BE
THEN
ANSWERED
BILDAD
THE
SHUHITE
AND
SAID
HOW
LONG
WILT
THOU
SPEAK
THESE
THINGS
AND
HOW
LONG
SHALL
THE

OF

BE
LIKE
A
STRONG

DOTH
GOD
PERVERT
JUDGMENT
OR
DOTH
THE
ALMIGHTY
PERVERT
JUSTICE
IF
THY
CHILDREN
HAVE
SINNED
AGAINST

AND
HE
HAVE
CAST
THEM
AWAY
FOR
THEIR

IF
THOU
WOULDEST
SEEK
UNTO
GOD
BETIMES
AND
MAKE
THY
SUPPLICATION
TO
THE

IF
THOU
WERT
PURE
AND

SURELY
NOW
HE

AWAKE
FOR

AND
MAKE
THE

RIGHTEOUSNESS
PROSPEROUS
THOUGH
THY
BEGINNING
WAS
SMALL
YET
THY

END
SHOULD
GREATLY
INCREASE
FOR
ENQUIRE
I
PRAY
THEE
OF
THE

AGE
AND
PREPARE
THYSELF
TO
THE

OF
THEIR

FOR
WE
ARE
BUT
OF

AND
KNOW
NOTHING
BECAUSE
OUR

UPON

ARE
A

SHALL
NOT
THEY
TEACH
THEE
AND
TELL
THEE
AND
UTTER

OUT

CAN
THE

GROW
UP
WITHOUT

CAN
THE

GROW
WITHOUT

WHILST
IT

SO
ARE
THE

THE

PERISH
WHOSE

BE
CUT

AND
WHOSE
TRUST

BE
A
SPIDER'S
WEB
HE

LEAN
UPON
HIS

BUT
IT

NOT
STAND
HE
SHALL
HOLD
IT
FAST
BUT
IT
SHALL
NOT
ENDURE
HE
IS
GREEN
BEFORE
THE

AND
HIS

SHOOTETH
FORTH
IN

HIS
ROOTS
ARE
WRAPPED
ABOUT
THE

AND
SEETH
THE
PLACE
OF

IF

THEN
IT

DENY
HIM
SAYING
I

THEE
BEHOLD
THIS
IS
THE
JOY
OF

AND
OUT

GROW
BEHOLD
GOD
WILL
NOT

A

NEITHER

HELP
THE

DOERS
TILL

THEY

ANSWERED

BUT
HOW

MAN
BE
JUST
WITH

IF

CONTEND
WITH

HE
CANNOT
ANSWER
HIM
ONE
OF
A
THOUSAND
HE
IS
WISE
IN

AND
MIGHTY
IN
STRENGTH
WHO
HATH
HARDENED
HIMSELF
AGAINST
HIM
AND
HATH
PROSPERED
WHICH
REMOVETH
THE
MOUNTAINS
AND
THEY
KNOW
NOT
WHICH
OVERTURNETH
THEM
IN
HIS
ANGER
WHICH
SHAKETH
THE
EARTH
OUT
OF
HER

AND
THE
PILLARS
THEREOF
TREMBLE
WHICH
COMMANDETH
THE

AND
IT

SEALETH
UP
THE
STARS
WHICH
ALONE
SPREADETH
OUT
THE

AND
TREADETH
UPON
THE
WAVES
OF
THE

WHICH
MAKETH
ARCTURUS
ORION
AND
PLEIADES
AND
THE

OF
THE

WHICH
DOETH
GREAT

PAST
FINDING
OUT
YEA

WITHOUT

LO
HE
GOETH
BY

I
PERCEIVE
HIM
NOT

HE
TAKETH

WHO

HINDER
HIM
WHO
WILL

WHAT

THOU
IF
GOD
WILL

WITHDRAW
HIS

THE

DO
STOOP
UNDER

HOW
MUCH
LESS
SHALL
I
ANSWER
HIM
AND
CHOOSE
OUT
MY
WORDS
TO
REASON
WITH
HIM
WHOM
THOUGH
I
WERE
RIGHTEOUS
YET
WOULD
I
NOT
ANSWER
BUT
I
WOULD
MAKE
SUPPLICATION
TO
MY
JUDGE
IF
I
HAD
CALLED
AND
HE
HAD
ANSWERED
ME
YET
WOULD
I
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
HAD
HEARKENED
UNTO
MY

FOR
HE
BREAKETH
ME
WITH
A
TEMPEST
AND
MULTIPLIETH
MY
WOUNDS
WITHOUT

HE
WILL
NOT
SUFFER
ME
TO
TAKE
MY
BREATH
BUT
FILLETH
ME
WITH
BITTERNESS
IF
I
SPEAK
OF
STRENGTH
LO
HE
IS
STRONG
AND
IF
OF

WHO
SHALL
SET
ME
A

TO
PLEAD
IF
I
JUSTIFY
MYSELF
MINE

SHALL
CONDEMN

IF
I

I

IT

ALSO
PROVE
ME
PERVERSE
THOUGH
I
WERE
PERFECT
YET
WOULD
I
NOT
KNOW
MY

I
WOULD
DESPISE
MY

THIS
IS
ONE
THING
THEREFORE
I
SAID
IT
HE
DESTROYETH
THE
PERFECT
AND
THE
WICKED
IF
THE
SCOURGE
SLAY
SUDDENLY
HE
WILL
LAUGH
AT
THE

OF
THE

THE

IS
GIVEN
INTO

THEREOF
IF

NOW
MY

NEITHER
IS

THEREFORE
HE
KNOWETH
THEIR

AND
HE
OVERTURNETH
THEM
IN
THE

SO
THAT
THEY
ARE
DESTROYED
HE
STRIKETH
THEM
AS
WICKED
MEN
IN
THE

SIGHT
OF
OTHERS
BECAUSE
THEY
TURNED
BACK
FROM

THE

OF

AND
REFUSED
TO

IN
HIS
LAW
AND
FORGAT
HIS
WORKS
AND
HIS

THAT

MARVELLOUS
THINGS
DID
HE
IN
THE

OF
THEIR

IN
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
IN
THE
FIELD
OF

HE
DIVIDED
THE

AND
CAUSED
THEM
TO

THROUGH
AND
HE
MADE
THE

TO

AS
AN

IN

ALSO
HE
LED
THEM
WITH
A

AND
ALL
THE

WITH

OF

HE
CLAVE
THE
ROCKS
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
GAVE
THEM
DRINK
AS
OUT
OF
THE
GREAT
DEPTHS
HE
BROUGHT
STREAMS
ALSO
OUT
OF
THE

AND
CAUSED
WATERS
TO
RUN
DOWN
LIKE
RIVERS
AND
THEY
SINNED
YET
MORE
AGAINST
HIM
BY
PROVOKING
THE
MOST
HIGH
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
THEY
TEMPTED
GOD
IN
THEIR
HEART
BY
ASKING
MEAT
FOR
THEIR
LUST
YEA
THEY
SPAKE
AGAINST
GOD
THEY
SAID
CAN
GOD
FURNISH
A
TABLE
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
BEHOLD
HE
SMOTE
THE
ROCK
THAT
THE
WATERS
GUSHED
OUT
AND
THE

OVERFLOWED
CAN
HE
GIVE
BREAD
ALSO
CAN
HE
PROVIDE
FLESH
FOR
HIS

THEREFORE
THE
LORD
HEARD
THIS
AND
WAS
WROTH
SO
A
FIRE
WAS
KINDLED
AGAINST
JACOB
AND
ANGER
ALSO
CAME
UP
AGAINST
ISRAEL
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVED
NOT
IN
GOD
AND
TRUSTED
NOT
IN
HIS
SALVATION
THOUGH
HE
HAD
COMMANDED
THE
CLOUDS
FROM
ABOVE
AND
OPENED
THE
DOORS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
HAD
RAINED
DOWN
MANNA
UPON
THEM
TO
EAT
AND
HAD
GIVEN
THEM
OF
THE
CORN
OF

MAN
DID
EAT
ANGELS'
FOOD
HE
SENT
THEM
MEAT
TO
THE
FULL
HE
CAUSED
AN
EAST
WIND
TO
BLOW
IN
THE
HEAVEN
AND
BY
HIS
POWER
HE
BROUGHT
IN
THE
SOUTH
WIND
HE
RAINED
FLESH
ALSO
UPON
THEM
AS
DUST
AND
FEATHERED
FOWLS
LIKE
AS
THE
SAND
OF
THE
SEA
AND
HE
LET
IT
FALL
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEIR
CAMP
ROUND
ABOUT
THEIR
HABITATIONS
SO
THEY
DID
EAT
AND
WERE
WELL
FILLED
FOR
HE
GAVE
THEM
THEIR
OWN
DESIRE
THEY
WERE
NOT
ESTRANGED
FROM
THEIR
LUST
BUT
WHILE
THEIR
MEAT
WAS
YET
IN
THEIR
MOUTHS
THE
WRATH
OF
GOD
CAME
UPON
THEM
AND
SLEW
THE
FATTEST
OF
THEM
AND
SMOTE
DOWN
THE
CHOSEN
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
ALL
THIS
THEY
SINNED
STILL
AND
BELIEVED
NOT
FOR
HIS
WONDROUS
WORKS
THEREFORE
THEIR
DAYS
DID
HE
CONSUME
IN
VANITY
AND
THEIR
YEARS
IN
TROUBLE
WHEN
HE
SLEW
THEM
THEN
THEY
SOUGHT
HIM
AND
THEY
RETURNED
AND
ENQUIRED
EARLY
AFTER
GOD
AND
THEY
REMEMBERED
THAT
GOD
WAS
THEIR
ROCK
AND
THE
HIGH
GOD
THEIR
REDEEMER
NEVERTHELESS
THEY
DID
FLATTER
HIM
WITH
THEIR
MOUTH
AND
THEY
LIED
UNTO
HIM
WITH
THEIR
TONGUES
FOR
THEIR
HEART
WAS
NOT
RIGHT
WITH
HIM
NEITHER
WERE
THEY
STEDFAST
IN
HIS
COVENANT
BUT
HE
BEING
FULL
OF
COMPASSION
FORGAVE
THEIR
INIQUITY
AND
DESTROYED
THEM
NOT
YEA
MANY
A
TIME
TURNED
HE
HIS
ANGER
AWAY
AND
DID
NOT
STIR
UP
ALL
HIS
WRATH
FOR
HE
REMEMBERED
THAT
THEY
WERE
BUT
FLESH
A
WIND
THAT
PASSETH
AWAY
AND
COMETH
NOT
AGAIN
HOW
OFT
DID
THEY
PROVOKE
HIM
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
GRIEVE
HIM
IN
THE
DESERT
YEA
THEY
TURNED
BACK
AND
TEMPTED
GOD
AND
LIMITED
THE
HOLY
ONE
OF
ISRAEL
THEY
REMEMBERED
NOT
HIS
HAND
NOR
THE
DAY
WHEN
HE
DELIVERED
THEM
FROM
THE
ENEMY
HOW
HE
HAD
WROUGHT
HIS
SIGNS
IN
EGYPT
AND
HIS
WONDERS
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
ZOAN
AND
HAD
TURNED
THEIR
RIVERS
INTO
BLOOD
AND
THEIR
FLOODS
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
DRINK
HE
SENT
DIVERS
SORTS
OF
FLIES
AMONG
THEM
WHICH
DEVOURED
THEM
AND
FROGS
WHICH
DESTROYED
THEM
HE
GAVE
ALSO
THEIR
INCREASE
UNTO
THE
CATERPILLER
AND
THEIR
LABOUR
UNTO
THE
LOCUST
HE
DESTROYED
THEIR
VINES
WITH
HAIL
AND
THEIR
SYCOMORE
TREES
WITH
FROST
HE
GAVE
UP
THEIR
CATTLE
ALSO
TO
THE
HAIL
AND
THEIR
FLOCKS
TO
HOT
THUNDERBOLTS
HE
CAST
UPON
THEM
THE
FIERCENESS
OF
HIS
ANGER
WRATH
AND
INDIGNATION
AND
TROUBLE
BY
SENDING
EVIL
ANGELS
AMONG
THEM
HE
MADE
A
WAY
TO
HIS
ANGER
HE
SPARED
NOT
THEIR
SOUL
FROM
DEATH
BUT
GAVE
THEIR
LIFE
OVER
TO
THE
PESTILENCE
AND
SMOTE
ALL
THE
FIRSTBORN
IN
EGYPT
THE
CHIEF
OF
THEIR
STRENGTH
IN
THE
TABERNACLES
OF
HAM
BUT
MADE
HIS
OWN
PEOPLE
TO
GO
FORTH
LIKE
SHEEP
AND
GUIDED
THEM
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
LIKE
A
FLOCK
AND
HE
LED
THEM
ON
SAFELY
SO
THAT
THEY
FEARED
NOT
BUT
THE
SEA
OVERWHELMED
THEIR
ENEMIES
AND
HE
BROUGHT
THEM
TO
THE
BORDER
OF
HIS
SANCTUARY
EVEN
TO
THIS
MOUNTAIN
WHICH
HIS
RIGHT
HAND
HAD
PURCHASED
HE
CAST
OUT
THE
HEATHEN
ALSO
BEFORE
THEM
AND
DIVIDED
THEM
AN
INHERITANCE
BY
LINE
AND
MADE
THE
TRIBES
OF
ISRAEL
TO
DWELL
IN
THEIR
TENTS
YET
THEY
TEMPTED
AND
PROVOKED
THE
MOST
HIGH
GOD
AND
KEPT
NOT
HIS
TESTIMONIES
BUT
TURNED
BACK
AND
DEALT
UNFAITHFULLY
LIKE
THEIR
FATHERS
THEY
WERE
TURNED
ASIDE
LIKE
A
DECEITFUL
BOW
FOR
THEY
PROVOKED
HIM
TO
ANGER
WITH
THEIR
HIGH
PLACES
AND
MOVED
HIM
TO
JEALOUSY
WITH
THEIR
GRAVEN
IMAGES
WHEN
GOD
HEARD
THIS
HE
WAS
WROTH
AND
GREATLY
ABHORRED
ISRAEL
SO
THAT
HE
FORSOOK
THE
TABERNACLE
OF
SHILOH
THE
TENT
WHICH
HE
PLACED
AMONG
MEN
AND
DELIVERED
HIS
STRENGTH
INTO
CAPTIVITY
AND
HIS
GLORY
INTO
THE
ENEMY'S
HAND
HE
GAVE
HIS
PEOPLE
OVER
ALSO
UNTO
THE
SWORD
AND
WAS
WROTH
WITH
HIS
INHERITANCE
THE
FIRE
CONSUMED
THEIR

WERE
NOT
GIVEN
TO
MARRIAGE
THEIR

FELL
BY
THE

AWAKED
AS

OUT
OF

AND
LIKE
A
MIGHTY
MAN
THAT
SHOUTETH
BY
REASON
OF
WINE
AND
HE
SMOTE
HIS
ENEMIES
IN
THE
HINDER
PARTS
HE
PUT
THEM
TO
A
PERPETUAL
REPROACH
MOREOVER
HE
REFUSED
THE

SO
THAT
IT
WENT
ILL
WITH

FOR

BECAUSE
THEY
PROVOKED

SO
THAT
HE
SPAKE
UNADVISEDLY
WITH

THEY
DID
NOT

INSOMUCH

THEY
PROVOKED
HIM
WITH

NEVERTHELESS
HE
REGARDED
THEIR

THE

WITH
THORNS
AND
NETTLES
HAD
COVERED
THE

THE

A

THESE
ARE

PROVERBS
OF

WHICH
THE
MEN
OF
HEZEKIAH
KING
OF
JUDAH
COPIED
OUT
IT
IS
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
TO
CONCEAL
A

BUT
THE
HONOUR
OF

IS
TO

OUT
A

THE
HEAVEN
FOR

AND
THE

FOR

AND
THE
HEART
OF

IS
UNSEARCHABLE
TAKE

THE

FROM

AND
THERE

COME
FORTH
A
VESSEL
FOR

TAKE

THE

HITHER

WHOM
THINE

GO

LEST
THOU

THEREOF
WHEN

DEBATE

AND
THINE
INFAMY
TURN

A

FITLY
SPOKEN
IS
LIKE
APPLES
OF
GOLD
IN
PICTURES
OF
SILVER
AS
AN
EARRING
OF
GOLD
AND
AN
ORNAMENT
OF

GOLD
SO
IS
A
WISE
REPROVER
UPON
AN
OBEDIENT

AS
THE
COLD
OF

IN

SO
IS
A

THAT
SEND

FOR
HE
REFRESHETH
THE

OF
HIS

WHOSO
BOASTETH
HIMSELF
OF
A
FALSE
GIFT
IS
LIKE
CLOUDS
AND
WIND
WITHOUT

BY
LONG
FORBEARING
IS
A
PRINCE
PERSUADED
AND
A

TONGUE
BREAKETH
THE

HAST

HONEY
EAT
SO
MUCH
AS
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THEE
LEST
THOU
BE

THEREWITH
AND
VOMIT
IT
WITHDRAW
THY

FROM
THY

LEST
HE
BE
WEARY
OF
THEE
AND
SO
HATE
THEE
A
MAN
THAT
BEARETH
FALSE
WITNESS
AGAINST
HIS

IS
A
MAUL
AND
A
SWORD
AND
A
SHARP
ARROW
CONFIDENCE
IN
AN
UNFAITHFUL
MAN
IN
TIME
OF
TROUBLE
IS
LIKE
A
BROKEN
TOOTH
AND
A
FOOT
OUT
OF
JOINT
AS
HE
THAT
TAKETH
AWAY
A
GARMENT
IN
COLD
WEATHER
AND
AS
VINEGAR
UPON
NITRE
SO
IS
HE
THAT
SINGETH
SONGS
TO
AN
HEAVY

IF
THINE

BE
HUNGRY
GIVE

BREAD
TO
EAT
AND
IF
HE
BE
THIRSTY
GIVE
HIM
WATER
TO

FOR
THOU
SHALT
HEAP
COALS
OF
FIRE
UPON
HIS

AND
THE
LORD
SHALL
REWARD
THEE
THE
NORTH
WIND
DRIVETH
AWAY
RAIN
SO
DOTH
AN
ANGRY
COUNTENANCE
A
BACKBITING
TONGUE
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
DWELL
IN
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
HOUSETOP
THAN
WITH
A
BRAWLING
WOMAN
AND
IN
A
WIDE
HOUSE
AS
COLD
WATERS
TO
A
THIRSTY
SOUL
SO
IS
GOOD
NEWS
FROM
A
FAR
COUNTRY
A
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
FALLING
DOWN
BEFORE
THE
WICKED
IS
AS
A
TROUBLED
FOUNTAIN
AND
A
CORRUPT
SPRING
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
EAT
MUCH
HONEY
SO
FOR
MEN
TO
SEARCH
THEIR
OWN
GLORY
IS
NOT
GLORY
HE
THAT
HATH
NO
RULE
OVER
HIS
OWN
SPIRIT
IS
LIKE
A
CITY
THAT
IS
BROKEN
DOWN
AND
WITHOUT
WALLS
AS
SNOW
IN
SUMMER
AND
AS
RAIN
IN
HARVEST
SO
HONOUR
IS
NOT
SEEMLY
FOR
A
FOOL
AS
THE
BIRD
BY
WANDERING
AS
THE
SWALLOW
BY
FLYING
SO
THE
CURSE
CAUSELESS
SHALL
NOT
COME
A
WHIP
FOR
THE
HORSE
A
BRIDLE
FOR
THE
ASS
AND
A
ROD
FOR
THE
FOOL'S
BACK
ANSWER
NOT
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
THOU
ALSO
BE
LIKE
UNTO
HIM
ANSWER
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
HE
BE
WISE
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
HE
THAT
SENDETH
A
MESSAGE
BY
THE
HAND
OF
A
FOOL
CUTTETH
OFF
THE
FEET
AND
DRINKETH
DAMAGE
THE
LEGS
OF
THE
LAME
ARE
NOT
EQUAL
SO
IS
A
PARABLE
IN
THE
MOUTH
OF
FOOLS
AS
HE
THAT
BINDETH
A
STONE
IN
A
SLING
SO
IS
HE
THAT
GIVETH
HONOUR
TO
A
FOOL
AS
A
THORN
GOETH
UP
INTO
THE
HAND
OF
A
DRUNKARD
SO
IS
A
PARABLE
IN
THE
MOUTHS
OF
FOOLS
THE
GREAT
GOD
THAT
FORMED
ALL
THINGS
BOTH
REWARDETH
THE
FOOL
AND
REWARDETH
TRANSGRESSORS
AS
A
DOG
RETURNETH
TO
HIS
VOMIT
SO
A
FOOL
RETURNETH
TO
HIS
FOLLY
SEEST
THOU
A
MAN
WISE
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
THERE
IS
MORE
HOPE
OF
A
FOOL
THAN
OF
HIM
THE
SLOTHFUL
MAN
SAITH
THERE
IS
A
LION
IN
THE
WAY
A
LION
IS
IN
THE
STREETS
AS
THE
DOOR
TURNETH
UPON
HIS
HINGES
SO
DOTH
THE
SLOTHFUL
UPON
HIS
BED
THE
SLOTHFUL
HIDETH
HIS
HAND
IN
HIS
BOSOM
IT
GRIEVETH
HIM
TO
BRING
IT
AGAIN
TO
HIS
MOUTH
THE
SLUGGARD
IS
WISER
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
THAN
SEVEN
MEN
THAT
CAN
RENDER
A
REASON
HE
THAT
PASSETH
BY
AND
MEDDLETH
WITH
STRIFE
BELONGING
NOT
TO
HIM
IS
LIKE
ONE
THAT
TAKETH
A
DOG
BY
THE
EARS
AS
A
MAD
MAN
WHO
CASTETH
FIREBRANDS
ARROWS
AND
DEATH
SO
IS
THE
MAN
THAT
DECEIVETH
HIS
NEIGHBOUR
AND
SAITH
AM
NOT
I
IN
SPORT
WHERE
NO
WOOD
IS
THERE
THE
FIRE
GOETH
OUT
SO
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
TALEBEARER
THE
STRIFE
CEASETH
AS
COALS
ARE
TO
BURNING
COALS
AND
WOOD
TO
FIRE
SO
IS
A
CONTENTIOUS
MAN
TO
KINDLE
STRIFE
THE
WORDS
OF
A
TALEBEARER
ARE
AS
WOUNDS
AND
THEY
GO
DOWN
INTO
THE
INNERMOST
PARTS
OF
THE
BELLY
BURNING
LIPS
AND
A
WICKED
HEART
ARE
LIKE
A
POTSHERD
COVERED
WITH
SILVER
DROSS
HE
THAT
HATETH
DISSEMBLETH
WITH
HIS

AND
LAYETH
UP
DECEIT
WITHIN

WHEN
HE
SPEAKETH
FAIR
BELIEVE
HIM
NOT
FOR
THERE
ARE
SEVEN
ABOMINATIONS
IN
HIS

WHOSE
HATRED
IS
COVERED
BY
DECEIT
HIS
WICKEDNESS
SHALL
BE
SHEWED
BEFORE
THE

WHOSO
DIGGETH
A

FALL
THEREIN
AND
HE
THAT

A

IT

RETURN
UPON

A

TONGUE
HATETH
THOSE
THAT
ARE
AFFLICTED
BY

FOR

LET
ANOTHER

A

A

THE

BUT
TO
THE

SOUL
EVERY

AS

BY

THINE

FORSAKE
NOT

FAR
OFF
MY

BE

AND
MAKE
MY

GLAD
THAT
I
MAY

HIM
THAT

A

SHARPENETH
THE
COUNTENANCE
OF
HIS

WHOSO
KEEPETH

THEREOF
SO
HE
THAT

BE
HONOURED
AS

THE

THE

FOR

THE

ARE
BOLD
AS

FOR
THE

OF

MANY

A

THE

SO
IS
A

RULER
OVER
THE

THE

THAT

WHOSO

THE

VANITY
OF

ALL
IS
VANITY
WHAT
PROFIT
HATH
A
MAN
OF
ALL
HIS
LABOUR
WHICH
HE
TAKETH
UNDER
THE
SUN
ONE
GENERATION
PASSETH
AWAY
AND
ANOTHER

COMETH
BUT
THE
EARTH
ABIDETH
FOR

THE

ALSO
ARISETH
AND
THE
SUN
GOETH
DOWN
AND
HASTETH
TO
HIS
PLACE
WHERE
HE
AROSE
THE

GOETH
TOWARD
THE
SOUTH
AND
TURNETH
ABOUT
UNTO
THE

IT
WHIRLETH
ABOUT
CONTINUALLY
AND
THE

RETURNETH
AGAIN
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
CIRCUITS
ALL
THE

RUN
INTO
THE

YET
THE
SEA
IS
NOT

UNTO
THE

FROM
WHENCE
THE

THITHER
THEY

ALL

ARE
FULL
OF

MAN
CANNOT
UTTER
IT
THE
EYE
IS
NOT
SATISFIED
WITH
SEEING
NOR
THE
EAR
FILLED
WITH
HEARING
THE
THING
THAT
HATH
BEEN
IT
IS
THAT
WHICH
SHALL
BE
AND
THAT
WHICH
IS
DONE
IS
THAT
WHICH
SHALL
BE
DONE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
NEW

UNDER

IS
THERE
ANY

WHEREOF
IT
MAY
BE
SAID
SEE
THIS
IS
NEW
IT
HATH

THERE

NEITHER

THERE
BE
ANY

OF
THINGS
THAT
ARE
TO
COME
WITH
THOSE
THAT
SHALL
COME
AFTER
I
THE
PREACHER
WAS
KING
OVER
ISRAEL
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
I
GAVE
MY
HEART
TO
SEEK
AND
SEARCH
OUT
BY
WISDOM
CONCERNING
ALL
THINGS
THAT
ARE
DONE
UNDER
HEAVEN
THIS
SORE
TRAVAIL
HATH
GOD
GIVEN
TO
THE
SONS
OF
MAN
TO
BE
EXERCISED
THEREWITH
I
HAVE
SEEN
ALL
THE
WORKS
THAT
ARE
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
AND
BEHOLD
ALL
IS
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
THAT
WHICH
IS
CROOKED
CANNOT
BE
MADE
STRAIGHT
AND
THAT
WHICH
IS
WANTING
CANNOT
BE
NUMBERED
I
COMMUNED
WITH
MINE
OWN
HEART
SAYING
LO
I
AM
COME
TO
GREAT
ESTATE
AND
HAVE
GOTTEN
MORE
WISDOM
THAN
ALL
THEY
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
BEFORE
ME
IN
JERUSALEM
YEA
MY
HEART
HAD
GREAT
EXPERIENCE
OF
WISDOM
AND
KNOWLEDGE
AND
I
GAVE
MY
HEART
TO
KNOW
WISDOM
AND
TO
KNOW
MADNESS
AND
FOLLY
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
THIS
ALSO
IS
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
FOR
IN
MUCH
WISDOM
IS
MUCH
GRIEF
AND
HE
THAT
INCREASETH
KNOWLEDGE
INCREASETH
SORROW
I
SAID
IN
MINE
HEART
GO
TO
NOW
I
WILL
PROVE
THEE
WITH
MIRTH
THEREFORE
ENJOY
PLEASURE
AND
BEHOLD
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
I
SAID
OF
LAUGHTER
IT
IS
MAD
AND
OF
MIRTH
WHAT
DOETH
IT
I
SOUGHT
IN
MINE
HEART
TO
GIVE
MYSELF
UNTO
WINE
YET
ACQUAINTING
MINE
HEART
WITH
WISDOM
AND
TO
LAY
HOLD
ON
FOLLY
TILL
I
MIGHT
SEE
WHAT
WAS
THAT
GOOD
FOR
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
WHICH
THEY
SHOULD
DO
UNDER
THE
HEAVEN
ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
THEIR
LIFE
I
MADE
ME
GREAT
WORKS
I
BUILDED
ME
HOUSES
I
PLANTED
ME
VINEYARDS
I
MADE
ME
GARDENS
AND
ORCHARDS
AND
I
PLANTED
TREES
IN
THEM
OF
ALL
KIND
OF
FRUITS
I
MADE
ME
POOLS
OF
WATER
TO
WATER
THEREWITH
THE
WOOD
THAT
BRINGETH
FORTH
TREES
I
GOT
ME
SERVANTS
AND
MAIDENS
AND
HAD
SERVANTS
BORN
IN
MY
HOUSE
ALSO
I
HAD
GREAT
POSSESSIONS
OF
GREAT
AND
SMALL
CATTLE
ABOVE
ALL
THAT
WERE
IN
JERUSALEM
BEFORE
ME
I
GATHERED
ME
ALSO
SILVER
AND
GOLD
AND
THE
PECULIAR
TREASURE
OF
KINGS
AND
OF
THE
PROVINCES
I
GAT
ME
MEN
SINGERS
AND
WOMEN
SINGERS
AND
THE
DELIGHTS
OF
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
AS
MUSICAL
INSTRUMENTS
AND
THAT
OF
ALL
SORTS
SO
I
WAS
GREAT
AND
INCREASED
MORE
THAN
ALL
THAT
WERE
BEFORE
ME
IN
JERUSALEM
ALSO
MY
WISDOM
REMAINED
WITH
ME
AND
WHATSOEVER
MINE
EYES
DESIRED
I
KEPT
NOT
FROM
THEM
I
WITHHELD
NOT
MY
HEART
FROM
ANY
JOY
FOR
MY
HEART
REJOICED
IN
ALL
MY
LABOUR
AND
THIS
WAS
MY
PORTION
OF
ALL
MY
LABOUR
THEN
I
LOOKED
ON
ALL
THE
WORKS
THAT
MY
HANDS
HAD
WROUGHT
AND
ON
THE
LABOUR
THAT
I
HAD
LABOURED
TO
DO
AND
BEHOLD
ALL
WAS
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
PROFIT
UNDER
THE
SUN
AND
I
TURNED
MYSELF
TO
BEHOLD
WISDOM
AND
MADNESS
AND
FOLLY
FOR
WHAT
CAN
THE
MAN
DO
THAT
COMETH
AFTER
THE
KING
EVEN
THAT
WHICH
HATH
BEEN
ALREADY
DONE
THEN
I
SAW
THAT
WISDOM
EXCELLETH
FOLLY
AS
FAR
AS
LIGHT
EXCELLETH
DARKNESS
THE
WISE
MAN'S
EYES
ARE
IN
HIS
HEAD
BUT
THE
FOOL
WALKETH
IN
DARKNESS
AND
I
MYSELF
PERCEIVED
ALSO
THAT
ONE
EVENT
HAPPENETH
TO
THEM
ALL
THEN
SAID
I
IN
MY
HEART
AS
IT
HAPPENETH
TO
THE
FOOL
SO
IT
HAPPENETH
EVEN
TO
ME
AND
WHY
WAS
I
THEN
MORE
WISE
THEN
I
SAID
IN
MY
HEART
THAT
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
REMEMBRANCE
OF
THE
WISE
MORE
THAN
OF
THE
FOOL
FOR
EVER
SEEING
THAT
WHICH
NOW
IS
IN
THE
DAYS
TO
COME
SHALL
ALL
BE
FORGOTTEN
AND
HOW
DIETH
THE
WISE
MAN
AS
THE
FOOL
THEREFORE
I
HATED
LIFE
BECAUSE
THE
WORK
THAT
IS
WROUGHT
UNDER
THE
SUN
IS
GRIEVOUS
UNTO
ME
FOR
ALL
IS
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
YEA
I
HATED
ALL
MY
LABOUR
WHICH
I
HAD
TAKEN
UNDER
THE
SUN
BECAUSE
I
SHOULD
LEAVE
IT
UNTO
THE
MAN
THAT
SHALL
BE
AFTER
ME
AND
WHO
KNOWETH
WHETHER
HE
SHALL
BE
A
WISE
MAN
OR
A
FOOL
YET
SHALL
HE
HAVE
RULE
OVER
ALL
MY
LABOUR
WHEREIN
I
HAVE
LABOURED
AND
WHEREIN
I
HAVE
SHEWED
MYSELF
WISE
UNDER
THE
SUN
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
THEREFORE
I
WENT
ABOUT
TO
CAUSE
MY
HEART
TO
DESPAIR
OF
ALL
THE
LABOUR
WHICH
I
TOOK
UNDER
THE
SUN
FOR
THERE
IS
A
MAN
WHOSE
LABOUR
IS
IN
WISDOM
AND
IN
KNOWLEDGE
AND
IN
EQUITY
YET
TO
A
MAN
THAT
HATH
NOT
LABOURED
THEREIN
SHALL
HE
LEAVE
IT
FOR
HIS
PORTION
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
AND
A
GREAT
EVIL
FOR
WHAT
HATH
MAN
OF
ALL
HIS
LABOUR
AND
OF
THE
VEXATION
OF
HIS
HEART
WHEREIN
HE
HATH
LABOURED
UNDER
THE
SUN
FOR
ALL
HIS
DAYS
ARE
SORROWS
AND
HIS
TRAVAIL
GRIEF
YEA
HIS
HEART
TAKETH
NOT
REST
IN
THE
NIGHT
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
BETTER
FOR
A
MAN
THAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
EAT
AND
DRINK
AND
THAT
HE
SHOULD
MAKE
HIS
SOUL
ENJOY
GOOD
IN
HIS
LABOUR
THIS
ALSO
I
SAW
THAT
IT
WAS
FROM
THE
HAND
OF
GOD
FOR
WHO
CAN
EAT
OR
WHO
ELSE
CAN
HASTEN
HEREUNTO
MORE
THAN
I
FOR
GOD
GIVETH
TO
A
MAN
THAT
IS
GOOD
IN
HIS
SIGHT
WISDOM
AND
KNOWLEDGE
AND
JOY
BUT
TO
THE
SINNER
HE
GIVETH
TRAVAIL
TO
GATHER
AND
TO
HEAP
UP
THAT
HE
MAY
GIVE
TO
HIM
THAT
IS
GOOD
BEFORE
GOD
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
TO
EVERY
THING
THERE
IS
A
SEASON
AND
A
TIME
TO
EVERY
PURPOSE
UNDER
THE
HEAVEN
A
TIME
TO
BE
BORN
AND
A
TIME
TO
DIE
A
TIME
TO
PLANT
AND
A
TIME
TO
PLUCK
UP
THAT
WHICH
IS
PLANTED
A
TIME
TO
KILL
AND
A
TIME
TO
HEAL
A
TIME
TO
BREAK
DOWN
AND
A
TIME
TO
BUILD
UP
A
TIME
TO
WEEP
AND
A
TIME
TO
LAUGH
A
TIME
TO
MOURN
AND
A
TIME
TO
DANCE
A
TIME
TO
CAST
AWAY
STONES
AND
A
TIME
TO
GATHER
STONES
TOGETHER
A
TIME
TO
EMBRACE
AND
A
TIME
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
EMBRACING
A
TIME
TO
GET
AND
A
TIME
TO
LOSE
A
TIME
TO
KEEP
AND
A
TIME
TO
CAST
AWAY
A
TIME
TO
REND
AND
A
TIME
TO
SEW
A
TIME
TO
KEEP
SILENCE
AND
A
TIME
TO
SPEAK
A
TIME
TO
LOVE
AND
A
TIME
TO
HATE
A
TIME
OF
WAR
AND
A
TIME
OF
PEACE
WHAT
PROFIT
HATH
HE
THAT
WORKETH
IN
THAT
WHEREIN
HE
LABOURETH
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
TRAVAIL
WHICH
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
TO
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
TO
BE
EXERCISED
IN
IT
HE
HATH
MADE
EVERY
THING
BEAUTIFUL
IN
HIS
TIME
ALSO
HE
HATH
SET
THE
WORLD
IN
THEIR
HEART
SO
THAT
NO
MAN
CAN
FIND
OUT
THE
WORK
THAT
GOD
MAKETH
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
TO
THE
END
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
GOOD
IN
THEM
BUT
FOR
A
MAN
TO
REJOICE
AND
TO
DO
GOOD
IN
HIS
LIFE
AND
ALSO
THAT
EVERY
MAN
SHOULD
EAT
AND
DRINK
AND
ENJOY
THE
GOOD
OF
ALL
HIS
LABOUR
IT
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
I
KNOW
THAT
WHATSOEVER
GOD
DOETH
IT
SHALL
BE
FOR
EVER
NOTHING
CAN
BE
PUT
TO
IT
NOR
ANY
THING
TAKEN
FROM
IT
AND
GOD
DOETH
IT
THAT
MEN
SHOULD
FEAR
BEFORE
HIM
THAT
WHICH
HATH
BEEN
IS
NOW
AND
THAT
WHICH
IS
TO
BE
HATH
ALREADY
BEEN
AND
GOD
REQUIRETH
THAT
WHICH
IS
PAST
AND
MOREOVER
I
SAW
UNDER
THE
SUN
THE
PLACE
OF
JUDGMENT
THAT
WICKEDNESS
WAS
THERE
AND
THE
PLACE
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
THAT
INIQUITY
WAS
THERE
I
SAID
IN
MINE
HEART
GOD
SHALL
JUDGE
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AND
THE
WICKED
FOR
THERE
IS
A
TIME
THERE
FOR
EVERY
PURPOSE
AND
FOR
EVERY
WORK
I
SAID
IN
MINE
HEART
CONCERNING
THE
ESTATE
OF
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
THAT
GOD
MIGHT
MANIFEST
THEM
AND
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
SEE
THAT
THEY
THEMSELVES
ARE
BEASTS
FOR
THAT
WHICH
BEFALLETH
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
BEFALLETH
BEASTS
EVEN
ONE
THING
BEFALLETH
THEM
AS
THE
ONE
DIETH
SO
DIETH
THE
OTHER
YEA
THEY
HAVE
ALL
ONE
BREATH
SO
THAT
A
MAN
HATH
NO
PREEMINENCE
ABOVE
A
BEAST
FOR
ALL
IS
VANITY
ALL
GO
UNTO
ONE
PLACE
ALL
ARE
OF
THE
DUST
AND
ALL
TURN
TO
DUST
AGAIN
WHO
KNOWETH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
MAN
THAT
GOETH
UPWARD
AND
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
BEAST
THAT
GOETH
DOWNWARD
TO
THE
EARTH
WHEREFORE
I
PERCEIVE
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
BETTER
THAN
THAT
A
MAN
SHOULD
REJOICE
IN
HIS
OWN
WORKS
FOR
THAT
IS
HIS
PORTION
FOR
WHO
SHALL
BRING
HIM
TO
SEE
WHAT
SHALL
BE
AFTER
HIM
SO
I
RETURNED
AND
CONSIDERED
ALL
THE
OPPRESSIONS
THAT
ARE
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
AND
BEHOLD
THE
TEARS
OF
SUCH
AS
WERE
OPPRESSED
AND
THEY
HAD
NO
COMFORTER
AND
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THEIR
OPPRESSORS
THERE
WAS
POWER
BUT
THEY
HAD
NO
COMFORTER
WHEREFORE
I
PRAISED
THE
DEAD
WHICH
ARE
ALREADY
DEAD
MORE
THAN
THE
LIVING
WHICH
ARE
YET
ALIVE
YEA
BETTER
IS
HE
THAN
BOTH
THEY
WHICH
HATH
NOT
YET
BEEN
WHO
HATH
NOT
SEEN
THE
EVIL
WORK
THAT
IS
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
AGAIN
I
CONSIDERED
ALL
TRAVAIL
AND
EVERY
RIGHT
WORK
THAT
FOR
THIS
A
MAN
IS
ENVIED
OF
HIS
NEIGHBOUR
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
THE
FOOL
FOLDETH
HIS
HANDS
TOGETHER
AND
EATETH
HIS
OWN
FLESH
BETTER
IS
AN
HANDFUL
WITH
QUIETNESS
THAN
BOTH
THE
HANDS
FULL
WITH
TRAVAIL
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
THEN
I
RETURNED
AND
I
SAW
VANITY
UNDER
THE
SUN
THERE
IS
ONE
ALONE
AND
THERE
IS
NOT
A
SECOND
YEA
HE
HATH
NEITHER
CHILD
NOR
BROTHER
YET
IS
THERE
NO
END
OF
ALL
HIS
LABOUR
NEITHER
IS
HIS
EYE
SATISFIED
WITH
RICHES
NEITHER
SAITH
HE
FOR
WHOM
DO
I
LABOUR
AND
BEREAVE
MY
SOUL
OF
GOOD
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
YEA
IT
IS
A
SORE
TRAVAIL
TWO
ARE
BETTER
THAN
ONE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
A
GOOD
REWARD
FOR
THEIR
LABOUR
FOR
IF
THEY
FALL
THE
ONE
WILL
LIFT
UP
HIS
FELLOW
BUT
WOE
TO
HIM
THAT
IS
ALONE
WHEN
HE
FALLETH
FOR
HE
HATH
NOT
ANOTHER
TO
HELP
HIM
UP
AGAIN
IF
TWO
LIE
TOGETHER
THEN
THEY
HAVE
HEAT
BUT
HOW
CAN
ONE
BE
WARM
ALONE
AND
IF
ONE
PREVAIL
AGAINST
HIM
TWO
SHALL
WITHSTAND
HIM
AND
A
THREEFOLD
CORD
IS
NOT
QUICKLY
BROKEN
BETTER
IS
A
POOR
AND
A
WISE
CHILD
THAN
AN
OLD
AND
FOOLISH
KING
WHO
WILL
NO
MORE
BE
ADMONISHED
FOR
OUT
OF
PRISON
HE
COMETH
TO
REIGN
WHEREAS
ALSO
HE
THAT
IS
BORN
IN
HIS
KINGDOM
BECOMETH
POOR
I
CONSIDERED
ALL
THE
LIVING
WHICH
WALK
UNDER
THE
SUN
WITH
THE
SECOND
CHILD
THAT
SHALL
STAND
UP
IN
HIS
STEAD
THERE
IS
NO
END
OF
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
EVEN
OF
ALL
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
BEFORE
THEM
THEY
ALSO
THAT
COME
AFTER
SHALL
NOT
REJOICE
IN
HIM
SURELY
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
KEEP
THY
FOOT
WHEN
THOU
GOEST
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
AND
BE
MORE
READY
TO
HEAR
THAN
TO
GIVE
THE
SACRIFICE
OF
FOOLS
FOR
THEY
CONSIDER
NOT
THAT
THEY
DO
EVIL
BE
NOT
RASH
WITH
THY
MOUTH
AND
LET
NOT
THINE
HEART
BE
HASTY
TO
UTTER
ANY
THING
BEFORE
GOD
FOR
GOD
IS
IN
HEAVEN
AND
THOU
UPON
EARTH
THEREFORE
LET
THY
WORDS
BE
FEW
FOR
A
DREAM
COMETH
THROUGH
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
BUSINESS
AND
A
FOOL'S
VOICE
IS
KNOWN
BY
MULTITUDE
OF
WORDS
WHEN
THOU
VOWEST
A
VOW
UNTO
GOD
DEFER
NOT
TO
PAY
IT
FOR
HE
HATH
NO
PLEASURE
IN
FOOLS
PAY
THAT
WHICH
THOU
HAST
VOWED
BETTER
IS
IT
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
NOT
VOW
THAN
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
VOW
AND
NOT
PAY
SUFFER
NOT
THY
MOUTH
TO
CAUSE
THY
FLESH
TO
SIN
NEITHER
SAY
THOU
BEFORE
THE
ANGEL
THAT
IT
WAS
AN
ERROR
WHEREFORE
SHOULD
GOD
BE
ANGRY
AT
THY
VOICE
AND
DESTROY
THE
WORK
OF
THINE
HANDS
FOR
IN
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
DREAMS
AND
MANY
WORDS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DIVERS
VANITIES
BUT
FEAR
THOU
GOD
IF
THOU
SEEST
THE
OPPRESSION
OF
THE
POOR
AND
VIOLENT
PERVERTING
OF
JUDGMENT
AND
JUSTICE
IN
A
PROVINCE
MARVEL
NOT
AT
THE
MATTER
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
HIGHER
THAN
THE
HIGHEST
REGARDETH
AND
THERE
BE
HIGHER
THAN
THEY
MOREOVER
THE
PROFIT
OF
THE
EARTH
IS
FOR
ALL
THE
KING
HIMSELF
IS
SERVED
BY
THE
FIELD
HE
THAT
LOVETH
SILVER
SHALL
NOT
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
SILVER
NOR
HE
THAT
LOVETH
ABUNDANCE
WITH
INCREASE
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
WHEN
GOODS
INCREASE
THEY
ARE
INCREASED
THAT
EAT
THEM
AND
WHAT
GOOD
IS
THERE
TO
THE
OWNERS
THEREOF
SAVING
THE
BEHOLDING
OF
THEM
WITH
THEIR
EYES
THE
SLEEP
OF
A
LABOURING
MAN
IS
SWEET
WHETHER
HE
EAT
LITTLE
OR
MUCH
BUT
THE
ABUNDANCE
OF
THE
RICH
WILL
NOT
SUFFER
HIM
TO
SLEEP
THERE
IS
A
SORE
EVIL
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
UNDER
THE
SUN
NAMELY
RICHES
KEPT
FOR
THE
OWNERS
THEREOF
TO
THEIR
HURT
BUT
THOSE
RICHES
PERISH
BY
EVIL
TRAVAIL
AND
HE
BEGETTETH
A
SON
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
HIS
HAND
AS
HE
CAME
FORTH
OF
HIS
MOTHER'S
WOMB
NAKED
SHALL
HE
RETURN
TO
GO
AS
HE
CAME
AND
SHALL
TAKE
NOTHING
OF
HIS
LABOUR
WHICH
HE
MAY
CARRY
AWAY
IN
HIS
HAND
AND
THIS
ALSO
IS
A
SORE
EVIL
THAT
IN
ALL
POINTS
AS
HE
CAME
SO
SHALL
HE
GO
AND
WHAT
PROFIT
HATH
HE
THAT
HATH
LABOURED
FOR
THE
WIND
ALL
HIS
DAYS
ALSO
HE
EATETH
IN
DARKNESS
AND
HE
HATH
MUCH
SORROW
AND
WRATH
WITH
HIS
SICKNESS
BEHOLD
THAT
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
IT
IS
GOOD
AND
COMELY
FOR
ONE
TO
EAT
AND
TO
DRINK
AND
TO
ENJOY
THE
GOOD
OF
ALL
HIS
LABOUR
THAT
HE
TAKETH
UNDER
THE
SUN
ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
LIFE
WHICH
GOD
GIVETH
HIM
FOR
IT
IS
HIS
PORTION
EVERY
MAN
ALSO
TO
WHOM
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
RICHES
AND
WEALTH
AND
HATH
GIVEN
HIM
POWER
TO
EAT
THEREOF
AND
TO
TAKE
HIS
PORTION
AND
TO
REJOICE
IN
HIS
LABOUR
THIS
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
FOR
HE
SHALL
NOT
MUCH
REMEMBER
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
LIFE
BECAUSE
GOD
ANSWERETH
HIM
IN
THE
JOY
OF
HIS
HEART
THERE
IS
AN
EVIL
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
UNDER
THE
SUN
AND
IT
IS
COMMON
AMONG
MEN
A
MAN
TO
WHOM
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
RICHES
WEALTH
AND
HONOUR
SO
THAT
HE
WANTETH
NOTHING
FOR
HIS
SOUL
OF
ALL
THAT
HE
DESIRETH
YET
GOD
GIVETH
HIM
NOT
POWER
TO
EAT
THEREOF
BUT
A
STRANGER
EATETH
IT
THIS
IS
VANITY
AND
IT
IS
AN
EVIL
DISEASE
IF
A
MAN
BEGET
AN
HUNDRED
CHILDREN
AND
LIVE
MANY
YEARS
SO
THAT
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
YEARS
BE
MANY
AND
HIS
SOUL
BE
NOT
FILLED
WITH
GOOD
AND
ALSO
THAT
HE
HAVE
NO
BURIAL
I
SAY
THAT
AN
UNTIMELY
BIRTH
IS
BETTER
THAN
HE
FOR
HE
COMETH
IN
WITH
VANITY
AND
DEPARTETH
IN
DARKNESS
AND
HIS
NAME
SHALL
BE
COVERED
WITH
DARKNESS
MOREOVER
HE
HATH
NOT
SEEN
THE
SUN
NOR
KNOWN
ANY
THING
THIS
HATH
MORE
REST
THAN
THE
OTHER
YEA
THOUGH
HE
LIVE
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
TWICE
TOLD
YET
HATH
HE
SEEN
NO
GOOD
DO
NOT
ALL
GO
TO
ONE
PLACE
ALL
THE
LABOUR
OF
MAN
IS
FOR
HIS
MOUTH
AND
YET
THE
APPETITE
IS
NOT
FILLED
FOR
WHAT
HATH
THE
WISE
MORE
THAN
THE
FOOL
WHAT
HATH
THE
POOR
THAT
KNOWETH
TO
WALK
BEFORE
THE
LIVING
BETTER
IS
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
EYES
THAN
THE
WANDERING
OF
THE
DESIRE
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
AND
VEXATION
OF
SPIRIT
THAT
WHICH
HATH
BEEN
IS
NAMED
ALREADY
AND
IT
IS
KNOWN
THAT
IT
IS
MAN
NEITHER
MAY
HE
CONTEND
WITH
HIM
THAT
IS
MIGHTIER
THAN
HE
SEEING
THERE
BE
MANY
THINGS
THAT
INCREASE
VANITY
WHAT
IS
MAN
THE
BETTER
FOR
WHO
KNOWETH
WHAT
IS
GOOD
FOR
MAN
IN
THIS
LIFE
ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
VAIN
LIFE
WHICH
HE
SPENDETH
AS
A
SHADOW
FOR
WHO
CAN
TELL
A
MAN
WHAT
SHALL
BE
AFTER
HIM
UNDER
THE
SUN
A
GOOD
NAME
IS
BETTER
THAN
PRECIOUS
OINTMENT
AND
THE
DAY
OF
DEATH
THAN
THE
DAY
OF
ONE'S
BIRTH
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
GO
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
MOURNING
THAN
TO
GO
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
FEASTING
FOR
THAT
IS
THE
END
OF
ALL
MEN
AND
THE
LIVING
WILL
LAY
IT
TO
HIS
HEART
SORROW
IS
BETTER
THAN
LAUGHTER
FOR
BY
THE
SADNESS
OF
THE
COUNTENANCE
THE
HEART
IS
MADE
BETTER
THE
HEART
OF
THE
WISE
IS
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
MOURNING
BUT
THE
HEART
OF
FOOLS
IS
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
MIRTH
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
HEAR
THE
REBUKE
OF
THE
WISE
THAN
FOR
A
MAN
TO
HEAR
THE
SONG
OF
FOOLS
FOR
AS
THE
CRACKLING
OF
THORNS
UNDER
A
POT
SO
IS
THE
LAUGHTER
OF
THE
FOOL
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
SURELY
OPPRESSION
MAKETH
A
WISE
MAN
MAD
AND
A
GIFT
DESTROYETH
THE
HEART
BETTER
IS
THE
END
OF
A
THING
THAN
THE
BEGINNING
THEREOF
AND
THE
PATIENT
IN
SPIRIT
IS
BETTER
THAN
THE
PROUD
IN
SPIRIT
BE
NOT
HASTY
IN
THY
SPIRIT
TO
BE
ANGRY
FOR
ANGER
RESTETH
IN
THE
BOSOM
OF
FOOLS
SAY
NOT
THOU
WHAT
IS
THE
CAUSE
THAT
THE
FORMER
DAYS
WERE
BETTER
THAN
THESE
FOR
THOU
DOST
NOT
ENQUIRE
WISELY
CONCERNING
THIS
WISDOM
IS
GOOD
WITH
AN
INHERITANCE
AND
BY
IT
THERE
IS
PROFIT
TO
THEM
THAT
SEE
THE
SUN
FOR
WISDOM
IS
A
DEFENCE
AND
MONEY
IS
A
DEFENCE
BUT
THE
EXCELLENCY
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IS
THAT
WISDOM
GIVETH
LIFE
TO
THEM
THAT
HAVE
IT
CONSIDER
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
FOR
WHO
CAN
MAKE
THAT
STRAIGHT
WHICH
HE
HATH
MADE
CROOKED
IN
THE
DAY
OF
PROSPERITY
BE
JOYFUL
BUT
IN
THE
DAY
OF
ADVERSITY
CONSIDER
GOD
ALSO
HATH
SET
THE
ONE
OVER
AGAINST
THE
OTHER
TO
THE
END
THAT
MAN
SHOULD
FIND
NOTHING
AFTER
HIM
ALL
THINGS
HAVE
I
SEEN
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
MY
VANITY
THERE
IS
A
JUST
MAN
THAT
PERISHETH
IN
HIS
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
THERE
IS
A
WICKED
MAN
THAT
PROLONGETH
HIS
LIFE
IN
HIS
WICKEDNESS
BE
NOT
RIGHTEOUS
OVER
MUCH
NEITHER
MAKE
THYSELF
OVER
WISE
WHY
SHOULDEST
THOU
DESTROY
THYSELF
BE
NOT
OVER
MUCH
WICKED
NEITHER
BE
THOU
FOOLISH
WHY
SHOULDEST
THOU
DIE
BEFORE
THY
TIME
IT
IS
GOOD
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
TAKE
HOLD
OF
THIS
YEA
ALSO
FROM
THIS
WITHDRAW
NOT
THINE
HAND
FOR
HE
THAT
FEARETH
GOD
SHALL
COME
FORTH
OF
THEM
ALL
WISDOM
STRENGTHENETH
THE
WISE
MORE
THAN
TEN
MIGHTY
MEN
WHICH
ARE
IN
THE
CITY
FOR
THERE
IS
NOT
A
JUST
MAN
UPON
EARTH
THAT
DOETH
GOOD
AND
SINNETH
NOT
ALSO
TAKE
NO
HEED
UNTO
ALL
WORDS
THAT
ARE
SPOKEN
LEST
THOU
HEAR
THY
SERVANT
CURSE
THEE
FOR
OFTENTIMES
ALSO
THINE
OWN
HEART
KNOWETH
THAT
THOU
THYSELF
LIKEWISE
HAST
CURSED
OTHERS
ALL
THIS
HAVE
I
PROVED
BY
WISDOM
I
SAID
I
WILL
BE
WISE
BUT
IT
WAS
FAR
FROM
ME
THAT
WHICH
IS
FAR
OFF
AND
EXCEEDING
DEEP
WHO
CAN
FIND
IT
OUT
I
APPLIED
MINE
HEART
TO
KNOW
AND
TO
SEARCH
AND
TO
SEEK
OUT
WISDOM
AND
THE
REASON
OF
THINGS
AND
TO
KNOW
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
FOLLY
EVEN
OF
FOOLISHNESS
AND
MADNESS
AND
I
FIND
MORE
BITTER
THAN
DEATH
THE
WOMAN
WHOSE
HEART
IS
SNARES
AND
NETS
AND
HER
HANDS
AS
BANDS
WHOSO
PLEASETH
GOD
SHALL
ESCAPE
FROM
HER
BUT
THE
SINNER
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
BY
HER
BEHOLD
THIS
HAVE
I
FOUND
SAITH
THE
PREACHER
COUNTING
ONE
BY
ONE
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
ACCOUNT
WHICH
YET
MY
SOUL
SEEKETH
BUT
I
FIND
NOT
ONE
MAN
AMONG
A
THOUSAND
HAVE
I
FOUND
BUT
A
WOMAN
AMONG
ALL
THOSE
HAVE
I
NOT
FOUND
LO
THIS
ONLY
HAVE
I
FOUND
THAT
GOD
HATH
MADE
MAN
UPRIGHT
BUT
THEY
HAVE
SOUGHT
OUT
MANY
INVENTIONS
WHO
IS
AS
THE
WISE
MAN
AND
WHO
KNOWETH
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
A
THING
A
MAN'S
WISDOM
MAKETH
HIS
FACE
TO
SHINE
AND
THE
BOLDNESS
OF
HIS
FACE
SHALL
BE
CHANGED
I
COUNSEL
THEE
TO
KEEP
THE
KING'S
COMMANDMENT
AND
THAT
IN
REGARD
OF
THE
OATH
OF
GOD
BE
NOT
HASTY
TO
GO
OUT
OF
HIS
SIGHT
STAND
NOT
IN
AN
EVIL
THING
FOR
HE
DOETH
WHATSOEVER
PLEASETH
HIM
WHERE
THE
WORD
OF
A
KING
IS
THERE
IS
POWER
AND
WHO
MAY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
DOEST
THOU
WHOSO
KEEPETH
THE
COMMANDMENT
SHALL
FEEL
NO
EVIL
THING
AND
A
WISE
MAN'S
HEART
DISCERNETH
BOTH
TIME
AND
JUDGMENT
BECAUSE
TO
EVERY
PURPOSE
THERE
IS
TIME
AND
JUDGMENT
THEREFORE
THE
MISERY
OF
MAN
IS
GREAT
UPON
HIM
FOR
HE
KNOWETH
NOT
THAT
WHICH
SHALL
BE
FOR
WHO
CAN
TELL
HIM
WHEN
IT
SHALL
BE
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
THAT
HATH
POWER
OVER
THE
SPIRIT
TO
RETAIN
THE
SPIRIT
NEITHER
HATH
HE
POWER
IN
THE
DAY
OF
DEATH
AND
THERE
IS
NO
DISCHARGE
IN
THAT
WAR
NEITHER
SHALL
WICKEDNESS
DELIVER
THOSE
THAT
ARE
GIVEN
TO
IT
ALL
THIS
HAVE
I
SEEN
AND
APPLIED
MY
HEART
UNTO
EVERY
WORK
THAT
IS
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
THERE
IS
A
TIME
WHEREIN
ONE
MAN
RULETH
OVER
ANOTHER
TO
HIS
OWN
HURT
AND
SO
I
SAW
THE
WICKED
BURIED
WHO
HAD
COME
AND
GONE
FROM
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
HOLY
AND
THEY
WERE
FORGOTTEN
IN
THE
CITY
WHERE
THEY
HAD
SO
DONE
THIS
IS
ALSO
VANITY
BECAUSE
SENTENCE
AGAINST
AN
EVIL
WORK
IS
NOT
EXECUTED
SPEEDILY
THEREFORE
THE
HEART
OF
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
IS
FULLY
SET
IN
THEM
TO
DO
EVIL
THOUGH
A
SINNER
DO
EVIL
AN
HUNDRED
TIMES
AND
HIS
DAYS
BE
PROLONGED
YET
SURELY
I
KNOW
THAT
IT
SHALL
BE
WELL
WITH
THEM
THAT
FEAR
GOD
WHICH
FEAR
BEFORE
HIM
BUT
IT
SHALL
NOT
BE
WELL
WITH
THE
WICKED
NEITHER
SHALL
HE
PROLONG
HIS
DAYS
WHICH
ARE
AS
A
SHADOW
BECAUSE
HE
FEARETH
NOT
BEFORE
GOD
THERE
IS
A
VANITY
WHICH
IS
DONE
UPON
THE
EARTH
THAT
THERE
BE
JUST
MEN
UNTO
WHOM
IT
HAPPENETH
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WORK
OF
THE
WICKED
AGAIN
THERE
BE
WICKED
MEN
TO
WHOM
IT
HAPPENETH
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WORK
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
I
SAID
THAT
THIS
ALSO
IS
VANITY
THEN
I
COMMENDED
MIRTH
BECAUSE
A
MAN
HATH
NO
BETTER
THING
UNDER
THE
SUN
THAN
TO
EAT
AND
TO
DRINK
AND
TO
BE
MERRY
FOR
THAT
SHALL
ABIDE
WITH
HIM
OF
HIS
LABOUR
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
LIFE
WHICH
GOD
GIVETH
HIM
UNDER
THE
SUN
WHEN
I
APPLIED
MINE
HEART
TO
KNOW
WISDOM
AND
TO
SEE
THE
BUSINESS
THAT
IS
DONE
UPON
THE
EARTH
FOR
ALSO
THERE
IS
THAT
NEITHER
DAY
NOR
NIGHT
SEETH
SLEEP
WITH
HIS
EYES
THEN
I
BEHELD
ALL
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
THAT
A
MAN
CANNOT
FIND
OUT
THE
WORK
THAT
IS
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
BECAUSE
THOUGH
A
MAN
LABOUR
TO
SEEK
IT
OUT
YET
HE
SHALL
NOT
FIND
IT
YEA
FARTHER
THOUGH
A
WISE
MAN
THINK
TO
KNOW
IT
YET
SHALL
HE
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
FIND
IT
FOR
ALL
THIS
I
CONSIDERED
IN
MY
HEART
EVEN
TO
DECLARE
ALL
THIS
THAT
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AND
THE
WISE
AND
THEIR
WORKS
ARE
IN
THE
HAND
OF
GOD
NO
MAN
KNOWETH
EITHER
LOVE
OR
HATRED
BY
ALL
THAT
IS
BEFORE
THEM
ALL
THINGS
COME
ALIKE
TO
ALL
THERE
IS
ONE
EVENT
TO
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AND
TO
THE
WICKED
TO
THE
GOOD
AND
TO
THE
CLEAN
AND
TO
THE
UNCLEAN
TO
HIM
THAT
SACRIFICETH
AND
TO
HIM
THAT
SACRIFICETH
NOT
AS
IS
THE
GOOD
SO
IS
THE
SINNER
AND
HE
THAT
SWEARETH
AS
HE
THAT
FEARETH
AN
OATH
THIS
IS
AN
EVIL
AMONG
ALL
THINGS
THAT
ARE
DONE
UNDER
THE
SUN
THAT
THERE
IS
ONE
EVENT
UNTO
ALL
YEA
ALSO
THE
HEART
OF
THE
SONS
OF

IS
FULL
OF
EVIL
AND
MADNESS
IS
IN
THEIR

WHILE
THEY
LIVE
AND
AFTER
THAT
THEY
GO
TO
THE
DEAD
FOR
TO
HIM
THAT
IS
JOINED
TO
ALL
THE
LIVING
THERE
IS
HOPE
FOR
A
LIVING
DOG
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
DEAD
LION
FOR
THE

KNOW
THAT
THEY

DIE
BUT
THE
DEAD
KNOW
NOT
ANY

NEITHER
HAVE
THEY
ANY
MORE
A
REWARD
FOR
THE
MEMORY
OF
THEM
IS
FORGOTTEN
ALSO
THEIR

AND
THEIR

AND
THEIR

IS
NOW
PERISHED
NEITHER

ANY

A

GO

ALL

WHICH
THOU
TAKEST
UNDER

WHATSOEVER
THY

FOR
THERE
IS
NO

NOR
KNOWLEDGE

WISDOM
IN

GRAVE
WHITHER
THOU
GOEST
I
RETURNED
AND
SAW
UNDER

SUN
THAT
THE
RACE
IS
NOT

NOR
THE

TO
THE

NEITHER

BREAD
TO

NOR

TO

TO

OF
SKILL
BUT
TIME
AND
CHANCE
HAPPENETH
TO
THEM
ALL
FOR
MAN
ALSO
KNOWETH
NOT
HIS
TIME
AS
THE
FISHES
THAT
ARE
TAKEN
IN
AN
EVIL
NET
AND
AS
THE
BIRDS
THAT
ARE
CAUGHT
IN
THE
SNARE
SO
ARE
THE
SONS
OF
MEN
SNARED
IN
AN
EVIL
TIME
WHEN
IT
FALLETH
SUDDENLY
UPON
THEM
THIS
WISDOM
HAVE
I
SEEN
ALSO
UNDER
THE
SUN
AND
IT
SEEMED
GREAT
UNTO
ME
THERE
WAS
A
LITTLE
CITY
AND
FEW
MEN
WITHIN
IT
AND
THERE
CAME
A
GREAT
KING
AGAINST
IT
AND
BESIEGED
IT
AND
BUILT
GREAT
BULWARKS
AGAINST
IT
NOW
THERE
WAS
FOUND
IN
IT
A
POOR
WISE
MAN
AND
HE
BY
HIS
WISDOM
DELIVERED
THE
CITY
YET
NO
MAN
REMEMBERED
THAT
SAME
POOR
MAN
THEN
SAID
I
WISDOM
IS
BETTER
THAN
STRENGTH
NEVERTHELESS
THE
POOR
MAN'S
WISDOM
IS
DESPISED
AND
HIS
WORDS
ARE
NOT
HEARD
THE
WORDS
OF
WISE
MEN
ARE
HEARD
IN
QUIET
MORE
THAN
THE
CRY
OF
HIM
THAT
RULETH
AMONG
FOOLS
WISDOM
IS
BETTER
THAN
WEAPONS
OF
WAR
BUT
ONE
SINNER
DESTROYETH
MUCH
GOOD
DEAD
FLIES
CAUSE
THE
OINTMENT
OF
THE
APOTHECARY
TO
SEND
FORTH
A
STINKING
SAVOUR
SO
DOTH
A
LITTLE
FOLLY
HIM
THAT
IS
IN
REPUTATION
FOR
WISDOM
AND
HONOUR
A
WISE
MAN'S
HEART
IS
AT
HIS
RIGHT
HAND
BUT
A
FOOL'S
HEART
AT
HIS
LEFT
YEA
ALSO
WHEN
HE
THAT
IS
A
FOOL
WALKETH
BY
THE
WAY
HIS
WISDOM
FAILETH
HIM
AND
HE
SAITH
TO
EVERY
ONE
THAT
HE
IS
A
FOOL
IF
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
RULER
RISE
UP
AGAINST
THEE
LEAVE
NOT
THY
PLACE
FOR
YIELDING
PACIFIETH
GREAT
OFFENCES
THERE
IS
AN
EVIL
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
UNDER
THE
SUN
AS
AN
ERROR
WHICH
PROCEEDETH
FROM
THE
RULER
FOLLY
IS
SET
IN
GREAT
DIGNITY
AND
THE
RICH
SIT
IN
LOW
PLACE
I
HAVE
SEEN
SERVANTS
UPON
HORSES
AND
PRINCES
WALKING
AS
SERVANTS
UPON
THE
EARTH
HE
THAT
DIGGETH
A
PIT
SHALL
FALL
INTO
IT
AND
WHOSO
BREAKETH
AN
HEDGE
A
SERPENT
SHALL
BITE
HIM
WHOSO
REMOVETH
STONES
SHALL
BE
HURT
THEREWITH
AND
HE
THAT
CLEAVETH
WOOD
SHALL
BE
ENDANGERED
THEREBY
IF
THE
IRON
BE
BLUNT
AND
HE
DO
NOT
WHET
THE
EDGE
THEN
MUST
HE
PUT
TO
MORE
STRENGTH
BUT
WISDOM
IS
PROFITABLE
TO
DIRECT
SURELY
THE
SERPENT
WILL
BITE
WITHOUT
ENCHANTMENT
AND
A
BABBLER
IS
NO
BETTER
THE
WORDS
OF
A
WISE
MAN'S
MOUTH
ARE
GRACIOUS
BUT
THE
LIPS
OF
A
FOOL
WILL
SWALLOW
UP
HIMSELF
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
WORDS
OF
HIS
MOUTH
IS
FOOLISHNESS
AND
THE
END
OF
HIS
TALK
IS
MISCHIEVOUS
MADNESS
A
FOOL
ALSO
IS
FULL
OF
WORDS
A
MAN
CANNOT
TELL
WHAT
SHALL
BE
AND
WHAT
SHALL
BE
AFTER
HIM
WHO
CAN
TELL
HIM
THE
LABOUR
OF
THE
FOOLISH
WEARIETH
EVERY
ONE
OF
THEM
BECAUSE
HE
KNOWETH
NOT
HOW
TO
GO
TO
THE

WOE
TO
THEE
O

WHEN
THY

IS
A

BY

SLOTHFULNESS
THE

THE

DROPPETH

ALL

CURSE
NOT
THE

NO

BECAUSE

TOUCHING
HIS

MY

HATH
A
VINEYARD
IN
A
VERY
FRUITFUL
HILL
AND
HE
FENCED
IT
AND
GATHERED
OUT
THE
STONES
THEREOF
AND
PLANTED
IT
WITH
THE
CHOICEST
VINE
AND
BUILT
A
TOWER
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
IT
AND
ALSO
MADE
A
WINEPRESS
THEREIN
AND
HE
LOOKED
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BRING
FORTH
GRAPES
AND
IT
BROUGHT
FORTH
WILD
GRAPES
AND
NOW
O
INHABITANTS
OF
JERUSALEM
AND
MEN
OF
JUDAH
JUDGE
I
PRAY
YOU
BETWIXT
ME
AND
MY
VINEYARD
WHAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
MORE
TO
MY
VINEYARD
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
DONE
IN

WHEREFORE
WHEN
I
LOOKED
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BRING
FORTH
GRAPES
BROUGHT
IT
FORTH
WILD
GRAPES

NOW
GO
TO
I
WILL
TELL
YOU
WHAT
I
WILL
DO
TO

I
WILL
TAKE
AWAY
THE
HEDGE
THEREOF
AND
IT
SHALL
BE
EATEN
UP

BREAK
DOWN
THE

THEREOF
AND
IT
SHALL
BE
TRODDEN
DOWN
AND
I
WILL
LAY
IT
WASTE
IT
SHALL
NOT
BE
PRUNED
NOR
DIGGED
BUT
THERE
SHALL
COME
UP
BRIERS
AND
THORNS
I
WILL
ALSO
COMMAND
THE

THAT
THEY
RAIN
NO
RAIN
UPON
IT
FOR
THE
VINEYARD
OF
THE
LORD
OF
HOSTS
IS
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
AND
THE
MEN
OF
JUDAH
HIS
PLEASANT

LOOKED
FOR

WITHOUT

YEA
TEN

SHALL
YIELD
AN

UNTO

THAT
RISE
UP

THEREFORE
AS

CONSUMETH
THE

SO
THEIR

BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
CAST
AWAY
THE
LAW
OF
THE
LORD
OF

AND
DESPISED
THE

OF
THE
HOLY

OF

THEREFORE
IS
THE

KINDLED
AGAINST

AND
HE
HATH
STRETCHED
FORTH
HIS

WHOSE

IN
THE
FIRMAMENT
THAT
WAS
ABOVE
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
CHERUBIMS
THERE
APPEARED
OVER
THEM
AS

WERE
A
SAPPHIRE
STONE
AS
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
LIKENESS
OF
A
THRONE
AND
HE
SPAKE
UNTO
THE
MAN
CLOTHED
WITH
LINEN
AND
SAID
GO
IN
BETWEEN

WHEELS
EVEN
UNDER

CHERUB
AND

WITH
COALS
OF
FIRE
FROM

WENT
UP
FROM

AND
STOOD
OVER
THE
THRESHOLD
OF

WAS
FILLED
WITH
THE

WAS
FULL
OF
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
THE
LORD'S
GLORY
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
CHERUBIMS'
WINGS
WAS
HEARD
EVEN
TO
THE
OUTER
COURT
AS
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
ALMIGHTY
GOD
WHEN
HE
SPEAKETH
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN

HAD
COMMANDED
THE
MAN
CLOTHED
WITH
LINEN
SAYING
TAKE
FIRE
FROM
BETWEEN
THE
WHEELS
FROM
BETWEEN

THEN
HE
WENT
IN
AND
STOOD
BESIDE
THE
WHEELS
AND
ONE
CHERUB
STRETCHED
FORTH
HIS
HAND
FROM
BETWEEN
THE
CHERUBIMS
UNTO
THE
FIRE
THAT
WAS
BETWEEN
THE

HAD
ONE
LIKENESS

WHAT
IS
THY
MOTHER
A
LIONESS
SHE
LAY
DOWN
AMONG
LIONS
SHE
NOURISHED
HER
WHELPS
AMONG
YOUNG
LIONS
AND
SHE
BROUGHT
UP
ONE
OF
HER
WHELPS
IT
BECAME
A
YOUNG
LION
AND
IT
LEARNED
TO
CATCH
THE
PREY
IT
DEVOURED
MEN
THE
NATIONS
ALSO
HEARD
OF
HIM
HE
WAS
TAKEN
IN
THEIR
PIT
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
HIM
WITH
CHAINS
UNTO
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
NOW
WHEN
SHE
SAW
THAT
SHE
HAD
WAITED
AND
HER
HOPE
WAS
LOST
THEN
SHE
TOOK
ANOTHER
OF
HER
WHELPS
AND
MADE
HIM
A
YOUNG
LION
AND
HE
WENT
UP
AND
DOWN
AMONG
THE
LIONS
HE
BECAME
A
YOUNG
LION
AND
LEARNED
TO
CATCH
THE
PREY
AND
DEVOURED
MEN
AND
HE
KNEW
THEIR
DESOLATE
PALACES
AND
HE
LAID
WASTE
THEIR
CITIES
AND
THE
LAND
WAS
DESOLATE
AND
THE
FULNESS
THEREOF
BY
THE
NOISE
OF
HIS
ROARING
THEN
THE
NATIONS
SET
AGAINST
HIM
ON
EVERY
SIDE
FROM
THE
PROVINCES
AND
SPREAD
THEIR
NET
OVER
HIM
HE
WAS
TAKEN
IN
THEIR
PIT
AND
THEY
PUT
HIM
IN
WARD
IN
CHAINS
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
THE

BROUGHT
HIM
INTO
HOLDS
THAT
HIS
VOICE
SHOULD
NO

BE
HEARD
UPON
THE
MOUNTAINS
OF

THY
MOTHER
IS
LIKE
A
VINE
IN
THY
BLOOD
PLANTED
BY
THE
WATERS
SHE
WAS
FRUITFUL
AND
FULL
OF
BRANCHES
BY
REASON
OF
MANY
WATERS
AND
SHE
HAD
STRONG
RODS
FOR
THE
SCEPTRES
OF
THEM
THAT
BARE
RULE
AND
HER
STATURE
WAS
EXALTED
AMONG
THE
THICK
BRANCHES
AND
SHE
APPEARED
IN
HER
HEIGHT
WITH
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
HER
BRANCHES
BUT
SHE
WAS
PLUCKED
UP
IN
FURY
SHE
WAS
CAST
DOWN
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
THE
EAST
WIND
DRIED
UP
HER
FRUIT
HER
STRONG
RODS
WERE
BROKEN
AND
WITHERED
THE
FIRE
CONSUMED
THEM
AND
NOW
SHE
IS
PLANTED
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
IN
A
DRY
AND
THIRSTY
GROUND
AND
FIRE
IS
GONE
OUT
OF
A
ROD
OF
HER
BRANCHES
WHICH
HATH
DEVOURED
HER
FRUIT
SO
THAT
SHE
HATH
NO
STRONG
ROD
TO
BE
A
SCEPTRE
TO
RULE
THIS
IS
A
LAMENTATION
AND
SHALL
BE
FOR

HE
FOUND

AND
ASTROLOGERS
THAT
WERE
IN
ALL

AND
DANIEL
CONTINUED
EVEN
UNTO
THE

NEBUCHADNEZZAR
DREAMED
DREAMS
WHEREWITH
HIS

WAS
TROUBLED
AND
HIS

BRAKE
FROM

THEN
THE

COMMANDED
TO
CALL
THE
MAGICIANS
AND
THE
ASTROLOGERS
AND
THE
SORCERERS
AND
THE
CHALDEANS
FOR
TO
SHEW
THE
KING
HIS

SO
THEY
CAME
AND
STOOD
BEFORE
THE

AND
THE
KING
SAID
UNTO
THEM
I
HAVE
DREAMED
A
DREAM
AND
MY
SPIRIT
WAS
TROUBLED
TO
KNOW
THE
DREAM
THEN
SPAKE
THE
CHALDEANS
TO
THE
KING
IN
SYRIACK
O
KING
LIVE
FOR
EVER
TELL
THY
SERVANTS
THE
DREAM
AND
WE
WILL
SHEW
THE
INTERPRETATION
THE
KING
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
TO
THE
CHALDEANS
THE
THING
IS
GONE
FROM
ME
IF
YE
WILL
NOT
MAKE
KNOWN
UNTO

THE
DREAM
WITH
THE
INTERPRETATION
THEREOF
YE
SHALL
BE
CUT
IN

AND
YOUR

SHALL
BE
MADE
A
DUNGHILL
BUT
IF

THE

THAT

WOULD
GAIN
THE
TIME
BECAUSE

SEE
THE

DECREE
FOR

FOR

HAVE
PREPARED
LYING

ANSWERED
BEFORE
THE
KING
AND
SAID
THERE
IS
NOT
A
MAN
UPON
THE
EARTH
THAT

THEREFORE
THERE
IS
NO
KING
LORD
NOR
RULER
THAT
ASKED
SUCH
THINGS
AT
ANY
MAGICIAN
OR
ASTROLOGER
OR
CHALDEAN
AND
IT
IS
A
RARE
THING
THAT
THE
KING
REQUIRETH
AND
THERE
IS
NONE
OTHER
THAT
CAN
SHEW
IT
BEFORE
THE
KING
EXCEPT
THE
GODS
WHOSE
DWELLING

FOR

CAUSE
THE

WAS
ANGRY

HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
TO

FROM

THEN
ARIOCH
MADE

THEN
DANIEL
WENT
IN
AND
DESIRED
OF
THE
KING
THAT
HE
WOULD
GIVE
HIM
TIME
AND
THAT
HE
WOULD
SHEW
THE
KING
THE
INTERPRETATION
THEN
DANIEL
WENT
TO
HIS
HOUSE
AND
MADE
THE
THING
KNOWN
TO
HANANIAH
MISHAEL
AND
AZARIAH
HIS

THAT
THEY

TILL
THE
WINGS
THEREOF
WERE
PLUCKED
AND
IT
WAS
LIFTED
UP
FROM
THE
EARTH
AND
MADE
STAND
UPON
THE
FEET
AS
A
MAN
AND
A
MAN'S
HEART
WAS
GIVEN
TO
IT
AND
BEHOLD
ANOTHER
BEAST
A
SECOND
LIKE
TO
A
BEAR
AND
IT
RAISED
UP
ITSELF
ON
ONE
SIDE
AND
IT
HAD
THREE
RIBS
IN
THE
MOUTH
OF
IT
BETWEEN
THE
TEETH
OF
IT

UNTO
IT
ARISE

FOUR
WINGS
OF
A
FOWL
THE
BEAST

FOUR
HEADS
AND
DOMINION
WAS
GIVEN
TO
IT
AFTER
THIS
I
SAW
IN
THE
NIGHT
VISIONS
AND
BEHOLD
A
FOURTH
BEAST
DREADFUL
AND
TERRIBLE
AND
STRONG
EXCEEDINGLY
AND
IT
HAD
GREAT
IRON
TEETH
IT
DEVOURED
AND
BRAKE
IN
PIECES
AND
STAMPED
THE
RESIDUE
WITH
THE
FEET
OF
IT
AND
IT
WAS
DIVERSE
FROM
ALL
THE
BEASTS
THAT
WERE
BEFORE
IT
AND
IT
HAD
TEN
HORNS
I
CONSIDERED
THE
HORNS
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
CAME
UP
AMONG
THEM
ANOTHER
LITTLE
HORN
BEFORE
WHOM
THERE
WERE
THREE
OF
THE
FIRST
HORNS
PLUCKED
UP
BY
THE
ROOTS
AND
BEHOLD
IN
THIS
HORN
WERE
EYES
LIKE
THE
EYES
OF
MAN
AND
A
MOUTH
SPEAKING
GREAT
THINGS
I
BEHELD
TILL
THE
THRONES
WERE
CAST
DOWN
AND
THE
ANCIENT
OF
DAYS
DID
SIT
WHOSE
GARMENT
WAS
WHITE
AS
SNOW
AND
THE
HAIR
OF
HIS
HEAD
LIKE
THE
PURE
WOOL
HIS
THRONE
WAS
LIKE
THE
FIERY
FLAME
AND
HIS
WHEELS
AS
BURNING
FIRE
A
FIERY
STREAM
ISSUED
AND
CAME
FORTH
FROM
BEFORE

THOUSAND
THOUSANDS
MINISTERED
UNTO
HIM
AND
TEN
THOUSAND
TIMES
TEN
THOUSAND
STOOD
BEFORE
HIM
THE
JUDGMENT
WAS
SET
AND
THE
BOOKS
WERE
OPENED
I
BEHELD
THEN
BECAUSE
OF
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
GREAT
WORDS
WHICH
THE
HORN
SPAKE
I
BEHELD
EVEN
TILL
THE
BEAST
WAS
SLAIN
AND
HIS
BODY
DESTROYED
AND
GIVEN
TO
THE
BURNING
FLAME
AS
CONCERNING
THE
REST
OF
THE
BEASTS
THEY
HAD
THEIR
DOMINION
TAKEN
AWAY
YET
THEIR
LIVES
WERE
PROLONGED
FOR
A
SEASON
AND
TIME
I
SAW
IN
THE
NIGHT
VISIONS
AND
BEHOLD
ONE
LIKE
THE
SON
OF
MAN
CAME
WITH
THE
CLOUDS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
CAME
TO
THE
ANCIENT
OF
DAYS
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
HIM
NEAR
BEFORE
HIM
AND
THERE
WAS
GIVEN
HIM
DOMINION
AND
GLORY
AND
A
KINGDOM
THAT
ALL
PEOPLE
NATIONS
AND
LANGUAGES
SHOULD
SERVE
HIM
HIS
DOMINION
IS
AN
EVERLASTING
DOMINION
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
PASS
AWAY
AND
HIS
KINGDOM
THAT
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
BE
DESTROYED
I
DANIEL
WAS
GRIEVED
IN
MY
SPIRIT
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
MY
BODY
AND
THE
VISIONS
OF
MY
HEAD
TROUBLED
ME
I
CAME
NEAR
UNTO
ONE
OF
THEM
THAT
STOOD
BY
AND
ASKED
HIM
THE
TRUTH
OF
ALL
THIS
SO
HE
TOLD
ME
AND
MADE
ME
KNOW
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
THINGS
THESE
GREAT
BEASTS
WHICH
ARE
FOUR
ARE
FOUR
KINGS
WHICH
SHALL
ARISE
OUT
OF
THE
EARTH
BUT
THE
SAINTS
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
SHALL
TAKE
THE
KINGDOM
AND
POSSESS
THE
KINGDOM
FOR
EVER
EVEN
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER
THEN
I
WOULD
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
FOURTH
BEAST
WHICH
WAS
DIVERSE
FROM
ALL
THE
OTHERS
EXCEEDING
DREADFUL
WHOSE
TEETH
WERE
OF
IRON
AND
HIS
NAILS
OF
BRASS
WHICH
DEVOURED
BRAKE
IN
PIECES
AND
STAMPED
THE
RESIDUE
WITH
HIS
FEET
AND
OF
THE
TEN
HORNS
THAT
WERE
IN
HIS
HEAD
AND
OF
THE
OTHER
WHICH
CAME
UP
AND
BEFORE
WHOM
THREE
FELL
EVEN
OF
THAT
HORN
THAT
HAD
EYES
AND
A
MOUTH
THAT
SPAKE
VERY
GREAT
THINGS
WHOSE
LOOK
WAS
MORE
STOUT
THAN
HIS
FELLOWS
I
BEHELD
AND
THE
SAME
HORN
MADE
WAR
WITH
THE
SAINTS
AND
PREVAILED
AGAINST
THEM
UNTIL
THE
ANCIENT
OF
DAYS
CAME
AND
JUDGMENT
WAS
GIVEN
TO
THE
SAINTS
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
AND
THE
TIME
CAME
THAT
THE
SAINTS
POSSESSED
THE
KINGDOM
THUS
HE
SAID
THE
FOURTH
BEAST
SHALL
BE
THE
FOURTH
KINGDOM
UPON
EARTH
WHICH
SHALL
BE
DIVERSE
FROM
ALL
KINGDOMS
AND
SHALL
DEVOUR
THE
WHOLE
EARTH
AND
SHALL
TREAD
IT
DOWN
AND
BREAK
IT
IN
PIECES
AND
THE
TEN
HORNS
OUT
OF
THIS
KINGDOM
ARE
TEN
KINGS
THAT
SHALL
ARISE
AND
ANOTHER
SHALL
RISE
AFTER
THEM
AND
HE
SHALL
BE
DIVERSE
FROM
THE
FIRST
AND
HE
SHALL
SUBDUE
THREE
KINGS
AND
HE
SHALL
SPEAK
GREAT
WORDS
AGAINST
THE
MOST
HIGH
AND
SHALL
WEAR
OUT
THE
SAINTS
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
AND
THINK
TO
CHANGE
TIMES
AND
LAWS
AND
THEY
SHALL
BE
GIVEN
INTO
HIS
HAND
UNTIL
A
TIME
AND
TIMES
AND
THE
DIVIDING
OF
TIME
BUT
THE
JUDGMENT
SHALL
SIT
AND
THEY
SHALL
TAKE
AWAY
HIS
DOMINION
TO
CONSUME
AND
TO
DESTROY
IT
UNTO
THE
END
AND
THE
KINGDOM
AND
DOMINION
AND
THE
GREATNESS
OF
THE
KINGDOM
UNDER
THE
WHOLE
HEAVEN
SHALL
BE
GIVEN
TO
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
SAINTS
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
WHOSE
KINGDOM
IS
AN
EVERLASTING
KINGDOM
AND
ALL
DOMINIONS
SHALL
SERVE
AND
OBEY
HIM
HITHERTO
IS
THE
END
OF
THE
MATTER
AS
FOR
ME
DANIEL
MY
COGITATIONS
MUCH
TROUBLED
ME
AND
MY
COUNTENANCE
CHANGED
IN
ME
BUT
I
KEPT
THE
MATTER
IN
MY
HEART
IN
THE
THIRD
YEAR
OF
THE
REIGN
OF
KING
BELSHAZZAR
A
VISION
APPEARED
UNTO
ME
EVEN
UNTO
ME
DANIEL
AFTER
THAT
WHICH
APPEARED
UNTO
ME
AT
THE
FIRST
AND
I
SAW
IN
A
VISION
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
I
SAW
THAT
I
WAS
AT
SHUSHAN
IN
THE
PALACE
WHICH
IS
IN
THE
PROVINCE
OF
ELAM
AND
I
SAW
IN
A
VISION
AND
I
WAS
BY
THE
RIVER
OF
ULAI
THEN
I
LIFTED
UP
MINE
EYES
AND
SAW
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
STOOD
BEFORE
THE
RIVER
A
RAM
WHICH
HAD
TWO
HORNS
AND
THE
TWO
HORNS
WERE
HIGH
BUT
ONE
WAS
HIGHER
THAN
THE
OTHER
AND
THE
HIGHER
CAME
UP
LAST
I
SAW
THE
RAM
PUSHING
WESTWARD
AND
NORTHWARD
AND
SOUTHWARD
SO
THAT
NO
BEASTS
MIGHT
STAND
BEFORE
HIM
NEITHER
WAS
THERE
ANY
THAT
COULD
DELIVER
OUT
OF
HIS
HAND
BUT
HE
DID
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
WILL
AND
BECAME
GREAT
AND
AS
I
WAS
CONSIDERING
BEHOLD
AN
HE
GOAT
CAME
FROM
THE
WEST
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
WHOLE
EARTH
AND
TOUCHED
NOT
THE
GROUND
AND
THE
GOAT
HAD
A
NOTABLE
HORN
BETWEEN
HIS
EYES
AND
HE
CAME
TO
THE
RAM
THAT
HAD
TWO
HORNS
WHICH
I
HAD
SEEN
STANDING
BEFORE
THE
RIVER
AND
RAN
UNTO
HIM
IN
THE
FURY
OF
HIS
POWER
AND
I
SAW
HIM
COME
CLOSE
UNTO
THE
RAM
AND
HE
WAS
MOVED
WITH
CHOLER
AGAINST
HIM
AND
SMOTE
THE
RAM
AND
BRAKE
HIS
TWO
HORNS
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
POWER
IN
THE
RAM
TO
STAND
BEFORE
HIM
BUT
HE
CAST
HIM
DOWN
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
STAMPED
UPON
HIM
AND
THERE
WAS
NONE
THAT
COULD
DELIVER
THE
RAM
OUT
OF
HIS
HAND
THEREFORE
THE
HE
GOAT
WAXED
VERY
GREAT
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
STRONG
THE
GREAT
HORN
WAS
BROKEN
AND
FOR
IT
CAME
UP
FOUR
NOTABLE
ONES
TOWARD
THE
FOUR
WINDS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
OUT
OF
ONE
OF
THEM
CAME
FORTH
A
LITTLE
HORN
WHICH
WAXED
EXCEEDING
GREAT
TOWARD
THE
SOUTH
AND
TOWARD
THE
EAST
AND
TOWARD
THE
PLEASANT
LAND
AND
IT
WAXED
GREAT
EVEN
TO
THE
HOST
OF
HEAVEN
AND
IT
CAST
DOWN
SOME
OF
THE
HOST
AND
OF
THE
STARS
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
STAMPED
UPON
THEM
YEA
HE
MAGNIFIED
HIMSELF
EVEN
TO
THE
PRINCE
OF
THE
HOST
AND
BY
HIM
THE
DAILY
SACRIFICE
WAS
TAKEN
AWAY
AND
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
SANCTUARY
WAS
CAST
DOWN
AND
AN
HOST
WAS
GIVEN
HIM
AGAINST
THE
DAILY
SACRIFICE
BY
REASON
OF
TRANSGRESSION
AND
IT
CAST
DOWN
THE
TRUTH
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
IT
PRACTISED
AND
PROSPERED
THEN
I
HEARD
ONE
SAINT
SPEAKING
AND
ANOTHER
SAINT
SAID
UNTO
THAT
CERTAIN
SAINT
WHICH
SPAKE
HOW
LONG
SHALL
BE
THE
VISION
CONCERNING
THE
DAILY
SACRIFICE
AND
THE
TRANSGRESSION
OF
DESOLATION
TO
GIVE
BOTH
THE
SANCTUARY
AND
THE
HOST
TO
BE
TRODDEN
UNDER
FOOT
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
UNTO
TWO
THOUSAND
AND
THREE
HUNDRED
DAYS
THEN
SHALL
THE
SANCTUARY
BE
CLEANSED
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
I
EVEN
I
DANIEL
HAD
SEEN
THE
VISION
AND
SOUGHT
FOR
THE
MEANING
THEN
BEHOLD
THERE
STOOD
BEFORE
ME
AS
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
A
MAN
AND
I
HEARD
A
MAN'S
VOICE
BETWEEN
THE
BANKS
OF
ULAI
WHICH
CALLED
AND
SAID
GABRIEL
MAKE
THIS
MAN
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
VISION
SO
HE
CAME
NEAR
WHERE
I
STOOD
AND
WHEN
HE
CAME
I
WAS
AFRAID
AND
FELL
UPON
MY
FACE
BUT
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
UNDERSTAND
O
SON
OF
MAN
FOR
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
END
SHALL
BE
THE
VISION
NOW
AS
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
WITH
ME
I
WAS
IN
A
DEEP
SLEEP
ON
MY
FACE
TOWARD
THE
GROUND
BUT
HE
TOUCHED
ME
AND
SET
ME
UPRIGHT
AND
HE
SAID
BEHOLD
I
WILL
MAKE
THEE
KNOW
WHAT
SHALL
BE
IN
THE
LAST
END
OF
THE
INDIGNATION
FOR
AT
THE
TIME
APPOINTED
THE
END
SHALL
BE
THE
RAM
WHICH
THOU
SAWEST
HAVING
TWO
HORNS
ARE
THE
KINGS
OF
MEDIA
AND
PERSIA
AND
THE
ROUGH
GOAT
IS
THE
KING
OF
GRECIA
AND
THE
GREAT
HORN
THAT
IS
BETWEEN
HIS
EYES
IS
THE
FIRST
KING
NOW
THAT
BEING
BROKEN
WHEREAS
FOUR
STOOD
UP
FOR
IT
FOUR
KINGDOMS
SHALL
STAND
UP
OUT
OF
THE
NATION
BUT
NOT
IN
HIS
POWER
AND
IN
THE
LATTER
TIME
OF
THEIR
KINGDOM
WHEN
THE
TRANSGRESSORS
ARE
COME
TO
THE
FULL
A
KING
OF
FIERCE
COUNTENANCE
AND
UNDERSTANDING
DARK
SENTENCES
SHALL
STAND
UP
AND
HIS
POWER
SHALL
BE
MIGHTY
BUT
NOT
BY
HIS
OWN
POWER
AND
HE
SHALL
DESTROY
WONDERFULLY
AND
SHALL
PROSPER
AND
PRACTISE
AND
SHALL
DESTROY
THE
MIGHTY
AND
THE
HOLY
PEOPLE
AND
THROUGH
HIS
POLICY

OF
FIRE
AND
HIS

QUAKING
FELL
UPON

EPHRAIM

WHEN

FOR

I
EVEN

I

HIS

OFF
WHEN
ISRAEL
WAS

SHALL
ABIDE
ON

AND
SHALL
CONSUME
HIS

AND
DEVOUR
THEM
BECAUSE

FROM

THEREOF
AND
WENT
DOWN
INTO
IT
TO
GO
WITH
THEM
UNTO
TARSHISH
FROM
THE
PRESENCE

BUT
THE

SENT
OUT
A
GREAT
WIND
INTO

SEA
AND
THERE
WAS
A
MIGHTY
TEMPEST
IN
THE
SEA
SO
THAT
THE
SHIP
WAS
LIKE

BROKEN
THEN
THE
MARINERS
WERE
AFRAID

CRIED
EVERY
MAN
UNTO
HIS
GOD
AND
CAST
FORTH
THE
WARES
THAT
WERE
IN
THE
SHIP
INTO
THE
SEA
TO
LIGHTEN
IT
OF
THEM
BUT
JONAH
WAS
GONE
DOWN
INTO
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
SHIP
AND
HE
LAY
AND
WAS
FAST
ASLEEP
SO
THE
SHIPMASTER
CAME
TO
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
MEANEST
THOU
O
SLEEPER
ARISE
CALL
UPON
THY
GOD
IF
SO
BE
THAT
GOD
WILL
THINK
UPON

THAT

THEY
SAID
EVERY

TO
HIS
FELLOW
COME
AND
LET
US
CAST
LOTS
THAT
WE
MAY
KNOW
FOR
WHOSE
CAUSE
THIS
EVIL
IS
UPON
US
SO
THEY
CAST
LOTS
AND
THE
LOT
FELL
UPON
JONAH
THEN
SAID
THEY
UNTO
HIM
TELL
US
WE
PRAY
THEE
FOR

CAUSE
THIS
EVIL
IS

WHAT

THINE
OCCUPATION

AND
I
FEAR
THE
LORD
THE
GOD
OF
HEAVEN
WHICH
HATH
MADE
THE
SEA

THEN
WERE
THE
MEN
EXCEEDINGLY
AFRAID
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHY
HAST
THOU
DONE
THIS
FOR
THE
MEN
KNEW
THAT
HE
FLED
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LORD
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
TOLD
THEM
THEN
SAID
THEY
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
SHALL
WE
DO
UNTO
THEE
THAT
THE
SEA
MAY
BE
CALM
UNTO
US
FOR
THE

WROUGHT
AND
WAS
TEMPESTUOUS
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
TAKE
ME
UP
AND
CAST

FORTH
INTO

SO
SHALL
THE
SEA
BE
CALM
UNTO
YOU
FOR

KNOW
THAT
FOR

THIS
GREAT
TEMPEST
IS
UPON
YOU
NEVERTHELESS
THE
MEN

HARD
TO
BRING
IT
TO

LAND
BUT
THEY
COULD
NOT

WHEREFORE
THEY
CRIED
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
SAID

LIFE
AND
LAY

INNOCENT
BLOOD
FOR

O
LORD
HAST
DONE
AS

PLEASED
THEE
SO
THEY
LOOK
UP
JONAH
AND
CAST
HIM
FORTH
INTO
THE
SEA
AND
THE
SEA
CEASED
FROM
HER
RAGING
THEN
THE
MEN
FEARED
THE
LORD
EXCEEDINGLY
AND
OFFERED
A
SACRIFICE
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
MADE
VOWS
NOW
THE
LORD
HAD
PREPARED
A
GREAT
FISH
TO
SWALLOW
UP
JONAH
AND
JONAH
WAS
IN
THE
BELLY
OF
THE
FISH
THREE
DAYS
AND
THREE
NIGHTS
THEN
JONAH
PRAYED
UNTO
THE
LORD
HIS
GOD
OUT
OF
THE
FISH'S
BELLY
AND
SAID
I
CRIED
BY
REASON
OF
MINE
AFFLICTION
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
HE
HEARD
ME
OUT
OF
THE
BELLY
OF

AND
THOU
HEARDEST
MY

THEY

SPAKE
UNTO

JONAH
AROSE
AND
WENT

NINEVEH
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WORD
OF

NOW
NINEVEH
WAS
AN
EXCEEDING
GREAT
CITY
OF
THREE
DAYS'
JOURNEY
AND
JONAH
BEGAN
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
CITY
A
DAY'S
JOURNEY
AND
HE
CRIED
AND
SAID
YET
FORTY
DAYS
AND
NINEVEH
SHALL
BE
OVERTHROWN
SO
THE
PEOPLE
OF

BELIEVED
GOD
AND
PROCLAIMED
A
FAST
AND
PUT
ON
SACKCLOTH
FROM
THE
GREATEST
OF
THEM
EVEN
TO
THE
LEAST
OF
THEM
FOR
WORD
CAME
UNTO
THE
KING
OF
NINEVEH
AND
HE
AROSE
FROM
HIS
THRONE
AND
HE
LAID
HIS
ROBE
FROM
HIM
AND
COVERED
HIM
WITH
SACKCLOTH
AND
SAT
IN
ASHES
AND
HE
CAUSED
IT
TO
BE
PROCLAIMED
AND
PUBLISHED
THROUGH
NINEVEH
BY
THE
DECREE
OF
THE
KING
AND
HIS
NOBLES
SAYING
LET
NEITHER
MAN
NOR
BEAST
HERD
NOR
FLOCK
TASTE
ANY
THING
LET
THEM
NOT
FEED
NOR
DRINK
WATER
BUT
LET
MAN
AND
BEAST
BE
COVERED
WITH
SACKCLOTH
AND
CRY
MIGHTILY
UNTO
GOD
YEA
LET
THEM
TURN
EVERY
ONE
FROM
HIS
EVIL
WAY
AND
FROM
THE
VIOLENCE
THAT
IS
IN
THEIR
HANDS
WHO
CAN
TELL
IF
GOD
WILL
TURN
AND
REPENT
AND
TURN
AWAY
FROM
HIS
FIERCE
ANGER
THAT
WE
PERISH
NOT
AND
GOD
SAW
THEIR
WORKS
THAT
THEY
TURNED
FROM
THEIR
EVIL
WAY
AND
GOD
REPENTED
OF
THE
EVIL
THAT
HE
HAD
SAID
THAT
HE
WOULD
DO
UNTO
THEM
AND
HE
DID
IT
NOT
BUT
IT
DISPLEASED
JONAH
EXCEEDINGLY
AND
HE
WAS
VERY
ANGRY
AND
HE
PRAYED
UNTO
THE
LORD
AND
SAID
I
PRAY
THEE
O
LORD
WAS
NOT
THIS
MY
SAYING
WHEN
I
WAS
YET
IN
MY
COUNTRY
THEREFORE
I
FLED
BEFORE
UNTO
TARSHISH
FOR
I
KNEW
THAT
THOU
ART
A
GRACIOUS
GOD
AND
MERCIFUL
SLOW
TO
ANGER
AND
OF
GREAT
KINDNESS
AND
REPENTEST
THEE
OF
THE
EVIL
THEREFORE
NOW
O
LORD
TAKE
I
BESEECH
THEE
MY
LIFE
FROM
ME
FOR
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
ME
TO
DIE
THAN
TO
LIVE
THEN
SAID
THE
LORD
DOEST
THOU
WELL
TO
BE
ANGRY
SO
JONAH
WENT
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AND
SAT
ON
THE
EAST
SIDE
OF
THE
CITY
AND
THERE
MADE
HIM
A
BOOTH
AND
SAT
UNDER
IT
IN
THE
SHADOW
TILL
HE
MIGHT
SEE
WHAT
WOULD
BECOME
OF
THE
CITY
AND
THE
LORD
GOD
PREPARED
A
GOURD
AND
MADE
IT
TO
COME
UP
OVER
JONAH
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
SHADOW
OVER
HIS
HEAD
TO
DELIVER
HIM
FROM
HIS
GRIEF
SO
JONAH
WAS
EXCEEDING
GLAD
OF
THE
GOURD
BUT
GOD
PREPARED
A
WORM
WHEN
THE
MORNING
ROSE
THE
NEXT
DAY
AND
IT
SMOTE
THE
GOURD
THAT
IT
WITHERED
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
SUN
DID
ARISE
THAT
GOD
PREPARED
A
VEHEMENT
EAST
WIND
AND
THE
SUN
BEAT
UPON
THE
HEAD
OF
JONAH
THAT
HE
FAINTED
AND
WISHED
IN
HIMSELF
TO
DIE
AND
SAID
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
ME
TO
DIE
THAN
TO
LIVE
AND
GOD
SAID
TO
JONAH
DOEST
THOU
WELL
TO
BE
ANGRY
FOR
THE
GOURD
AND
HE
SAID
I
DO
WELL
TO
BE
ANGRY
EVEN
UNTO
DEATH
THEN
SAID
THE
LORD
THOU
HAST
HAD
PITY
ON
THE
GOURD
FOR
THE
WHICH
THOU
HAST
NOT
LABOURED
NEITHER
MADEST
IT
GROW
WHICH
CAME
UP
IN
A
NIGHT
AND
PERISHED
IN
A
NIGHT
AND
SHOULD
NOT
I
SPARE
NINEVEH
THAT
GREAT
CITY
WHEREIN
ARE
MORE
THEN
SIXSCORE
THOUSAND
PERSONS
THAT
CANNOT
DISCERN
BETWEEN
THEIR
RIGHT
HAND
AND
THEIR
LEFT
HAND
AND
ALSO
MUCH

THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
CAME
TO
MICAH
THE
MORASTHITE
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
JOTHAM
AHAZ
AND
HEZEKIAH
KINGS
OF
JUDAH
WHICH
HE
SAW
CONCERNING
SAMARIA
AND
JERUSALEM
HEAR
ALL
YE
PEOPLE
HEARKEN
O

AND
ALL
THAT
THEREIN
IS
AND
LET
THE
LORD
GOD
BE

THE
LORD
FROM
HIS
HOLY
TEMPLE
FOR
BEHOLD
THE
LORD
COMETH
FORTH
OUT
OF
HIS
PLACE
AND
WILL
COME
DOWN
AND
TREAD
UPON
THE
HIGH
PLACES
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
MOUNTAINS
SHALL
BE
MOLTEN
UNDER
HIM
AND
THE
VALLEYS
SHALL
BE
CLEFT
AS
WAX
BEFORE
THE
FIRE
AND
AS
THE
WATERS
THAT
ARE
POURED
DOWN
A
STEEP
PLACE
FOR
THE
TRANSGRESSION
OF

IS
ALL
THIS
AND
FOR

OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
WHAT

THE
TRANSGRESSION
OF
JACOB
IS
IT
NOT
SAMARIA
AND
WHAT
ARE
THE
HIGH
PLACES
OF
JUDAH
ARE
THEY

THEREFORE
I
WILL
MAKE
SAMARIA
AS
AN
HEAP
OF
THE
FIELD
AND
AS
PLANTINGS
OF
A
VINEYARD
AND
I
WILL
POUR

STONES
THEREOF

BEATEN
TO
PIECES
AND
ALL
THE

THEREOF
SHALL
BE
BURNED
WITH

FIRE
AND
ALL
THE
IDOLS
THEREOF
WILL
I
LAY
DESOLATE
FOR
SHE
GATHERED
IT
OF
THE
HIRE
OF
AN
HARLOT
AND
THEY
SHALL
RETURN
TO
THE
HIRE
OF
AN
HARLOT
THEREFORE
I
WILL
WAIL
AND
HOWL
I
WILL
GO
STRIPPED
AND
NAKED
I
WILL
MAKE
A
WAILING
LIKE
THE
DRAGONS
AND
MOURNING
AS
THE

INCURABLE
FOR

STRAIT
GATE
FOR
WIDE
IS
THE
GATE
AND
BROAD
IS
THE
WAY
THAT

THEREAT
BECAUSE
STRAIT
IS
THE

YE
SHALL
KNOW
THEM
BY
THEIR

DO
MEN
GATHER
GRAPES
OF
THORNS
OR
FIGS
OF

EVEN
SO
EVERY
GOOD
TREE
BRINGETH
FORTH
GOOD
FRUIT
BUT
A
CORRUPT
TREE
BRINGETH
FORTH
EVIL
FRUIT
A
GOOD
TREE
CANNOT
BRING
FORTH
EVIL
FRUIT
NEITHER
CAN
A
CORRUPT
TREE
BRING
FORTH
GOOD
FRUIT
EVERY
TREE
THAT
BRINGETH
NOT
FORTH
GOOD
FRUIT
IS
HEWN
DOWN
AND

WHEREFORE
BY
THEIR

YE
SHALL
KNOW
THEM
NOT
EVERY

THAT
SAITH
UNTO

LORD
LORD

ENTER
INTO
THE

THE

LORD
LORD

MANY
WONDERFUL
WORKS
AND
THEN

I
NEVER

INIQUITY
THEREFORE
WHOSOEVER

MAN
WHICH

BLEW
AND

IT
WAS
FOUNDED
UPON
A
ROCK
AND
EVERY

THAT
HEARETH
THESE

BLEW
AND
BEAT
UPON
THAT

AND
IT
FELL
AND
GREAT
WAS
THE
FALL
OF
IT
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
JESUS
HAD
ENDED
THESE
SAYINGS
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
ASTONISHED
AT
HIS
DOCTRINE
FOR
HE
TAUGHT
THEM
AS
ONE
HAVING

AND
NOT

THE
SCRIBES
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
DOWN
FROM
THE
MOUNTAIN
GREAT
MULTITUDES
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
CAME
A
LEPER
AND
WORSHIPPED
HIM
SAYING
LORD
IF
THOU
WILT
THOU
CANST
MAKE
ME
CLEAN
AND
JESUS
PUT
FORTH
HIS
HAND
AND
TOUCHED
HIM
SAYING
I
WILL
BE
THOU
CLEAN
AND
IMMEDIATELY
HIS
LEPROSY
WAS
CLEANSED
AND
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
SEE
THOU
TELL
NO
MAN
BUT
GO
THY
WAY
SHEW
THYSELF
TO
THE
PRIEST
AND
OFFER
THE
GIFT
THAT
MOSES
COMMANDED
FOR
A
TESTIMONY
UNTO
THEM
AND
WHEN
JESUS
WAS
ENTERED
INTO
CAPERNAUM
THERE
CAME
UNTO
HIM
A
CENTURION
BESEECHING
HIM
AND
SAYING
LORD
MY
SERVANT
LIETH
AT

SICK
OF
THE

GRIEVOUSLY
TORMENTED
AND
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
I
WILL
COME
AND
HEAL
HIM
THE
CENTURION
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
LORD
I
AM
NOT
WORTHY
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
COME
UNDER
MY
ROOF
BUT
SPEAK
THE
WORD
ONLY
AND
MY
SERVANT
SHALL
BE
HEALED
FOR
I
AM
A
MAN
UNDER
AUTHORITY
HAVING
SOLDIERS
UNDER
ME
AND
I
SAY
TO
THIS
MAN
GO
AND
HE
GOETH
AND
TO
ANOTHER
COME
AND
HE
COMETH
AND
TO
MY
SERVANT
DO
THIS
AND
HE
DOETH
IT
WHEN
JESUS
HEARD
IT

MARVELLED
AND
SAID
TO
THEM
THAT
FOLLOWED
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
I
HAVE
NOT
FOUND
SO
GREAT
FAITH
NO
NOT
IN

SIT
DOWN
WITH
ABRAHAM
AND
ISAAC
AND

BUT
THE

OF
THE
KINGDOM
SHALL
BE
CAST
OUT
INTO
OUTER
DARKNESS
THERE
SHALL
BE
WEEPING
AND
GNASHING
OF
TEETH
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THE
CENTURION
GO
THY
WAY
AND
AS
THOU
HAST
BELIEVED
SO
BE
IT
DONE
UNTO
THEE
AND
HIS

WAS
HEALED
IN
THE
SELFSAME
HOUR
AND
WHEN

WHEN

AND
HEALED
ALL

THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
FULFILLED
WHICH
WAS
SPOKEN
BY

FROM
THAT
HOUR
AND
WHEN
JESUS
CAME
INTO
THE
RULER'S
HOUSE
AND
SAW
THE
MINSTRELS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
MAKING
A
NOISE
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GIVE
PLACE
FOR
THE
MAID
IS
NOT
DEAD
BUT
SLEEPETH
AND
THEY
LAUGHED
HIM
TO
SCORN
BUT
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
PUT
FORTH
HE
WENT
IN
AND
TOOK
HER
BY
THE
HAND
AND
THE
MAID
AROSE
AND
THE
FAME
HEREOF
WENT
ABROAD
INTO
ALL
THAT
LAND
AND
WHEN
JESUS
DEPARTED
THENCE
TWO
BLIND
MEN
FOLLOWED
HIM
CRYING
AND
SAYING
THOU
SON
OF
DAVID
HAVE
MERCY
ON
US
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
INTO
THE
HOUSE
THE
BLIND
MEN
CAME
TO
HIM
AND
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
BELIEVE
YE
THAT
I
AM
ABLE
TO
DO
THIS
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
YEA
LORD
THEN
TOUCHED
HE
THEIR
EYES
SAYING
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
FAITH
BE
IT
UNTO
YOU
AND
THEIR
EYES
WERE
OPENED
AND
JESUS
STRAITLY
CHARGED
THEM
SAYING
SEE
THAT
NO
MAN
KNOW
IT
BUT
THEY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DEPARTED
SPREAD
ABROAD
HIS
FAME
IN
ALL
THAT
COUNTRY
AS
THEY
WENT
OUT
BEHOLD
THEY
BROUGHT
TO
HIM
A
DUMB
MAN
POSSESSED
WITH
A
DEVIL
AND
WHEN
THE
DEVIL
WAS
CAST
OUT
THE
DUMB
SPAKE
AND
THE
MULTITUDES
MARVELLED
SAYING
IT
WAS
NEVER
SO
SEEN
IN
ISRAEL
BUT
THE
PHARISEES
SAID
HE
CASTETH
OUT
DEVILS
THROUGH
THE
PRINCE
OF
THE
DEVILS
AND
JESUS
WENT
ABOUT
ALL
THE
CITIES
AND
VILLAGES
TEACHING
IN
THEIR
SYNAGOGUES
AND
PREACHING
THE
GOSPEL
OF
THE
KINGDOM
AND
HEALING
EVERY
SICKNESS
AND
EVERY
DISEASE
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
BUT
WHEN
HE
SAW
THE
MULTITUDES
HE
WAS
MOVED
WITH
COMPASSION
ON
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
FAINTED
AND
WERE
SCATTERED
ABROAD
AS
SHEEP
HAVING
NO
SHEPHERD
THEN
SAITH
HE
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
THE
HARVEST
TRULY
IS
PLENTEOUS
BUT
THE
LABOURERS
ARE
FEW
PRAY
YE
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
OF
THE
HARVEST
THAT
HE
WILL
SEND
FORTH
LABOURERS
INTO
HIS
HARVEST
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
CALLED
UNTO
HIM
HIS
TWELVE
DISCIPLES
HE
GAVE
THEM
POWER
AGAINST
UNCLEAN
SPIRITS
TO
CAST
THEM
OUT
AND
TO
HEAL
ALL
MANNER
OF
SICKNESS
AND
ALL
MANNER
OF
DISEASE
NOW

AND
WHEN

YOU
IT
SHALL
BE
MORE
TOLERABLE
FOR
THE
LAND
OF

BEHOLD
I
SEND
YOU
FORTH
AS

IN
THE
MIDST
OF
WOLVES
BE
YE
THEREFORE
WISE
AS
SERPENTS
AND
HARMLESS
AS
DOVES
BUT
BEWARE
OF
MEN
FOR
THEY
WILL
DELIVER
YOU
UP
TO
THE
COUNCILS
AND
THEY
WILL
SCOURGE
YOU
IN
THEIR
SYNAGOGUES
AND
YE
SHALL
BE
BROUGHT
BEFORE
GOVERNORS
AND
KINGS
FOR
MY
SAKE
FOR
A
TESTIMONY
AGAINST
THEM
AND
THE
GENTILES
BUT
WHEN

TAKE
NO

HOW
OR
WHAT
YE

SPEAK
FOR
IT
SHALL
BE
GIVEN

WHAT

AND
YE
SHALL
BE
HATED
OF
ALL
MEN
FOR
MY
NAME'S
SAKE
BUT
HE
THAT
ENDURETH
TO
THE
END
SHALL
BE
SAVED
BUT
WHEN

THE
DISCIPLE
IS
NOT
ABOVE

IT
IS
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
DISCIPLE
THAT
HE
BE
AS
HIS
MASTER
AND
THE
SERVANT
AS
HIS
LORD
IF
THEY
HAVE
CALLED
THE
MASTER
OF

BEELZEBUB
HOW

FEAR

AND
FEAR
NOT
THEM
WHICH

BUT
RATHER
FEAR
HIM
WHICH
IS
ABLE
TO
DESTROY
BOTH
SOUL

IN

ARE
NOT
TWO
SPARROWS
SOLD
FOR
A
FARTHING
AND
ONE
OF
THEM
SHALL
NOT
FALL
ON
THE

WITHOUT

BUT
THE

ARE
ALL
NUMBERED
FEAR

WHOSOEVER
THEREFORE
SHALL
CONFESS
ME
BEFORE

HIM
WILL
I
CONFESS
ALSO
BEFORE
MY

THINK
NOT
THAT
I
AM
COME

PEACE
ON

I
CAME
NOT

BUT
A
SWORD
FOR
I
AM
COME
TO
SET
A
MAN
AT
VARIANCE
AGAINST
HIS
FATHER
AND
THE
DAUGHTER
AGAINST
HER
MOTHER
AND
THE
DAUGHTER
IN

AGAINST

AND
A

HE
THAT
LOVETH

IS
NOT

AND
HE
THAT
LOVETH

MORE

IS
NOT
WORTHY
OF

AND
HE
THAT
TAKETH
NOT
HIS
CROSS
AND
FOLLOWETH
AFTER
ME
IS
NOT
WORTHY
OF
ME
HE
THAT
FINDETH
HIS

SHALL
LOSE
IT
AND
HE
THAT
LOSETH
HIS

FOR
MY
SAKE
SHALL
FIND
IT
HE
THAT
RECEIVETH
YOU
RECEIVETH

RECEIVETH
HIM
THAT

HE
THAT
RECEIVETH
A

REWARD
AND
HE
THAT
RECEIVETH
A
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
IN
THE

SHALL
RECEIVE
A
RIGHTEOUS
MAN'S

UNTO
ONE
OF
THESE
LITTLE
ONES
A
CUP
OF
COLD
WATER
ONLY
IN
THE
NAME
OF
A
DISCIPLE
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
HE
SHALL
IN
NO
WISE
LOSE
HIS
REWARD
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
JESUS
HAD
MADE
AN
END
OF
COMMANDING
HIS
TWELVE
DISCIPLES
HE
DEPARTED
THENCE
TO
TEACH
AND
TO
PREACH
IN
THEIR
CITIES
NOW
WHEN
JOHN
HAD
HEARD
IN
THE
PRISON
THE
WORKS
OF
CHRIST
HE
SENT
TWO
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ART
THOU
HE
THAT
SHOULD
COME
OR
DO
WE
LOOK
FOR
ANOTHER
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GO
AND
SHEW
JOHN
AGAIN
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
YE
DO
HEAR
AND
SEE
THE
BLIND
RECEIVE
THEIR
SIGHT
AND
THE
LAME
WALK
THE
LEPERS
ARE
CLEANSED
AND
THE
DEAF
HEAR
THE
DEAD
ARE
RAISED
UP
AND
THE
POOR
HAVE
THE
GOSPEL
PREACHED
TO
THEM
AND
BLESSED
IS
HE
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
NOT
BE
OFFENDED
IN
ME
AND
AS
THEY
DEPARTED
JESUS
BEGAN
TO
SAY
UNTO
THE
MULTITUDES
CONCERNING
JOHN
WHAT
WENT
YE
OUT
INTO
THE
WILDERNESS
TO
SEE
A
REED
SHAKEN
WITH
THE
WIND
BUT
WHAT
WENT
YE
OUT
FOR
TO
SEE
A
MAN
CLOTHED
IN
SOFT
RAIMENT
BEHOLD
THEY
THAT
WEAR
SOFT
CLOTHING
ARE
IN

HOUSES
BUT
WHAT
WENT
YE
OUT
FOR
TO
SEE
A
PROPHET
YEA
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
AND
MORE
THAN
A
PROPHET
FOR
THIS
IS
HE
OF
WHOM
IT
IS
WRITTEN
BEHOLD
I
SEND
MY
MESSENGER
BEFORE
THY
FACE
WHICH

RISEN
A
GREATER
THAN
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
NOTWITHSTANDING
HE
THAT
IS
LEAST
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
GREATER
THAN
HE
AND
FROM
THE
DAYS
OF
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
UNTIL
NOW
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
SUFFERETH
VIOLENCE
AND
THE
VIOLENT
TAKE
IT
BY
FORCE
FOR
ALL
THE
PROPHETS
AND
THE
LAW
PROPHESIED
UNTIL
JOHN
AND
IF
YE
WILL
RECEIVE
IT
THIS
IS
ELIAS
WHICH
WAS
FOR
TO
COME
HE
THAT
HATH
EARS
TO
HEAR
LET
HIM
HEAR
BUT
WHEREUNTO
SHALL
I
LIKEN
THIS
GENERATION
IT
IS
LIKE
UNTO
CHILDREN
SITTING
IN
THE
MARKETS
AND
CALLING
UNTO
THEIR
FELLOWS
AND
SAYING
WE
HAVE
PIPED
UNTO
YOU
AND
YE
HAVE
NOT
DANCED
WE
HAVE
MOURNED
UNTO
YOU
AND
YE
HAVE
NOT
LAMENTED
FOR
JOHN
CAME
NEITHER
EATING
NOR
DRINKING
AND
THEY
SAY
HE
HATH
A
DEVIL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
CAME
EATING
AND
DRINKING
AND
THEY
SAY
BEHOLD
A
MAN
GLUTTONOUS
AND
A
WINEBIBBER
A
FRIEND
OF
PUBLICANS
AND
SINNERS
BUT
WISDOM
IS
JUSTIFIED
OF
HER
CHILDREN
THEN
BEGAN
HE
TO
UPBRAID
THE
CITIES
WHEREIN
MOST
OF
HIS
MIGHTY
WORKS
WERE
DONE
BECAUSE
THEY
REPENTED
NOT
WOE
UNTO
THEE
CHORAZIN
WOE
UNTO
THEE
BETHSAIDA
FOR
IF
THE
MIGHTY
WORKS
WHICH

DONE
IN
YOU
HAD
BEEN
DONE
IN
TYRE
AND
SIDON
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
REPENTED
LONG
AGO
IN
SACKCLOTH
AND
ASHES
BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
IT
SHALL
BE
MORE
TOLERABLE
FOR
TYRE
AND
SIDON
AT
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGMENT
THAN
FOR
YOU
AND
THOU
CAPERNAUM
WHICH
ART
EXALTED
UNTO
HEAVEN
SHALT
BE
BROUGHT
DOWN
TO
HELL
FOR
IF

WORKS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
IN
THEE
HAD
BEEN
DONE
IN
SODOM
IT
WOULD
HAVE
REMAINED
UNTIL
THIS
DAY
BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
IT
SHALL
BE
MORE
TOLERABLE
FOR
THE
LAND
OF
SODOM
IN
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGMENT
THAN
FOR
THEE
AT
THAT
TIME
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
I
THANK
THEE
O
FATHER
LORD
OF
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
BECAUSE
THOU
HAST
HID
THESE
THINGS
FROM
THE
WISE
AND
PRUDENT
AND
HAST
REVEALED
THEM
UNTO
BABES
EVEN
SO
FATHER
FOR
SO
IT
SEEMED
GOOD
IN
THY
SIGHT
ALL
THINGS
ARE
DELIVERED
UNTO
ME
OF
MY
FATHER
AND
NO
MAN
KNOWETH
THE
SON
BUT
THE
FATHER
NEITHER
KNOWETH
ANY
MAN
THE
FATHER
SAVE
THE
SON
AND
HE
TO
WHOMSOEVER
THE
SON
WILL
REVEAL
HIM
COME
UNTO
ME
ALL
YE
THAT
LABOUR
AND
ARE
HEAVY
LADEN
AND
I
WILL
GIVE
YOU
REST
TAKE
MY
YOKE
UPON
YOU
AND
LEARN
OF
ME
FOR
I
AM
MEEK
AND
LOWLY
IN
HEART
AND
YE
SHALL
FIND
REST
UNTO
YOUR
SOULS
FOR
MY
YOKE
IS
EASY
AND
MY
BURDEN
IS
LIGHT
AT
THAT
TIME
JESUS
WENT
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
THROUGH
THE
CORN
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
WERE
AN
HUNGRED
AND
BEGAN
TO
PLUCK
THE
EARS
OF
CORN
AND
TO
EAT
BUT
WHEN
THE
PHARISEES
SAW
IT
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
BEHOLD
THY
DISCIPLES
DO
THAT
WHICH
IS
NOT
LAWFUL
TO
DO
UPON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
BUT
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
HAVE
YE
NOT
READ
WHAT
DAVID
DID
WHEN
HE
WAS
AN
HUNGRED
AND
THEY
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
HOW
HE
ENTERED
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
AND
DID
EAT
THE
SHEWBREAD
WHICH
WAS
NOT
LAWFUL
FOR
HIM
TO
EAT
NEITHER
FOR
THEM
WHICH
WERE
WITH
HIM
BUT
ONLY
FOR
THE
PRIESTS
OR
HAVE
YE
NOT
READ
IN
THE
LAW
HOW
THAT
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAYS
THE
PRIESTS
IN
THE
TEMPLE
PROFANE
THE
SABBATH
AND
ARE
BLAMELESS
BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
IN
THIS
PLACE
IS
ONE
GREATER
THAN
THE
TEMPLE
BUT
IF
YE
HAD
KNOWN
WHAT
THIS
MEANETH
I
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
AND
NOT
SACRIFICE
YE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
CONDEMNED
THE
GUILTLESS
FOR
THE
SON
OF
MAN
IS
LORD
EVEN
OF
THE
SABBATH
DAY
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
DEPARTED
THENCE
HE
WENT
INTO
THEIR
SYNAGOGUE
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
WHICH
HAD
HIS
HAND
WITHERED
AND
THEY
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
IS
IT
LAWFUL
TO
HEAL
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAYS
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
ACCUSE
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHAT
MAN
SHALL
THERE
BE
AMONG
YOU
THAT
SHALL
HAVE
ONE
SHEEP
AND
IF
IT
FALL
INTO
A
PIT
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
WILL
HE
NOT
LAY
HOLD
ON
IT
AND
LIFT
IT
OUT
HOW
MUCH
THEN
IS
A
MAN
BETTER
THAN
A
SHEEP
WHEREFORE
IT
IS
LAWFUL
TO
DO
WELL
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAYS
THEN
SAITH
HE
TO
THE
MAN
STRETCH
FORTH
THINE
HAND
AND
HE
STRETCHED
IT
FORTH
AND
IT
WAS
RESTORED
WHOLE
LIKE
AS
THE
OTHER
THEN
THE
PHARISEES
WENT
OUT
AND
HELD
A
COUNCIL
AGAINST
HIM
HOW
THEY
MIGHT
DESTROY
HIM
BUT
WHEN
JESUS
KNEW
IT
HE
WITHDREW
HIMSELF
FROM
THENCE
AND
GREAT
MULTITUDES
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
HE
HEALED
THEM
ALL
AND
CHARGED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
MAKE
HIM
KNOWN
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
FULFILLED
WHICH
WAS
SPOKEN
BY
ESAIAS
THE
PROPHET
SAYING
BEHOLD
MY
SERVANT
WHOM
I
HAVE
CHOSEN
MY
BELOVED
IN
WHOM
MY
SOUL
IS
WELL
PLEASED
I
WILL
PUT
MY
SPIRIT
UPON
HIM
AND
HE
SHALL
SHEW
JUDGMENT
TO
THE
GENTILES
HE
SHALL
NOT
STRIVE
NOR
CRY
NEITHER
SHALL
ANY
MAN
HEAR
HIS
VOICE
IN
THE
STREETS
A
BRUISED
REED
SHALL
HE
NOT
BREAK
AND
SMOKING
FLAX
SHALL
HE
NOT
QUENCH
TILL
HE
SEND
FORTH
JUDGMENT
UNTO
VICTORY
AND
IN
HIS
NAME
SHALL
THE
GENTILES
TRUST
THEN
WAS
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
ONE
POSSESSED
WITH
A
DEVIL
BLIND
AND
DUMB
AND
HE
HEALED
HIM
INSOMUCH
THAT
THE
BLIND
AND
DUMB
BOTH
SPAKE
AND
SAW
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
AMAZED
AND
SAID
IS
NOT
THIS
THE
SON
OF
DAVID
BUT
WHEN
THE
PHARISEES
HEARD
IT
THEY
SAID
THIS
FELLOW
DOTH
NOT
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
BUT
BY
BEELZEBUB
THE
PRINCE
OF
THE
DEVILS
AND
JESUS
KNEW
THEIR
THOUGHTS
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
EVERY
KINGDOM
DIVIDED
AGAINST
ITSELF
IS
BROUGHT
TO
DESOLATION
AND
EVERY
CITY
OR
HOUSE
DIVIDED
AGAINST
ITSELF
SHALL
NOT
STAND
AND
IF
SATAN
CAST
OUT
SATAN
HE
IS
DIVIDED
AGAINST
HIMSELF
HOW
SHALL
THEN
HIS
KINGDOM
STAND
AND
IF
I
BY
BEELZEBUB
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
BY
WHOM
DO
YOUR
CHILDREN
CAST
THEM
OUT
THEREFORE
THEY
SHALL
BE
YOUR
JUDGES
BUT
IF
I
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
BY
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
THEN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD

HOW

AN

ADULTEROUS
GENERATION
SEEKETH
AFTER
A

AND
THERE
SHALL
NO

THE
SIGN
OF
THE

JONAS
FOR
AS
JONAS
WAS
THREE

BELLY
SO

OF
THE

THE
MEN
OF
NINEVEH
SHALL
RISE
IN

CONDEMN
IT
BECAUSE
THEY

AT
THE

AND
BEHOLD
A

JONAS
IS
HERE
THE
QUEEN
OF
THE

SHALL
RISE
UP
IN

TO

OF
SOLOMON
AND
BEHOLD
A
GREATER

WHEN
THE
UNCLEAN
SPIRIT
IS
GONE
OUT
OF
A
MAN
HE
WALKETH
THROUGH
DRY
PLACES
SEEKING
REST
AND
FINDETH
NONE
THEN
HE
SAITH
I
WILL
RETURN
INTO
MY
HOUSE
FROM
WHENCE
I
CAME
OUT
AND
WHEN
HE
IS
COME
HE
FINDETH

GARNISHED
THEN
GOETH
HE
AND
TAKETH
WITH

SEVEN
OTHER
SPIRITS
MORE
WICKED

AND
THEY
ENTER
IN
AND
DWELL
THERE
AND
THE
LAST
STATE
OF
THAT

IS
WORSE
THAN
THE
FIRST
EVEN
SO
SHALL
IT
BE
ALSO
UNTO
THIS
WICKED
GENERATION
WHILE

YET
TALKED
TO
THE
PEOPLE
BEHOLD
HIS

STOOD
WITHOUT

AND
HE
STRETCHED
FORTH
HIS

TOWARD
HIS

AND
SAID
BEHOLD
MY

AND
MY

FOR
WHOSOEVER

DO
THE
WILL
OF
MY
FATHER
WHICH
IS
IN

THE

THE

GREAT
MULTITUDES
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
UNTO

SO
THAT
HE
WENT

STOOD
ON

AND
HE
SPAKE
MANY
THINGS
UNTO

IN
PARABLES
SAYING
BEHOLD
A
SOWER
WENT
FORTH
TO

AND
WHEN

SOWED
SOME

DEVOURED
THEM
UP
SOME
FELL
UPON
STONY
PLACES
WHERE
THEY
HAD
NOT
MUCH
EARTH
AND
FORTHWITH
THEY
SPRUNG
UP
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
NO

AND
WHEN
THE

THEY
WERE
SCORCHED
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
NO

THEY
WITHERED
AWAY
AND
SOME
FELL
AMONG

SOME
SIXTYFOLD
SOME
THIRTYFOLD
WHO
HATH
EARS
TO

LET
HIM
HEAR
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
CAME
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHY
SPEAKEST
THOU
UNTO
THEM
IN
PARABLES
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
BECAUSE
IT
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
YOU
TO
KNOW
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE

OF
HEAVEN
BUT
TO
THEM
IT
IS
NOT

FOR
WHOSOEVER
HATH
TO

WHOSOEVER
HATH
NOT

TAKEN
AWAY
EVEN
THAT

THE

NEVERTHELESS
FOR

HE
DEPARTED
THENCE
BY

PLACE
APART
AND
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
HEARD
THEREOF
THEY
FOLLOWED
HIM
ON

OUT
OF
THE

AND
JESUS
WENT
FORTH
AND
SAW
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
AND
WAS
MOVED
WITH
COMPASSION
TOWARD
THEM
AND
HE
HEALED
THEIR
SICK
AND
WHEN

HIS
DISCIPLES
CAME
TO
HIM
SAYING

AWAY
THAT
THEY

GO
INTO
THE
VILLAGES
AND
BUY
THEMSELVES
VICTUALS
BUT
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THEY
NEED
NOT
DEPART
GIVE
YE
THEM
TO
EAT
AND
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
WE
HAVE
HERE
BUT
FIVE
LOAVES
AND
TWO
FISHES
HE
SAID
BRING
THEM
HITHER

AND
HE
COMMANDED
THE
MULTITUDE
TO
SIT
DOWN
ON
THE
GRASS
AND
TOOK
THE
FIVE
LOAVES
AND
THE
TWO
FISHES
AND
LOOKING
UP
TO
HEAVEN
HE
BLESSED
AND
BRAKE
AND
GAVE
THE
LOAVES
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
THEY
DID
ALL
EAT
AND
WERE
FILLED
AND
THEY
TOOK
UP
OF
THE
FRAGMENTS
THAT
REMAINED
TWELVE
BASKETS
FULL
AND
THEY
THAT
HAD
EATEN
WERE
ABOUT
FIVE
THOUSAND
MEN
BESIDE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
AND
STRAIGHTWAY
JESUS
CONSTRAINED
HIS
DISCIPLES
TO
GET
INTO
A
SHIP
AND
TO
GO
BEFORE
HIM
UNTO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
WHILE
HE
SENT
THE
MULTITUDES
AWAY
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
SENT
THE
MULTITUDES
AWAY
HE
WENT
UP
INTO
A
MOUNTAIN
APART
TO
PRAY
AND
WHEN
THE
EVENING
WAS
COME
HE
WAS
THERE
ALONE
BUT

UNTO
THEM
WALKING
ON
THE

AND
WHEN
THE
DISCIPLES
SAW
HIM
WALKING
ON
THE
SEA
THEY
WERE
TROUBLED
SAYING

A
SPIRIT
AND
THEY
CRIED
OUT
FOR
FEAR
BUT
STRAIGHTWAY
JESUS
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
SAYING

HE
WALKED
ON

TO
GO
TO
JESUS
BUT
WHEN
HE
SAW
THE
WIND
BOISTEROUS
HE
WAS
AFRAID
AND
BEGINNING
TO

HE
CRIED
SAYING
LORD

IMMEDIATELY
JESUS
STRETCHED
FORTH
HIS

AND
CAUGHT
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO

WHEREFORE

CAME
AND
WORSHIPPED
HIM
SAYING
OF
A

THOU
ART
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GONE
OVER
THEY
CAME
INTO
THE
LAND
OF
GENNESARET
AND
WHEN
THE
MEN
OF
THAT
PLACE
HAD
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HIM
THEY
SENT
OUT
INTO
ALL
THAT
COUNTRY
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
ALL
THAT
WERE
DISEASED
AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
ONLY
TOUCH
THE
HEM
OF
HIS
GARMENT
AND
AS
MANY
AS
TOUCHED
WERE
MADE
PERFECTLY
WHOLE
THEN
CAME
TO
JESUS
SCRIBES
AND
PHARISEES
WHICH
WERE
OF
JERUSALEM
SAYING
WHY
DO
THY
DISCIPLES
TRANSGRESS
THE
TRADITION
OF
THE
ELDERS
FOR
THEY
WASH
NOT
THEIR

AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY

YE
ALSO
TRANSGRESS
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF

FOR

IT
IS
A
GIFT
BY
WHATSOEVER
THOU
MIGHTEST
BE
PROFITED
BY
ME
AND
HONOUR
NOT
HIS

HE
SHALL
BE
FREE
THUS
HAVE
YE
MADE
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
GOD
OF

YE
HYPOCRITES

BUT
THEIR
HEART
IS
FAR
FROM
ME
BUT
IN
VAIN
THEY
DO
WORSHIP
ME
TEACHING
FOR
DOCTRINES
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
MEN
AND
HE
CALLED
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
HEAR
AND
UNDERSTAND
NOT
THAT
WHICH
GOETH
INTO
THE
MOUTH
DEFILETH
A

AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
KNOWEST
THOU
THAT
THE
PHARISEES
WERE

BUT
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
EVERY

HEAVENLY
FATHER
HATH
NOT

SHALL
BE
ROOTED

LET
THEM

THEY
BE
BLIND
LEADERS
OF

THEN
ANSWERED
PETER
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
DECLARE
UNTO

THIS
PARABLE
AND
JESUS
SAID
ARE

ALSO
YET
WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING
DO
NOT

THAT
WHATSOEVER
ENTERETH
IN
AT
THE
MOUTH
GOETH
INTO
THE
BELLY
AND
IS
CAST
OUT
INTO
THE

BUT
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
PROCEED
OUT
OF
THE
MOUTH
COME
FORTH
FROM
THE

MURDERS
ADULTERIES
FORNICATIONS
THEFTS
FALSE

THESE
ARE
THE
THINGS
WHICH
DEFILE
A

BUT
TO

THEN
JESUS
WENT

AND
DEPARTED
INTO
THE

AND
SIDON
AND
BEHOLD
A

O

THOU
SON
OF

MY
DAUGHTER
IS
GRIEVOUSLY
VEXED
WITH

BUT
HE
ANSWERED
HER
NOT
A

AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
CAME
AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
SAYING
SEND
HER
AWAY
FOR
SHE
CRIETH
AFTER
US
BUT
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
I
AM

BUT
UNTO
THE
LOST
SHEEP
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
THEN
CAME
SHE
AND
WORSHIPPED
HIM
SAYING
LORD

BUT
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
IT
IS
NOT

AND
SHE
SAID
TRUTH
LORD
YET
THE
DOGS
EAT
OF
THE
CRUMBS
WHICH
FALL
FROM
THEIR

TABLE
THEN
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HER
O

AND
JESUS
DEPARTED
FROM
THENCE
AND
CAME
NIGH
UNTO
THE
SEA
OF
GALILEE
AND
WENT
UP
INTO
A
MOUNTAIN
AND
SAT
DOWN
THERE
AND
GREAT
MULTITUDES
CAME
UNTO
HIM
HAVING
WITH
THEM
THOSE
THAT
WERE
LAME
BLIND
DUMB
MAIMED
AND
MANY
OTHERS
AND
CAST
THEM
DOWN
AT
JESUS'
FEET
AND
HE
HEALED
THEM
INSOMUCH
THAT
THE
MULTITUDE
WONDERED
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
DUMB
TO
SPEAK
THE
MAIMED
TO
BE
WHOLE
THE
LAME
TO
WALK
AND
THE
BLIND
TO
SEE
AND
THEY
GLORIFIED
THE
GOD
OF
ISRAEL
THEN
JESUS
CALLED
HIS
DISCIPLES
UNTO
HIM
AND
SAID
I
HAVE
COMPASSION
ON
THE
MULTITUDE
BECAUSE
THEY
CONTINUE
WITH
ME
NOW
THREE
DAYS
AND
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
EAT
AND
I
WILL
NOT
SEND
THEM
AWAY
FASTING
LEST
THEY
FAINT
IN
THE
WAY
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
SAY
UNTO
HIM
WHENCE
SHOULD
WE
HAVE
SO
MUCH
BREAD
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AS
TO
FILL
SO
GREAT
A
MULTITUDE
AND
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
HOW
MANY
LOAVES
HAVE
YE
AND
THEY
SAID
SEVEN
AND
A
FEW
LITTLE
FISHES
AND
HE
COMMANDED
THE
MULTITUDE
TO
SIT
DOWN
ON
THE
GROUND
AND
HE
TOOK
THE
SEVEN
LOAVES
AND
THE
FISHES
AND
GAVE
THANKS
AND
BRAKE
THEM
AND
GAVE
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
THEY
DID
ALL
EAT
AND
WERE
FILLED
AND
THEY
TOOK
UP
OF
THE
BROKEN
MEAT
THAT
WAS
LEFT
SEVEN
BASKETS
FULL
AND
THEY
THAT
DID
EAT
WERE
FOUR
THOUSAND
MEN
BESIDE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
AND
HE
SENT
AWAY
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
TOOK
SHIP
AND
CAME
INTO
THE
COASTS
OF
MAGDALA
THE
PHARISEES
ALSO
WITH
THE
SADDUCEES
CAME
AND
TEMPTING
DESIRED
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
SHEW
THEM
A
SIGN
FROM
HEAVEN
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHEN
IT
IS
EVENING
YE
SAY
IT
WILL
BE
FAIR
WEATHER
FOR
THE
SKY
IS
RED
AND
IN
THE
MORNING
IT
WILL
BE
FOUL
WEATHER
TO

FOR
THE
SKY
IS
RED
AND
LOWERING
O
YE
HYPOCRITES
YE
CAN
DISCERN
THE
FACE
OF
THE
SKY
BUT
CAN
YE
NOT
DISCERN
THE
SIGNS
OF
THE
TIMES
A
WICKED
AND
ADULTEROUS
GENERATION
SEEKETH
AFTER
A
SIGN
AND
THERE
SHALL
NO
SIGN
BE
GIVEN
UNTO
IT
BUT
THE
SIGN
OF
THE
PROPHET
JONAS
AND
HE
LEFT
THEM
AND
DEPARTED
AND
WHEN
HIS
DISCIPLES
WERE
COME
TO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
THEY
HAD
FORGOTTEN
TO
TAKE
BREAD
THEN
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
TAKE
HEED
AND
BEWARE
OF
THE
LEAVEN
OF
THE
PHARISEES
AND
OF
THE
SADDUCEES
AND
THEY
REASONED
AMONG
THEMSELVES
SAYING
IT
IS
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
TAKEN
NO
BREAD
WHICH
WHEN
JESUS
PERCEIVED
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
O
YE
OF
LITTLE
FAITH
WHY
REASON
YE
AMONG
YOURSELVES
BECAUSE
YE
HAVE
BROUGHT
NO
BREAD
DO
YE
NOT

UNDERSTAND
NEITHER
REMEMBER
THE
FIVE
LOAVES
OF
THE
FIVE
THOUSAND
AND
HOW
MANY
BASKETS
YE
TOOK
UP
NEITHER
THE
SEVEN
LOAVES
OF
THE
FOUR
THOUSAND
AND
HOW
MANY
BASKETS
YE
TOOK
UP
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
YE
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THAT
I
SPAKE
IT
NOT
TO
YOU
CONCERNING
BREAD
THAT
YE
SHOULD
BEWARE
OF
THE
LEAVEN
OF
THE
PHARISEES
AND
OF
THE
SADDUCEES
THEN
UNDERSTOOD
THEY
HOW
THAT
HE
BADE
THEM
NOT
BEWARE
OF
THE
LEAVEN
OF
BREAD
BUT
OF
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
PHARISEES
AND
OF
THE
SADDUCEES
WHEN
JESUS
CAME
INTO
THE
COASTS
OF
CAESAREA
PHILIPPI
HE
ASKED
HIS
DISCIPLES
SAYING
WHOM
DO
MEN
SAY
THAT
I
THE
SON
OF

AND
THEY
SAID
SOME
SAY
THAT
THOU
ART
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
SOME
ELIAS
AND
OTHERS
JEREMIAS
OR
ONE
OF
THE
PROPHETS
HE

BUT
WHOM

AND
SIMON
PETER
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
THOU

ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO

BLESSED
ART
THOU
SIMON
BARJONA
FOR

AND
BLOOD
HATH
NOT
REVEALED

AND
I
SAY
ALSO
UNTO

PETER
AND
UPON
THIS
ROCK
I

SHALL
BE
BOUND
IN
HEAVEN
AND
WHATSOEVER
THOU
SHALT
LOOSE
ON
EARTH
SHALL
BE
LOOSED
IN
HEAVEN
THEN
CHARGED
HE
HIS
DISCIPLES
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
TELL
NO
MAN
THAT
HE
WAS
JESUS
THE
CHRIST
FROM
THAT
TIME
FORTH
BEGAN
JESUS
TO
SHEW
UNTO
HIS

HOW

AND
SUFFER
MANY
THINGS
OF
THE
ELDERS
AND
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
SCRIBES
AND
BE
KILLED
AND
BE
RAISED
AGAIN
THE
THIRD
DAY
THEN
PETER
TOOK
HIM
AND
BEGAN
TO
REBUKE
HIM
SAYING
BE
IT
FAR
FROM
THEE
LORD
THIS
SHALL
NOT
BE
UNTO
THEE
BUT
HE
TURNED
AND
SAID
UNTO
PETER
GET

BEHIND
ME
SATAN
THOU
ART
AN
OFFENCE
UNTO
ME
FOR
THOU
SAVOUREST
NOT
THE
THINGS
THAT
BE
OF
GOD
BUT
THOSE
THAT
BE
OF
MEN
THEN
SAID
JESUS
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
IF
ANY
MAN
WILL
COME
AFTER
ME
LET
HIM
DENY
HIMSELF
AND
TAKE
UP
HIS
CROSS
AND
FOLLOW
ME
FOR
WHOSOEVER
WILL
SAVE
HIS
LIFE
SHALL
LOSE
IT
AND
WHOSOEVER
WILL
LOSE
HIS
LIFE
FOR
MY
SAKE
SHALL
FIND
IT
FOR
WHAT
IS
A
MAN
PROFITED
IF
HE
SHALL
GAIN
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
AND
LOSE
HIS

SOUL
OR
WHAT

GIVE
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
HIS

FOR
THE
SON
OF

SHALL
COME
IN

GLORY
OF
HIS

AND
THEN
HE
SHALL
REWARD
EVERY

ACCORDING
TO
HIS
WORKS
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THERE
BE
SOME
STANDING
HERE
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
TASTE
OF
DEATH
TILL
THEY
SEE
THE
SON
OF
MAN
COMING

AND
AFTER
SIX
DAYS
JESUS
TAKETH
PETER
JAMES
AND
JOHN
HIS

AND
BRINGETH
THEM
UP
INTO
AN
HIGH
MOUNTAIN
APART
AND
WAS
TRANSFIGURED
BEFORE
THEM
AND
HIS
FACE
DID
SHINE
AS
THE
SUN
AND
HIS
RAIMENT
WAS
WHITE
AS
THE
LIGHT
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
APPEARED
UNTO
THEM
MOSES
AND
ELIAS
TALKING
WITH
HIM
THEN
ANSWERED
PETER
AND
SAID
UNTO
JESUS
LORD
IT

GOOD
FOR
US
TO
BE
HERE
IF
THOU
WILT
LET
US
MAKE
HERE
THREE
TABERNACLES
ONE

WHILE

BEHOLD
A

OUT
OF
THE
CLOUD
WHICH
SAID
THIS
IS
MY
BELOVED
SON
IN
WHOM
I
AM
WELL
PLEASED
HEAR

HIM
AND
WHEN
THE
DISCIPLES
HEARD
IT
THEY
FELL
ON
THEIR
FACE
AND
WERE
SORE
AFRAID
AND
JESUS
CAME
AND
TOUCHED
THEM
AND
SAID
ARISE
AND
BE
NOT
AFRAID
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
LIFTED
UP
THEIR
EYES
THEY
SAW
NO
MAN
SAVE
JESUS
ONLY
AND
AS
THEY
CAME
DOWN
FROM
THE
MOUNTAIN
JESUS
CHARGED
THEM
SAYING
TELL
THE
VISION
TO
NO
MAN
UNTIL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
RISEN
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
WHY
THEN
SAY
THE
SCRIBES
THAT

JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
ELIAS
TRULY
SHALL

RESTORE
ALL
THINGS
BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU

HAVE
DONE
UNTO
HIM
WHATSOEVER
THEY
LISTED
LIKEWISE
SHALL
ALSO
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SUFFER
OF
THEM
THEN
THE
DISCIPLES
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
HE
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
OF
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
TO
THE
MULTITUDE
THERE
CAME
TO
HIM
A
CERTAIN
MAN
KNEELING
DOWN
TO
HIM
AND
SAYING
LORD

FIRE
AND
OFT
INTO
THE
WATER
AND
I
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
THY
DISCIPLES
AND
THEY
COULD
NOT
CURE
HIM
THEN
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
O
FAITHLESS
AND
PERVERSE
GENERATION
HOW
LONG
SHALL
I
BE
WITH
YOU
HOW
LONG
SHALL
I
SUFFER
YOU
BRING

AND
JESUS
REBUKED
THE
DEVIL
AND
HE
DEPARTED
OUT
OF

AND
THE
CHILD
WAS
CURED
FROM
THAT
VERY
HOUR
THEN
CAME
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
JESUS
APART
AND
SAID
WHY
COULD
NOT
WE

AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
YOUR
UNBELIEF
FOR
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO

IMPOSSIBLE
UNTO
YOU
HOWBEIT
THIS
KIND
GOETH
NOT
OUT
BUT
BY
PRAYER
AND
FASTING
AND
WHILE

ABODE
IN
GALILEE
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
BE
BETRAYED
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
MEN
AND
THEY
SHALL
KILL
HIM
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
SHALL
BE
RAISED

AND
THEY
WERE
EXCEEDING
SORRY
AND
WHEN

TRIBUTE
MONEY
CAME
TO
PETER
AND
SAID
DOTH

JESUS
PREVENTED

SIMON
OF

THOU
SHALT
FIND
A

UNTO
JESUS
SAYING
WHO

BUT
WHOSO

IT

WERE
DROWNED
IN
THE
DEPTH
OF
THE

FOR

WHEREFORE
IF

IT
IS
BETTER
FOR

FIRE
AND
IF

EYE
OFFEND
THEE
PLUCK

IT
IS

EVEN
SO
IT
IS
NOT
THE
WILL
OF
YOUR
FATHER
WHICH

THAT

HIS
FAULT
BETWEEN

IF

THEE
THOU
HAST
GAINED
THY

BUT
IF

MORE
THAT
IN
THE
MOUTH
OF
TWO

WITNESSES
EVERY
WORD
MAY
BE

AS
AN
HEATHEN
MAN
AND
A
PUBLICAN
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
WHATSOEVER
YE
SHALL
BIND
ON
EARTH
SHALL
BE
BOUND
IN
HEAVEN
AND
WHATSOEVER
YE
SHALL
LOOSE
ON
EARTH
SHALL
BE
LOOSED
IN
HEAVEN
AGAIN
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
IF
TWO
OF
YOU
SHALL
AGREE
ON
EARTH
AS
TOUCHING
ANY
THING
THAT
THEY
SHALL
ASK
IT
SHALL
BE
DONE
FOR
THEM
OF
MY

WHICH
IS

HEAVEN
FOR
WHERE
TWO
OR
THREE
ARE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
IN
MY
NAME
THERE
AM
I
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
THEN
CAME
PETER
TO
HIM
AND
SAID
LORD
HOW
OFT
SHALL
MY
BROTHER
SIN
AGAINST
ME
AND
I
FORGIVE
HIM
TILL
SEVEN
TIMES
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
I
SAY
NOT
UNTO
THEE
UNTIL
SEVEN
TIMES
BUT
UNTIL
SEVENTY
TIMES
SEVEN
THEREFORE
IS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
LIKENED
UNTO
A
CERTAIN
KING
WHICH
WOULD
TAKE
ACCOUNT
OF
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
BEGUN
TO
RECKON
ONE
WAS
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
WHICH
OWED
HIM
TEN
THOUSAND
TALENTS
BUT
FORASMUCH
AS
HE
HAD
NOT
TO
PAY
HIS
LORD
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
BE
SOLD
AND
HIS
WIFE
AND
CHILDREN
AND
ALL
THAT
HE
HAD
AND
PAYMENT
TO
BE
MADE
THE
SERVANT
THEREFORE
FELL
DOWN
AND
WORSHIPPED
HIM
SAYING
LORD
HAVE
PATIENCE
WITH
ME
AND
I
WILL
PAY
THEE
ALL
THEN
THE
LORD
OF
THAT
SERVANT
WAS
MOVED
WITH
COMPASSION
AND
LOOSED
HIM
AND
FORGAVE
HIM
THE
DEBT
BUT
THE
SAME
SERVANT
WENT
OUT
AND
FOUND
ONE
OF
HIS
FELLOWSERVANTS
WHICH
OWED
HIM
AN
HUNDRED
PENCE
AND
HE
LAID
HANDS
ON
HIM
AND
TOOK
HIM
BY
THE
THROAT
SAYING
PAY
ME
THAT
THOU
OWEST
AND
HIS
FELLOWSERVANT
FELL
DOWN
AT
HIS
FEET
AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
SAYING
HAVE
PATIENCE
WITH
ME
AND
I
WILL
PAY
THEE
ALL
AND
HE
WOULD
NOT
BUT
WENT
AND
CAST
HIM
INTO
PRISON
TILL
HE
SHOULD
PAY
THE
DEBT
SO
WHEN
HIS
FELLOWSERVANTS
SAW
WHAT
WAS
DONE
THEY
WERE
VERY
SORRY
AND
CAME
AND
TOLD
UNTO
THEIR
LORD
ALL
THAT
WAS
DONE
THEN
HIS
LORD
AFTER
THAT
HE
HAD
CALLED
HIM
SAID
UNTO
HIM
O
THOU
WICKED
SERVANT
I
FORGAVE
THEE
ALL
THAT
DEBT
BECAUSE
THOU
DESIREDST
ME
SHOULDEST
NOT
THOU
ALSO
HAVE
HAD
COMPASSION
ON
THY
FELLOWSERVANT
EVEN
AS
I
HAD
PITY
ON
THEE
AND
HIS
LORD
WAS
WROTH
AND
DELIVERED
HIM
TO
THE
TORMENTORS
TILL
HE
SHOULD
PAY
ALL
THAT
WAS
DUE
UNTO
HIM
SO
LIKEWISE
SHALL
MY
HEAVENLY
FATHER
DO
ALSO
UNTO
YOU
IF
YE
FROM
YOUR
HEARTS
FORGIVE
NOT
EVERY
ONE
HIS
BROTHER
THEIR
TRESPASSES
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
JESUS
HAD
FINISHED
THESE
SAYINGS
HE
DEPARTED
FROM
GALILEE
AND
CAME
INTO
THE
COASTS
OF
JUDAEA
BEYOND
JORDAN
AND
GREAT
MULTITUDES
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
HE
HEALED
THEM
THERE
THE
PHARISEES
ALSO
CAME
UNTO
HIM
TEMPTING
HIM
AND
SAYING
UNTO
HIM
IS
IT
LAWFUL
FOR
A
MAN
TO
PUT
AWAY
HIS
WIFE
FOR
EVERY
CAUSE
AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
HAVE
YE
NOT
READ
THAT
HE
WHICH
MADE
THEM
AT
THE
BEGINNING
MADE
THEM
MALE
AND
FEMALE
AND
SAID
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
SHALL
A
MAN
LEAVE
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
AND
SHALL
CLEAVE
TO
HIS
WIFE
AND
THEY
TWAIN
SHALL
BE
ONE
FLESH
WHEREFORE
THEY
ARE
NO
MORE
TWAIN
BUT
ONE
FLESH
WHAT
THEREFORE
GOD
HATH
JOINED
TOGETHER
LET
NOT
MAN
PUT
ASUNDER
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
WHY
DID
MOSES
THEN
COMMAND
TO
GIVE
A
WRITING
OF
DIVORCEMENT
AND
TO
PUT

HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
MOSES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HARDNESS
OF
YOUR
HEARTS
SUFFERED
YOU
TO
PUT
AWAY
YOUR
WIVES
BUT
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
IT
WAS
NOT
SO
AND
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
WHOSOEVER

PUT
AWAY
HIS
WIFE
EXCEPT

BE
FOR
FORNICATION
AND
SHALL
MARRY
ANOTHER
COMMITTETH
ADULTERY
AND
WHOSO
MARRIETH
HER
WHICH

DOTH
COMMIT
ADULTERY
HIS
DISCIPLES
SAY
UNTO
HIM
IF
THE
CASE
OF
THE
MAN
BE
SO
WITH
HIS
WIFE
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
MARRY
BUT
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
ALL
MEN
CANNOT
RECEIVE
THIS
SAYING
SAVE
THEY
TO
WHOM
IT
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THERE
ARE
SOME
EUNUCHS
WHICH
WERE
SO
BORN
FROM
THEIR
MOTHER'S
WOMB
AND
THERE
ARE
SOME
EUNUCHS
WHICH
WERE
MADE
EUNUCHS
OF
MEN
AND
THERE
BE
EUNUCHS
WHICH
HAVE
MADE
THEMSELVES
EUNUCHS
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN'S
SAKE
HE
THAT
IS
ABLE
TO
RECEIVE
IT
LET
HIM
RECEIVE
IT
THEN
WERE
THERE
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
LITTLE
CHILDREN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
PUT
HIS
HANDS
ON
THEM
AND
PRAY
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
REBUKED
THEM
BUT
JESUS
SAID
SUFFER
LITTLE
CHILDREN
AND
FORBID
THEM
NOT
TO
COME
UNTO
ME
FOR
OF
SUCH
IS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
AND
HE
LAID
HIS
HANDS
ON
THEM
AND
DEPARTED
THENCE
AND
BEHOLD
ONE
CAME
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
GOOD
MASTER
WHAT
GOOD
THING
SHALL
I
DO
THAT
I
MAY
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHY
CALLEST
THOU
ME
GOOD
THERE
IS
NONE
GOOD
BUT
ONE
THAT
IS
GOD
BUT
IF
THOU
WILT
ENTER
INTO
LIFE
KEEP
THE
COMMANDMENTS
HE
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
WHICH
JESUS
SAID
THOU
SHALT
DO
NO
MURDER
THOU
SHALT
NOT
COMMIT
ADULTERY
THOU
SHALT
NOT
STEAL
THOU
SHALT
NOT
BEAR
FALSE
WITNESS
HONOUR
THY
FATHER
AND
THY
MOTHER
AND
THOU
SHALT
LOVE
THY
NEIGHBOUR
AS
THYSELF
THE
YOUNG
MAN
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
ALL
THESE
THINGS
HAVE
I
KEPT
FROM
MY
YOUTH
UP
WHAT
LACK
I
YET
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
IF
THOU
WILT
BE
PERFECT
GO
AND
SELL
THAT
THOU
HAST
AND
GIVE
TO
THE
POOR
AND
THOU
SHALT
HAVE
TREASURE
IN
HEAVEN
AND
COME
AND
FOLLOW
ME
BUT
WHEN
THE
YOUNG
MAN
HEARD
THAT
SAYING
HE
WENT
AWAY
SORROWFUL
FOR
HE
HAD
GREAT
POSSESSIONS
THEN
SAID
JESUS
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
A
RICH
MAN
SHALL
HARDLY
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
AND
AGAIN
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
IT
IS
EASIER
FOR
A
CAMEL
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
EYE
OF
A
NEEDLE
THAN
FOR
A
RICH
MAN
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
WHEN
HIS
DISCIPLES
HEARD
IT
THEY
WERE
EXCEEDINGLY
AMAZED
SAYING
WHO
THEN
CAN
BE
SAVED
BUT
JESUS
BEHELD
THEM
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WITH
MEN
THIS
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
WITH
GOD
ALL
THINGS
ARE
POSSIBLE
THEN
ANSWERED
PETER
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
BEHOLD
WE
HAVE
FORSAKEN
ALL
AND
FOLLOWED
THEE
WHAT
SHALL
WE
HAVE
THEREFORE
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
YE
WHICH
HAVE
FOLLOWED
ME
IN
THE
REGENERATION
WHEN
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
SIT
IN
THE
THRONE
OF
HIS
GLORY
YE
ALSO
SHALL
SIT
UPON
TWELVE
THRONES
JUDGING
THE
TWELVE
TRIBES
OF
ISRAEL
AND
EVERY
ONE
THAT
HATH
FORSAKEN
HOUSES
OR
BRETHREN
OR
SISTERS
OR
FATHER
OR
MOTHER
OR
WIFE
OR
CHILDREN
OR
LANDS
FOR
MY
NAME'S
SAKE
SHALL
RECEIVE
AN
HUNDREDFOLD
AND
SHALL
INHERIT
EVERLASTING
LIFE
BUT
MANY
THAT
ARE
FIRST
SHALL
BE
LAST
AND
THE
LAST
SHALL
BE
FIRST
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
LIKE
UNTO
A
MAN
THAT
IS
AN
HOUSEHOLDER
WHICH
WENT
OUT
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
TO
HIRE
LABOURERS
INTO
HIS
VINEYARD
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
AGREED
WITH
THE
LABOURERS
FOR
A
PENNY
A
DAY
HE
SENT
THEM
INTO
HIS
VINEYARD
AND
HE
WENT
OUT
ABOUT
THE
THIRD
HOUR
AND
SAW
OTHERS
STANDING
IDLE
IN
THE
MARKETPLACE
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GO
YE
ALSO
INTO
THE
VINEYARD
AND
WHATSOEVER
IS
RIGHT
I
WILL
GIVE
YOU
AND
THEY
WENT
THEIR
WAY
AGAIN
HE
WENT
OUT
ABOUT
THE
SIXTH
AND
NINTH
HOUR
AND
DID
LIKEWISE
AND
ABOUT
THE
ELEVENTH
HOUR
HE
WENT
OUT
AND
FOUND
OTHERS
STANDING
IDLE
AND
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
WHY
STAND
YE
HERE
ALL
THE
DAY
IDLE
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
BECAUSE
NO
MAN
HATH
HIRED
US
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
GO
YE
ALSO
INTO
THE
VINEYARD
AND
WHATSOEVER
IS
RIGHT
THAT
SHALL
YE
RECEIVE
SO
WHEN
EVEN
WAS
COME
THE
LORD
OF
THE
VINEYARD
SAITH
UNTO
HIS
STEWARD
CALL
THE
LABOURERS
AND
GIVE
THEM
THEIR
HIRE
BEGINNING
FROM
THE
LAST
UNTO
THE
FIRST
AND
WHEN
THEY
CAME
THAT
WERE
HIRED
ABOUT
THE
ELEVENTH
HOUR
THEY
RECEIVED
EVERY
MAN
A
PENNY
BUT
WHEN
THE
FIRST
CAME
THEY
SUPPOSED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
RECEIVED
MORE
AND
THEY
LIKEWISE
RECEIVED
EVERY
MAN
A
PENNY
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
RECEIVED
IT
THEY
MURMURED
AGAINST
THE
GOODMAN
OF
THE
HOUSE
SAYING
THESE
LAST
HAVE
WROUGHT
BUT
ONE
HOUR
AND
THOU
HAST
MADE
THEM
EQUAL
UNTO
US
WHICH
HAVE
BORNE
THE
BURDEN
AND
HEAT
OF
THE
DAY
BUT
HE
ANSWERED
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
SAID
FRIEND
I
DO
THEE
NO
WRONG
DIDST
NOT
THOU
AGREE
WITH
ME
FOR
A
PENNY
TAKE
THAT
THINE
IS
AND
GO
THY
WAY
I
WILL
GIVE
UNTO
THIS
LAST
EVEN
AS
UNTO
THEE
IS
IT
NOT
LAWFUL
FOR
ME
TO
DO
WHAT
I
WILL
WITH
MINE
OWN
IS
THINE
EYE
EVIL
BECAUSE
I
AM
GOOD
SO
THE
LAST
SHALL
BE
FIRST
AND
THE
FIRST
LAST
FOR
MANY
BE
CALLED
BUT
FEW
CHOSEN
AND
JESUS
GOING
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
TOOK
THE
TWELVE
DISCIPLES
APART
IN
THE
WAY
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
BEHOLD
WE
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
BE
BETRAYED
UNTO
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
UNTO
THE
SCRIBES
AND
THEY
SHALL
CONDEMN
HIM
TO
DEATH
AND
SHALL
DELIVER
HIM
TO
THE
GENTILES
TO
MOCK
AND
TO
SCOURGE
AND
TO
CRUCIFY
HIM
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
SHALL
RISE
AGAIN
THEN
CAME
TO
HIM
THE
MOTHER
OF
ZEBEDEES
CHILDREN
WITH
HER
SONS
WORSHIPPING
HIM
AND
DESIRING
A
CERTAIN
THING
OF
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
HER
WHAT
WILT
THOU
SHE
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
GRANT
THAT
THESE
MY
TWO
SONS
MAY
SIT
THE
ONE
ON
THY
RIGHT
HAND
AND
THE
OTHER
ON
THE
LEFT
IN
THY
KINGDOM
BUT
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
YE
KNOW
NOT
WHAT
YE
ASK
ARE
YE
ABLE
TO
DRINK
OF
THE
CUP
THAT
I
SHALL
DRINK
OF
AND
TO
BE
BAPTIZED
WITH
THE
BAPTISM
THAT
I
AM
BAPTIZED
WITH
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
WE
ARE
ABLE
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
YE
SHALL
DRINK
INDEED
OF
MY
CUP
AND
BE
BAPTIZED
WITH
THE
BAPTISM
THAT
I
AM
BAPTIZED
WITH
BUT
TO
SIT
ON
MY
RIGHT
HAND
AND
ON
MY
LEFT
IS
NOT
MINE
TO
GIVE
BUT
IT
SHALL
BE
GIVEN
TO
THEM
FOR
WHOM
IT
IS
PREPARED
OF
MY
FATHER
AND
WHEN
THE
TEN
HEARD
IT
THEY
WERE
MOVED
WITH
INDIGNATION
AGAINST
THE
TWO
BRETHREN
BUT
JESUS
CALLED
THEM
UNTO
HIM
AND
SAID
YE
KNOW
THAT
THE
PRINCES
OF
THE
GENTILES
EXERCISE
DOMINION
OVER
THEM
AND
THEY
THAT
ARE
GREAT
EXERCISE
AUTHORITY
UPON
THEM
BUT
IT
SHALL
NOT
BE
SO
AMONG
YOU
BUT
WHOSOEVER
WILL
BE
GREAT
AMONG
YOU
LET
HIM
BE
YOUR
MINISTER
AND
WHOSOEVER
WILL
BE
CHIEF
AMONG
YOU
LET
HIM
BE
YOUR
SERVANT
EVEN
AS
THE
SON
OF
MAN
CAME
NOT
TO
BE
MINISTERED
UNTO
BUT
TO
MINISTER
AND
TO
GIVE
HIS
LIFE
A
RANSOM
FOR
MANY
AND
AS
THEY
DEPARTED
FROM

A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
FOLLOWED

UNTO

THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM

HAD
COMPASSION
ON
THEM
AND
TOUCHED
THEIR
EYES
AND
IMMEDIATELY
THEIR
EYES
RECEIVED
SIGHT
AND
THEY
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
WHEN
THEY
DREW
NIGH
UNTO
JERUSALEM
AND
WERE

MORNING
AS

THEY
MARVELLED
SAYING
HOW

WITHERED
AWAY
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO

VERILY
I

UNTO
YOU
IF

FAITH
AND
DOUBT
NOT

THE
SEA
IT
SHALL
BE
DONE
AND
ALL
THINGS
WHATSOEVER
YE
SHALL
ASK
IN
PRAYER
BELIEVING

RECEIVE
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
THE
ELDERS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
CAME
UNTO
HIM
AS

THE
BAPTISM
OF
JOHN
WHENCE
WAS
IT
FROM
HEAVEN
OR
OF
MEN
AND
THEY
REASONED
WITH
THEMSELVES
SAYING
IF
WE
SHALL
SAY
FROM
HEAVEN
HE
WILL
SAY
UNTO
US
WHY
DID
YE
NOT
THEN
BELIEVE
HIM
BUT
IF
WE
SHALL
SAY
OF
MEN
WE

THE
PEOPLE
FOR

HOLD
JOHN
AS
A
PROPHET
AND
THEY
ANSWERED
JESUS
AND
SAID
WE
CANNOT
TELL
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
NEITHER
TELL
I
YOU
BY
WHAT
AUTHORITY
I
DO
THESE
THINGS
BUT
WHAT
THINK
YE
A
CERTAIN
MAN
HAD
TWO
SONS
AND
HE
CAME
TO
THE
FIRST
AND
SAID
SON
GO
WORK
TO
DAY
IN
MY
VINEYARD
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
I
WILL
NOT
BUT
AFTERWARD
HE
REPENTED
AND
WENT
AND
HE
CAME
TO
THE
SECOND
AND
SAID
LIKEWISE
AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
I
GO
SIR
AND
WENT
NOT
WHETHER
OF
THEM
TWAIN
DID
THE
WILL
OF
HIS
FATHER
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
THE
FIRST
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
THE
PUBLICANS
AND
THE
HARLOTS
GO
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
BEFORE
YOU
FOR
JOHN
CAME
UNTO
YOU
IN
THE
WAY
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
YE
BELIEVED
HIM
NOT
BUT
THE
PUBLICANS
AND
THE
HARLOTS
BELIEVED
HIM
AND
YE
WHEN
YE
HAD
SEEN
IT
REPENTED
NOT
AFTERWARD
THAT
YE
MIGHT
BELIEVE
HIM
HEAR
ANOTHER
PARABLE
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
HOUSEHOLDER
WHICH
PLANTED
A
VINEYARD
AND
HEDGED
IT
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
DIGGED
A
WINEPRESS
IN
IT
AND
BUILT
A
TOWER
AND
LET
IT
OUT
TO
HUSBANDMEN
AND
WENT
INTO
A
FAR
COUNTRY
AND
WHEN
THE
TIME
OF
THE
FRUIT
DREW
NEAR
HE
SENT
HIS
SERVANTS
TO
THE
HUSBANDMEN
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE
FRUITS
OF
IT
AND
THE
HUSBANDMEN
TOOK
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
BEAT
ONE
AND
KILLED
ANOTHER
AND
STONED
ANOTHER
AGAIN
HE
SENT
OTHER
SERVANTS
MORE
THAN
THE
FIRST
AND
THEY
DID
UNTO
THEM
LIKEWISE
BUT
LAST
OF
ALL
HE
SENT
UNTO
THEM
HIS
SON
SAYING
THEY
WILL
REVERENCE
MY
SON
BUT
WHEN
THE
HUSBANDMEN
SAW
THE
SON
THEY
SAID
AMONG
THEMSELVES
THIS
IS
THE
HEIR
COME
LET
US
KILL
HIM
AND
LET
US
SEIZE
ON
HIS
INHERITANCE
AND
THEY
CAUGHT
HIM
AND
CAST
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
VINEYARD
AND
SLEW
HIM
WHEN
THE
LORD
THEREFORE
OF
THE
VINEYARD
COMETH
WHAT
WILL
HE
DO
UNTO
THOSE
HUSBANDMEN
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
HE
WILL
MISERABLY
DESTROY
THOSE
WICKED
MEN
AND
WILL
LET
OUT
HIS
VINEYARD
UNTO
OTHER
HUSBANDMEN
WHICH
SHALL
RENDER
HIM
THE
FRUITS
IN
THEIR
SEASONS
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
DID
YE
NEVER
READ
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
THE
STONE
WHICH
THE
BUILDERS
REJECTED
THE
SAME
IS
BECOME
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
CORNER
THIS
IS
THE
LORD'S
DOING
AND
IT
IS
MARVELLOUS
IN
OUR
EYES
THEREFORE
SAY
I
UNTO
YOU
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
FROM
YOU
AND
GIVEN
TO
A
NATION
BRINGING
FORTH
THE
FRUITS
THEREOF
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
FALL
ON
THIS
STONE
SHALL
BE
BROKEN
BUT
ON
WHOMSOEVER
IT
SHALL
FALL
IT
WILL
GRIND
HIM
TO
POWDER
AND
WHEN
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
PHARISEES
HAD
HEARD
HIS
PARABLES
THEY
PERCEIVED
THAT
HE
SPAKE
OF
THEM
BUT
WHEN
THEY
SOUGHT
TO
LAY
HANDS
ON
HIM
THEY
FEARED
THE
MULTITUDE
BECAUSE
THEY
TOOK
HIM
FOR
A
PROPHET
AND
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
AGAIN
BY
PARABLES
AND
SAID
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
LIKE
UNTO
A
CERTAIN
KING
WHICH
MADE
A
MARRIAGE
FOR
HIS
SON
AND
SENT
FORTH
HIS
SERVANTS
TO
CALL
THEM
THAT
WERE
BIDDEN
TO
THE
WEDDING
AND
THEY
WOULD
NOT
COME
AGAIN
HE
SENT
FORTH
OTHER
SERVANTS
SAYING
TELL
THEM
WHICH
ARE
BIDDEN
BEHOLD
I
HAVE
PREPARED
MY
DINNER
MY
OXEN
AND
MY
FATLINGS
ARE
KILLED
AND
ALL
THINGS
ARE
READY
COME
UNTO
THE
MARRIAGE
BUT
THEY
MADE
LIGHT
OF
IT
AND
WENT
THEIR
WAYS
ONE
TO
HIS
FARM
ANOTHER
TO
HIS
MERCHANDISE
AND
THE
REMNANT
TOOK
HIS
SERVANTS
AND
ENTREATED
THEM
SPITEFULLY
AND
SLEW
THEM
BUT
WHEN
THE
KING
HEARD
THEREOF
HE
WAS
WROTH
AND
HE
SENT
FORTH
HIS
ARMIES
AND
DESTROYED
THOSE
MURDERERS
AND
BURNED
UP
THEIR
CITY
THEN
SAITH
HE
TO
HIS
SERVANTS
THE
WEDDING
IS
READY
BUT
THEY
WHICH
WERE
BIDDEN
WERE
NOT
WORTHY
GO
YE
THEREFORE
INTO
THE
HIGHWAYS
AND
AS
MANY
AS
YE
SHALL
FIND
BID
TO
THE
MARRIAGE
SO
THOSE
SERVANTS
WENT
OUT
INTO
THE
HIGHWAYS
AND
GATHERED
TOGETHER
ALL
AS
MANY
AS
THEY
FOUND
BOTH
BAD
AND
GOOD
AND
THE
WEDDING
WAS
FURNISHED
WITH
GUESTS
AND
WHEN
THE
KING
CAME
IN
TO
SEE
THE
GUESTS
HE
SAW
THERE
A
MAN
WHICH
HAD
NOT
ON
A
WEDDING
GARMENT
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
FRIEND
HOW
CAMEST
THOU
IN
HITHER
NOT
HAVING
A
WEDDING
GARMENT
AND
HE
WAS
SPEECHLESS
THEN
SAID
THE
KING
TO
THE
SERVANTS
BIND
HIM
HAND
AND
FOOT
AND
TAKE
HIM
AWAY
AND
CAST
HIM
INTO
OUTER
DARKNESS
THERE
SHALL
BE
WEEPING
AND
GNASHING
OF
TEETH
FOR
MANY
ARE
CALLED
BUT
FEW
ARE
CHOSEN
THEN
WENT
THE
PHARISEES
AND
TOOK
COUNSEL
HOW
THEY
MIGHT
ENTANGLE
HIM
IN
HIS
TALK
AND
THEY
SENT
OUT
UNTO
HIM
THEIR
DISCIPLES
WITH
THE
HERODIANS
SAYING
MASTER
WE
KNOW
THAT
THOU
ART
TRUE
AND
TEACHEST
THE
WAY
OF
GOD
IN
TRUTH
NEITHER
CAREST
THOU
FOR
ANY
MAN
FOR
THOU
REGARDEST
NOT
THE
PERSON
OF
MEN
TELL
US
THEREFORE
WHAT
THINKEST
THOU
IS
IT
LAWFUL
TO
GIVE
TRIBUTE
UNTO
CAESAR
OR
NOT
BUT
JESUS
PERCEIVED
THEIR
WICKEDNESS
AND
SAID
WHY
TEMPT
YE
ME
YE
HYPOCRITES
SHEW
ME
THE
TRIBUTE
MONEY
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
A
PENNY
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
WHOSE
IS
THIS
IMAGE
AND
SUPERSCRIPTION
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
CAESAR'S
THEN
SAITH
HE
UNTO
THEM
RENDER
THEREFORE
UNTO
CAESAR
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
CAESAR'S
AND
UNTO
GOD
THE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
GOD'S
WHEN
THEY
HAD
HEARD
THESE
WORDS
THEY
MARVELLED
AND
LEFT
HIM
AND
WENT
THEIR
WAY
THE
SAME
DAY
CAME
TO
HIM
THE
SADDUCEES
WHICH
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
RESURRECTION
AND
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
MASTER
MOSES
SAID
IF
A
MAN
DIE
HAVING
NO
CHILDREN
HIS
BROTHER
SHALL
MARRY
HIS
WIFE
AND
RAISE
UP
SEED
UNTO
HIS
BROTHER
NOW
THERE
WERE
WITH
US
SEVEN
BRETHREN
AND
THE
FIRST
WHEN
HE
HAD
MARRIED
A
WIFE
DECEASED
AND
HAVING
NO
ISSUE
LEFT
HIS
WIFE
UNTO
HIS
BROTHER
LIKEWISE
THE
SECOND
ALSO
AND
THE
THIRD
UNTO
THE
SEVENTH
AND
LAST
OF
ALL
THE
WOMAN
DIED
ALSO
THEREFORE
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
WHOSE
WIFE
SHALL
SHE
BE
OF
THE
SEVEN
FOR
THEY
ALL
HAD
HER
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
DO
ERR
NOT
KNOWING
THE
SCRIPTURES
NOR
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
FOR
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
THEY
NEITHER
MARRY
NOR
ARE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
BUT
ARE
AS
THE
ANGELS
OF
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
BUT
AS
TOUCHING
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
HAVE
YE
NOT
READ
THAT
WHICH
WAS
SPOKEN
UNTO
YOU
BY
GOD
SAYING
I
AM
THE
GOD
OF
ABRAHAM
AND
THE
GOD
OF
ISAAC
AND
THE
GOD
OF
JACOB
GOD
IS
NOT
THE
GOD
OF
THE
DEAD
BUT
OF
THE
LIVING
AND
WHEN
THE
MULTITUDE
HEARD
THIS
THEY
WERE
ASTONISHED
AT
HIS
DOCTRINE
BUT
WHEN
THE
PHARISEES
HAD
HEARD
THAT
HE
HAD
PUT
THE
SADDUCEES
TO
SILENCE
THEY
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
THEN
ONE
OF
THEM
WHICH
WAS
A
LAWYER
ASKED
HIM
A
QUESTION
TEMPTING
HIM
AND
SAYING
MASTER
WHICH
IS
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
IN
THE
LAW
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
SHALT
LOVE
THE
LORD
THY
GOD
WITH
ALL
THY
HEART
AND
WITH
ALL
THY
SOUL
AND
WITH
ALL
THY

THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
AND
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
AND
THE
SECOND
IS

THOU
SHALT
LOVE
THY
NEIGHBOUR
AS
THYSELF
ON
THESE
TWO
COMMANDMENTS
HANG
ALL
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
WHILE
THE
PHARISEES
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
JESUS
ASKED
THEM
SAYING
WHAT
THINK
YE
OF
CHRIST
WHOSE
SON
IS
HE
THEY
SAY
UNTO
HIM
THE
SON
OF
DAVID
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
HOW
THEN
DOTH
DAVID
IN

SAYING
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO

ABLE
TO
ANSWER
HIM
A
WORD
NEITHER
DURST
ANY
MAN
FROM
THAT
DAY
FORTH
ASK
HIM
ANY
MORE
QUESTIONS
THEN
SPAKE
JESUS
TO
THE
MULTITUDE
AND

RISING
UP
A

TO
THE
PRIEST
AND
OFFER
FOR
THY
CLEANSING
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
MOSES
COMMANDED
FOR
A
TESTIMONY
UNTO
THEM
BUT
HE
WENT
OUT
AND
BEGAN
TO
PUBLISH
IT
MUCH
AND
TO
BLAZE
ABROAD
THE
MATTER
INSOMUCH
THAT
JESUS
COULD
NO
MORE
OPENLY
ENTER
INTO
THE
CITY
BUT
WAS
WITHOUT
IN
DESERT
PLACES
AND
THEY
CAME
TO
HIM
FROM
EVERY
QUARTER
AND
AGAIN
HE
ENTERED
INTO
CAPERNAUM
AFTER
SOME
DAYS
AND
IT
WAS
NOISED
THAT
HE
WAS
IN
THE
HOUSE
AND
STRAIGHTWAY
MANY
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
INSOMUCH
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
ROOM
TO
RECEIVE
THEM
NO
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
ABOUT

DOOR
AND
HE
PREACHED
THE
WORD
UNTO
THEM
AND
THEY
COME
UNTO
HIM
BRINGING
ONE
SICK
OF
THE
PALSY
WHICH
WAS
BORNE
OF
FOUR

WHEN
THEY
COULD
NOT
COME
NIGH
UNTO
HIM
FOR
THE
PRESS
THEY
UNCOVERED
THE
ROOF
WHERE
HE
WAS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
BROKEN
IT
UP
THEY
LET
DOWN
THE
BED
WHEREIN
THE
SICK

WHEN
JESUS
SAW

AND
IMMEDIATELY
WHEN
JESUS
PERCEIVED
IN
HIS
SPIRIT
THAT
THEY
SO
REASONED
WITHIN
THEMSELVES
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
REASON
YE
THESE
THINGS
IN
YOUR
HEARTS
WHETHER

IT
EASIER
TO
SAY
TO
THE
SICK

THE
PALSY
THY

BE
FORGIVEN
THEE
OR
TO
SAY
ARISE

SITTING
AT
THE
RECEIPT
OF
CUSTOM
AND
SAID
UNTO

AND
HE
AROSE
AND
FOLLOWED

IN
HIS
HOUSE
MANY
PUBLICANS
AND
SINNERS
SAT
ALSO
TOGETHER
WITH
JESUS
AND
HIS

THEY
SAID
UNTO

OF
THE
PHARISEES
USED
TO
FAST
AND
THEY
COME

SAY
UNTO
HIM
WHY

BRIDEGROOM
IS
WITH

AS
LONG
AS

AND
HE
CALLED
THEM
UNTO

UNTO
THEM
IN
PARABLES
HOW

CAST
OUT
SATAN
AND
IF
A

THAT

AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
BEHOLD

HE
ANSWERED
THEM
SAYING

AND
HE
LOOKED
ROUND
ABOUT
ON
THEM
WHICH

BRETHREN
FOR
WHOSOEVER

AND
HE
BEGAN
AGAIN
TO

BY
THE
SEA
SIDE
AND
THERE
WAS
GATHERED
UNTO
HIM
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
SO
THAT
HE
ENTERED
INTO
A
SHIP
AND
SAT
IN
THE
SEA
AND
THE
WHOLE
MULTITUDE
WAS
BY
THE
SEA
ON
THE
LAND
AND
HE
TAUGHT
THEM
MANY
THINGS
BY
PARABLES
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IN
HIS
DOCTRINE
HEARKEN
BEHOLD
THERE
WENT
OUT
A
SOWER
TO
SOW
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
SOWED
SOME
FELL
BY
THE
WAY
SIDE
AND
THE
FOWLS
OF
THE
AIR
CAME
AND
DEVOURED
IT
UP
AND
SOME
FELL
ON
STONY
GROUND
WHERE
IT
HAD
NOT
MUCH
EARTH
AND
IMMEDIATELY
IT
SPRANG
UP
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
NO
DEPTH
OF
EARTH
BUT
WHEN
THE
SUN
WAS
UP
IT
WAS
SCORCHED
AND
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
NO
ROOT
IT
WITHERED
AWAY
AND
SOME
FELL
AMONG
THORNS
AND
THE
THORNS
GREW
UP
AND
CHOKED
IT
AND
IT
YIELDED
NO
FRUIT
AND
OTHER
FELL
ON
GOOD
GROUND
AND
DID
YIELD
FRUIT
THAT
SPRANG
UP
AND
INCREASED
AND
BROUGHT
FORTH
SOME
THIRTY
AND
SOME
SIXTY
AND
SOME
AN

AND
HE
SAID
UNTO

THE
MYSTERY
OF
THE

BUT
UNTO
THEM
THAT

ARE
DONE
IN

THAT
SEEING
THEY
MAY
SEE
AND
NOT
PERCEIVE
AND
HEARING
THEY
MAY
HEAR
AND
NOT
UNDERSTAND
LEST
AT
ANY
TIME
THEY
SHOULD
BE
CONVERTED
AND
THEIR
SINS
SHOULD
BE
FORGIVEN
THEM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
KNOW

NOT
THIS
PARABLE
AND
HOW
THEN
WILL
YE
KNOW
ALL
PARABLES
THE
SOWER
SOWETH
THE
WORD
AND
THESE
ARE
THEY
BY
THE
WAY
SIDE
WHERE
THE
WORD
IS
SOWN
BUT
WHEN
THEY
HAVE
HEARD
SATAN
COMETH
IMMEDIATELY
AND
TAKETH
AWAY
THE
WORD
THAT
WAS
SOWN
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
AND
THESE
ARE
THEY
LIKEWISE
WHICH
ARE
SOWN
ON
STONY
GROUND
WHO
WHEN
THEY
HAVE
HEARD
THE
WORD
IMMEDIATELY
RECEIVE
IT
WITH
GLADNESS
AND
HAVE
NO
ROOT
IN
THEMSELVES
AND
SO
ENDURE
BUT
FOR
A
TIME
AFTERWARD
WHEN
AFFLICTION
OR
PERSECUTION
ARISETH
FOR
THE
WORD'S
SAKE
IMMEDIATELY
THEY
ARE
OFFENDED
AND
THESE
ARE
THEY
WHICH
ARE
SOWN
AMONG
THORNS
SUCH
AS
HEAR
THE
WORD
AND
THE
CARES
OF
THIS
WORLD
AND
THE
DECEITFULNESS
OF
RICHES
AND
THE
LUSTS
OF
OTHER
THINGS
ENTERING
IN
CHOKE
THE
WORD
AND
IT
BECOMETH
UNFRUITFUL
AND
THESE
ARE
THEY
WHICH
ARE
SOWN
ON
GOOD
GROUND
SUCH
AS
HEAR
THE
WORD
AND
RECEIVE
IT
AND
BRING
FORTH
FRUIT
SOME
THIRTYFOLD
SOME
SIXTY
AND
SOME
AN
HUNDRED
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IS
A
CANDLE
BROUGHT
TO
BE
PUT
UNDER
A
BUSHEL
OR
UNDER
A
BED
AND
NOT
TO
BE
SET
ON
A
CANDLESTICK
FOR
THERE
IS
NOTHING
HID
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
BE
MANIFESTED
NEITHER
WAS
ANY
THING
KEPT
SECRET
BUT
THAT
IT
SHOULD
COME
ABROAD
IF
ANY
MAN
HAVE
EARS
TO
HEAR
LET
HIM
HEAR
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
TAKE
HEED
WHAT
YE
HEAR
WITH
WHAT
MEASURE
YE
METE
IT
SHALL
BE
MEASURED
TO
YOU
AND
UNTO
YOU
THAT
HEAR
SHALL
MORE
BE
GIVEN
FOR
HE
THAT
HATH
TO
HIM
SHALL
BE
GIVEN
AND
HE
THAT
HATH
NOT
FROM
HIM
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
EVEN
THAT
WHICH
HE
HATH
AND
HE
SAID
SO
IS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AS
IF
A
MAN
SHOULD
CAST
SEED
INTO
THE
GROUND
AND
SHOULD
SLEEP
AND
RISE
NIGHT
AND
DAY
AND
THE
SEED
SHOULD
SPRING
AND
GROW
UP
HE
KNOWETH
NOT
HOW
FOR
THE
EARTH
BRINGETH
FORTH
FRUIT
OF
HERSELF
FIRST
THE
BLADE
THEN
THE
EAR
AFTER
THAT
THE
FULL
CORN
IN
THE
EAR
BUT
WHEN
THE
FRUIT
IS
BROUGHT
FORTH
IMMEDIATELY
HE
PUTTETH
IN
THE
SICKLE
BECAUSE
THE
HARVEST
IS
COME
AND
HE
SAID
WHEREUNTO
SHALL
WE
LIKEN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
OR
WITH
WHAT
COMPARISON
SHALL
WE
COMPARE
IT
IT
IS
LIKE
A
GRAIN
OF
MUSTARD
SEED
WHICH
WHEN
IT
IS
SOWN
IN
THE
EARTH
IS
LESS
THAN
ALL
THE
SEEDS
THAT
BE
IN
THE
EARTH
BUT
WHEN
IT
IS
SOWN
IT
GROWETH
UP
AND
BECOMETH
GREATER
THAN
ALL
HERBS
AND
SHOOTETH
OUT
GREAT
BRANCHES
SO
THAT
THE
FOWLS
OF
THE
AIR
MAY
LODGE
UNDER
THE
SHADOW
OF
IT
AND
WITH
MANY
SUCH
PARABLES
SPAKE
HE
THE
WORD
UNTO
THEM
AS
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
HEAR
IT
BUT
WITHOUT
A
PARABLE
SPAKE
HE
NOT
UNTO
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ALONE
HE
EXPOUNDED
ALL
THINGS
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
SAME
DAY
WHEN
THE
EVEN
WAS
COME
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
LET
US
PASS
OVER
UNTO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SENT
AWAY
THE
MULTITUDE
THEY
TOOK
HIM
EVEN
AS
HE
WAS
IN
THE
SHIP
AND
THERE
WERE
ALSO
WITH
HIM
OTHER
LITTLE
SHIPS
AND
THERE
AROSE
A
GREAT
STORM
OF
WIND
AND
THE
WAVES
BEAT
INTO
THE
SHIP
SO
THAT
IT
WAS
NOW
FULL
AND
HE
WAS
IN
THE
HINDER
PART
OF
THE
SHIP
ASLEEP
ON
A
PILLOW
AND
THEY
AWAKE
HIM
AND
SAY
UNTO
HIM
MASTER
CAREST
THOU
NOT
THAT
WE
PERISH
AND
HE
AROSE
AND
REBUKED
THE
WIND
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
SEA
PEACE
BE
STILL
AND
THE
WIND
CEASED
AND
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
CALM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
ARE
YE
SO
FEARFUL
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
YE
HAVE
NO
FAITH
AND
THEY
FEARED
EXCEEDINGLY
AND
SAID
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
WHAT
MANNER
OF
MAN
IS
THIS
THAT
EVEN
THE
WIND
AND
THE
SEA
OBEY
HIM
AND
THEY
CAME
OVER
UNTO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
SEA
INTO
THE
COUNTRY
OF
THE
GADARENES
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
OUT
OF
THE
SHIP
IMMEDIATELY
THERE
MET
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
TOMBS
A
MAN
WITH
AN
UNCLEAN
SPIRIT
WHO
HAD
HIS
DWELLING
AMONG
THE
TOMBS
AND
NO
MAN
COULD
BIND
HIM
NO
NOT
WITH
CHAINS
BECAUSE
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
OFTEN
BOUND
WITH
FETTERS
AND
CHAINS
AND
THE
CHAINS
HAD
BEEN
PLUCKED
ASUNDER
BY
HIM
AND
THE
FETTERS
BROKEN
IN
PIECES
NEITHER
COULD
ANY
MAN
TAME
HIM
AND
ALWAYS
NIGHT
AND
DAY
HE
WAS
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
AND
IN
THE
TOMBS
CRYING
AND
CUTTING
HIMSELF
WITH
STONES
BUT
WHEN
HE
SAW
JESUS
AFAR
OFF
HE
RAN
AND
WORSHIPPED
HIM
AND
CRIED
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
AND
SAID
WHAT
HAVE
I
TO
DO
WITH
THEE
JESUS

SON
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
GOD
I
ADJURE
THEE
BY

SAID
UNTO
HIM
COME
OUT
OF
THE
MAN
THOU
UNCLEAN
SPIRIT
AND
HE
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
IS
THY
NAME
AND
HE
ANSWERED
SAYING
MY
NAME
IS
LEGION
FOR
WE
ARE
MANY
AND
HE
BESOUGHT
HIM
MUCH
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
SEND
THEM
AWAY
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
NOW
THERE
WAS
THERE
NIGH
UNTO
THE

ENTER
INTO
THEM
AND
FORTHWITH

ENTERED
INTO
THE
SWINE
AND
THE
HERD

VIOLENTLY
DOWN

STEEP
PLACE
INTO

SEA
THEY
WERE

SEA
AND
THEY
THAT
FED
THE
SWINE
FLED
AND
TOLD
IT
IN
THE
CITY
AND
IN
THE
COUNTRY
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT

ONE
OF
THE
RULERS
OF
THE

JAIRUS
BY

AND
WHEN

HIM
HE
FELL
AT
HIS

AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
GREATLY
SAYING
MY
LITTLE
DAUGHTER
LIETH
AT
THE
POINT
OF
DEATH
I
PRAY
THEE
COME
AND
LAY
THY
HANDS
ON
HER
THAT
SHE
MAY
BE
HEALED
AND
SHE

LIVE
AND
JESUS
WENT

HIM
AND
MUCH
PEOPLE
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
THRONGED
HIM

A
CERTAIN
WOMAN
WHICH
HAD
AN
ISSUE
OF
BLOOD
TWELVE
YEARS
AND
HAD
SUFFERED
MANY
THINGS
OF
MANY
PHYSICIANS
AND
HAD
SPENT
ALL
THAT
SHE
HAD
AND
WAS
NOTHING
BETTERED
BUT
RATHER
GREW
WORSE
WHEN
SHE
HAD
HEARD
OF
JESUS
CAME
IN
THE
PRESS
BEHIND
AND
TOUCHED
HIS
GARMENT
FOR
SHE
SAID
IF
I
MAY
TOUCH
BUT
HIS
CLOTHES
I
SHALL
BE
WHOLE
AND
STRAIGHTWAY
THE
FOUNTAIN
OF
HER
BLOOD
WAS
DRIED
UP
AND
SHE
FELT
IN
HER
BODY
THAT
SHE
WAS
HEALED
OF
THAT
PLAGUE
AND
JESUS
IMMEDIATELY
KNOWING
IN
HIMSELF
THAT
VIRTUE
HAD
GONE
OUT
OF
HIM
TURNED
HIM
ABOUT
IN
THE
PRESS
AND
SAID
WHO

MY
CLOTHES
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
SEEST
THE
MULTITUDE
THRONGING
THEE
AND
SAYEST
THOU
WHO

ME
AND
HE
LOOKED
ROUND
ABOUT

THIS
THING
BUT
THE
WOMAN
FEARING
AND
TREMBLING
KNOWING
WHAT
WAS
DONE
IN
HER
CAME
AND
FELL
DOWN
BEFORE
HIM
AND
TOLD
HIM
ALL
THE
TRUTH
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
HER
DAUGHTER
THY
FAITH
HATH
MADE
THEE
WHOLE
GO
IN
PEACE
AND
BE
WHOLE
OF
THY
PLAGUE
WHILE

FROM
THE
RULER
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE'S
HOUSE
CERTAIN
WHICH

WHY
TROUBLEST
THOU
THE
MASTER
ANY

THE
WORD
THAT
WAS
SPOKEN
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THE
RULER
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
BE
NOT
AFRAID
ONLY
BELIEVE
AND
HE
SUFFERED
NO
MAN
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
SAVE
PETER
AND
JAMES
AND
JOHN
THE
BROTHER
OF
JAMES
AND
HE
COMETH
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
RULER
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
SEETH
THE
TUMULT
AND
THEM
THAT
WEPT
AND
WAILED
GREATLY
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
IN
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
WHY
MAKE
YE
THIS
ADO
AND
WEEP
THE
DAMSEL
IS
NOT
DEAD
BUT
SLEEPETH
AND
THEY
LAUGHED
HIM
TO
SCORN
BUT
WHEN
HE
HAD
PUT
THEM
ALL
OUT
HE
TAKETH
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
MOTHER
OF
THE
DAMSEL
AND
THEM
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
AND
ENTERETH
IN
WHERE
THE
DAMSEL
WAS
LYING
AND
HE
TOOK
THE
DAMSEL
BY
THE
HAND
AND
SAID
UNTO
HER
TALITHA
CUMI
WHICH
IS
BEING
INTERPRETED
DAMSEL
I
SAY
UNTO
THEE
ARISE
AND
STRAIGHTWAY
THE
DAMSEL
AROSE
AND
WALKED
FOR
SHE
WAS
OF
THE
AGE
OF
TWELVE
YEARS
AND
THEY
WERE
ASTONISHED
WITH
A
GREAT
ASTONISHMENT
AND
HE
CHARGED
THEM
STRAITLY
THAT
NO
MAN
SHOULD
KNOW
IT
AND
COMMANDED
THAT
SOMETHING
SHOULD
BE
GIVEN
HER
TO
EAT
AND
HE
WENT
OUT
FROM
THENCE
AND
CAME
INTO
HIS
OWN
COUNTRY
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
FOLLOW
HIM
AND
WHEN
THE
SABBATH
DAY
WAS
COME
HE
BEGAN
TO
TEACH
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
MANY
HEARING
HIM
WERE
ASTONISHED
SAYING
FROM
WHENCE
HATH
THIS
MAN
THESE
THINGS
AND
WHAT
WISDOM
IS
THIS
WHICH
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
HIM
THAT
EVEN
SUCH
MIGHTY
WORKS
ARE
WROUGHT
BY
HIS
HANDS
IS
NOT
THIS
THE
CARPENTER
THE
SON
OF
MARY
THE
BROTHER
OF
JAMES
AND
JOSES
AND
OF
JUDA
AND
SIMON
AND
ARE
NOT
HIS
SISTERS
HERE
WITH
US
AND
THEY
WERE
OFFENDED
AT
HIM
BUT
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
A
PROPHET
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
HONOUR
BUT
IN
HIS
OWN
COUNTRY
AND
AMONG
HIS
OWN
KIN
AND
IN
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
AND
HE
COULD
THERE
DO
NO
MIGHTY
WORK
SAVE
THAT
HE
LAID
HIS
HANDS
UPON
A
FEW
SICK
FOLK
AND
HEALED
THEM
AND
HE
MARVELLED
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
UNBELIEF
AND
HE
WENT
ROUND
ABOUT
THE
VILLAGES
TEACHING
AND
HE
CALLED
UNTO
HIM
THE
TWELVE
AND
BEGAN
TO
SEND
THEM
FORTH
BY
TWO
AND
TWO
AND
GAVE
THEM
POWER
OVER
UNCLEAN
SPIRITS
AND
COMMANDED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
TAKE
NOTHING
FOR
THEIR
JOURNEY
SAVE
A
STAFF
ONLY
NO
SCRIP
NO
BREAD
NO
MONEY
IN
THEIR
PURSE
BUT
BE
SHOD
WITH
SANDALS
AND
NOT
PUT
ON
TWO
COATS
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IN
WHAT
PLACE
SOEVER
YE
ENTER
INTO
AN
HOUSE
THERE
ABIDE
TILL
YE
DEPART
FROM
THAT
PLACE
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
NOT
RECEIVE
YOU
NOR
HEAR
YOU
WHEN
YE
DEPART
THENCE
SHAKE
OFF
THE
DUST
UNDER
YOUR
FEET
FOR
A
TESTIMONY
AGAINST
THEM
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
IT
SHALL
BE
MORE
TOLERABLE
FOR
SODOM
AND
GOMORRHA
IN
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGMENT
THAN
FOR
THAT
CITY
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
AND
PREACHED
THAT
MEN
SHOULD
REPENT
AND
THEY
CAST
OUT
MANY
DEVILS
AND
ANOINTED
WITH
OIL
MANY
THAT
WERE
SICK
AND
HEALED
THEM
AND
KING
HEROD
HEARD
OF
HIM
FOR
HIS
NAME
WAS
SPREAD
ABROAD
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
WAS
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
THEREFORE
MIGHTY
WORKS
DO
SHEW
FORTH
THEMSELVES
IN
HIM
OTHERS
SAID
THAT
IT
IS
ELIAS
AND
OTHERS
SAID
THAT
IT
IS
A
PROPHET
OR
AS
ONE
OF
THE
PROPHETS
BUT
WHEN
HEROD
HEARD
THEREOF
HE
SAID
IT
IS
JOHN
WHOM
I
BEHEADED

THINGS
AND
BE
REJECTED
OF
THE

SHALL
LOSE
HIS
LIFE
FOR
MY
SAKE
AND
THE
GOSPEL'S
THE

SHALL
SAVE
IT
FOR
WHAT
SHALL
IT
PROFIT
A
MAN
IF
HE
SHALL
GAIN
THE

WHOSOEVER
THEREFORE
SHALL
BE
ASHAMED
OF

AND
OF
MY
WORDS
IN
THIS
ADULTEROUS
AND
SINFUL
GENERATION
OF
HIM
ALSO
SHALL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
ASHAMED
WHEN
HE
COMETH
IN
THE
GLORY
OF
HIS
FATHER
WITH
THE
HOLY
ANGELS
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
THERE

SOME
OF
THEM
THAT
STAND
HERE
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
TASTE
OF
DEATH
TILL
THEY
HAVE
SEEN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
COME
WITH
POWER
AND
AFTER
SIX
DAYS
JESUS
TAKETH
WITH
HIM
PETER
AND
JAMES
AND
JOHN
AND
LEADETH
THEM
UP
INTO
AN
HIGH
MOUNTAIN
APART
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
HE
WAS
TRANSFIGURED
BEFORE
THEM
AND
HIS
RAIMENT
BECAME
SHINING
EXCEEDING
WHITE
AS
SNOW
SO
AS
NO
FULLER
ON
EARTH
CAN
WHITE
THEM
AND
THERE
APPEARED
UNTO
THEM
ELIAS
WITH
MOSES
AND
THEY
WERE
TALKING
WITH
JESUS
AND
PETER
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
TO
JESUS
MASTER
IT
IS
GOOD
FOR
US
TO
BE
HERE
AND
LET
US
MAKE
THREE
TABERNACLES
ONE
FOR
THEE
AND
ONE
FOR
MOSES
AND
ONE
FOR
ELIAS
FOR
HE
WIST
NOT
WHAT
TO
SAY
FOR
THEY
WERE
SORE
AFRAID
AND
THERE
WAS
A
CLOUD
THAT
OVERSHADOWED
THEM
AND
A
VOICE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
CLOUD
SAYING
THIS
IS
MY
BELOVED
SON
HEAR
HIM
AND
SUDDENLY
WHEN
THEY
HAD
LOOKED
ROUND
ABOUT
THEY
SAW
NO
MAN
ANY
MORE
SAVE
JESUS
ONLY
WITH
THEMSELVES
AND
AS
THEY
CAME
DOWN
FROM
THE
MOUNTAIN
HE
CHARGED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
TELL
NO
MAN
WHAT
THINGS
THEY
HAD
SEEN
TILL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
WERE
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
THEY
KEPT
THAT
SAYING
WITH
THEMSELVES
QUESTIONING
ONE
WITH
ANOTHER
WHAT
THE
RISING
FROM
THE
DEAD
SHOULD
MEAN
AND
THEY
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
WHY
SAY
THE
SCRIBES
THAT
ELIAS
MUST
FIRST
COME
AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
TOLD
THEM
ELIAS
VERILY
COMETH
FIRST
AND
RESTORETH
ALL
THINGS
AND
HOW
IT
IS
WRITTEN
OF
THE
SON
OF
MAN
THAT
HE
MUST
SUFFER
MANY
THINGS
AND
BE
SET
AT

BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
ELIAS
IS
INDEED
COME
AND
THEY
HAVE
DONE
UNTO
HIM
WHATSOEVER
THEY
LISTED
AS

IS
WRITTEN
OF
HIM
AND
WHEN
HE
CAME
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
HE
SAW
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
ABOUT
THEM
AND
THE
SCRIBES
QUESTIONING
WITH
THEM
AND
STRAIGHTWAY
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
BEHELD
HIM
WERE
GREATLY
AMAZED
AND
RUNNING
TO
HIM
SALUTED
HIM
AND
HE
ASKED
THE
SCRIBES
WHAT
QUESTION

THEM
AND
ONE
OF
THE
MULTITUDE
ANSWERED

WITH
TEARS
LORD

AND
THE
SPIRIT
CRIED
AND
RENT
HIM
SORE
AND
CAME
OUT
OF
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
AS
ONE
DEAD
INSOMUCH
THAT
MANY
SAID
HE

BUT
JESUS
TOOK
HIM
BY
THE
HAND
AND
LIFTED
HIM
UP
AND
HE
AROSE
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
INTO
THE
HOUSE
HIS
DISCIPLES
ASKED
HIM
PRIVATELY
WHY
COULD
NOT
WE
CAST
HIM
OUT
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THIS
KIND
CAN
COME
FORTH
BY
NOTHING
BUT
BY
PRAYER
AND
FASTING
AND
THEY
DEPARTED
THENCE
AND
PASSED
THROUGH
GALILEE
AND
HE
WOULD
NOT
THAT
ANY
MAN
SHOULD
KNOW
IT
FOR
HE
TAUGHT
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THE
SON
OF
MAN
IS
DELIVERED
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
MEN
AND
THEY
SHALL
KILL
HIM
AND
AFTER
THAT
HE
IS
KILLED
HE
SHALL
RISE
THE
THIRD
DAY
BUT
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
NOT
THAT
SAYING
AND
WERE
AFRAID
TO
ASK
HIM
AND
HE
CAME
TO
CAPERNAUM
AND
BEING
IN
THE
HOUSE
HE
ASKED
THEM
WHAT
WAS
IT
THAT
YE
DISPUTED
AMONG
YOURSELVES
BY
THE
WAY
BUT
THEY
HELD
THEIR
PEACE
FOR
BY
THE
WAY
THEY
HAD
DISPUTED
AMONG
THEMSELVES
WHO
SHOULD
BE
THE
GREATEST
AND
HE
SAT
DOWN
AND
CALLED
THE
TWELVE
AND
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
IF
ANY
MAN
DESIRE
TO
BE
FIRST
THE
SAME
SHALL
BE
LAST
OF
ALL
AND
SERVANT
OF
ALL
AND
HE
TOOK
A
CHILD
AND
SET
HIM
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
TAKEN
HIM
IN
HIS
ARMS
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
RECEIVE
ONE
OF
SUCH
CHILDREN
IN
MY
NAME
RECEIVETH
ME
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
RECEIVE
ME
RECEIVETH
NOT
ME
BUT
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
AND
JOHN
ANSWERED
HIM
SAYING
MASTER

CASTING
OUT
DEVILS
IN

AND
HE
FOLLOWETH
NOT
US
AND
WE
FORBAD
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
FOLLOWETH
NOT

BUT
JESUS
SAID
FORBID
HIM
NOT
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
WHICH
SHALL
DO
A
MIRACLE
IN
MY
NAME
THAT
CAN
LIGHTLY
SPEAK
EVIL
OF

FOR
HE
THAT
IS
NOT

IS
ON
OUR
PART
FOR

SHALL
GIVE
YOU
A
CUP

CHRIST
VERILY
I

HIS
REWARD
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
OFFEND
ONE
OF
THESE
LITTLE
ONES
THAT
BELIEVE
IN

IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
HIM
THAT
A
MILLSTONE
WERE
HANGED
ABOUT
HIS
NECK
AND
HE
WERE
CAST
INTO
THE
SEA
AND
IF
THY
HAND
OFFEND
THEE
CUT
IT
OFF
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
THEE
TO
ENTER
INTO
LIFE
MAIMED
THAN
HAVING
TWO
HANDS
TO
GO
INTO
HELL
INTO
THE
FIRE
THAT
NEVER
SHALL
BE
QUENCHED
WHERE
THEIR
WORM
DIETH
NOT
AND
THE
FIRE
IS
NOT
QUENCHED
AND
IF
THY
FOOT
OFFEND
THEE
CUT
IT
OFF
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
THEE
TO
ENTER
HALT
INTO

THAN
HAVING
TWO
FEET
TO
BE
CAST
INTO
HELL
INTO
THE
FIRE
THAT
NEVER
SHALL
BE
QUENCHED
WHERE
THEIR
WORM
DIETH
NOT
AND
THE
FIRE
IS
NOT
QUENCHED
AND
IF
THINE
EYE
OFFEND
THEE
PLUCK
IT
OUT
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
THEE
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
WITH
ONE
EYE
THAN
HAVING
TWO
EYES
TO
BE
CAST
INTO
HELL
FIRE
WHERE
THEIR
WORM
DIETH
NOT
AND
THE

IS
NOT
QUENCHED
FOR
EVERY

SHALL
BE
SALTED
WITH

AND
EVERY

WITH
SALT
SALT
IS
GOOD
BUT
IF
THE
SALT
HAVE
LOST
HIS
SALTNESS
WHEREWITH
WILL
YE
SEASON
IT
HAVE
SALT
IN
YOURSELVES
AND
HAVE
PEACE
ONE
WITH
ANOTHER
AND
HE
AROSE
FROM
THENCE
AND
COMETH
INTO
THE
COASTS
OF
JUDAEA
BY
THE
FARTHER
SIDE
OF
JORDAN
AND
THE
PEOPLE
RESORT
UNTO
HIM
AGAIN
AND
AS
HE
WAS
WONT
HE
TAUGHT
THEM
AGAIN
AND
THE
PHARISEES
CAME
TO
HIM
AND
ASKED
HIM
IS
IT
LAWFUL
FOR
A
MAN
TO
PUT
AWAY
HIS
WIFE
TEMPTING
HIM
AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHAT
DID
MOSES
COMMAND
YOU
AND
THEY
SAID
MOSES
SUFFERED
TO
WRITE
A
BILL
OF
DIVORCEMENT
AND
TO
PUT
HER
AWAY
AND
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
FOR
THE
HARDNESS
OF
YOUR
HEART
HE
WROTE
YOU
THIS
PRECEPT
BUT
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
CREATION
GOD
MADE
THEM
MALE
AND
FEMALE
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
SHALL
A
MAN
LEAVE
HIS
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
AND
CLEAVE
TO
HIS
WIFE
AND
THEY
TWAIN
SHALL
BE
ONE
FLESH
SO
THEN
THEY
ARE
NO
MORE
TWAIN
BUT
ONE
FLESH
WHAT
THEREFORE
GOD
HATH
JOINED
TOGETHER
LET
NOT
MAN
PUT
ASUNDER
AND
IN
THE
HOUSE
HIS
DISCIPLES
ASKED
HIM
AGAIN
OF
THE
SAME
MATTER
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
PUT
AWAY
HIS
WIFE
AND
MARRY
ANOTHER
COMMITTETH
ADULTERY
AGAINST
HER
AND
IF
A
WOMAN
SHALL
PUT
AWAY
HER
HUSBAND
AND
BE
MARRIED
TO
ANOTHER
SHE
COMMITTETH
ADULTERY
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
YOUNG
CHILDREN
TO
HIM
THAT
HE
SHOULD
TOUCH
THEM
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
REBUKED
THOSE
THAT
BROUGHT
THEM
BUT
WHEN
JESUS
SAW
IT
HE
WAS
MUCH
DISPLEASED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
SUFFER
THE
LITTLE
CHILDREN
TO
COME
UNTO
ME
AND
FORBID
THEM
NOT
FOR
OF
SUCH
IS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
NOT
RECEIVE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AS
A
LITTLE
CHILD
HE
SHALL
NOT
ENTER
THEREIN
AND
HE
TOOK
THEM
UP
IN
HIS
ARMS
PUT
HIS
HANDS
UPON
THEM
AND
BLESSED
THEM
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
GONE
FORTH
INTO
THE
WAY
THERE
CAME
ONE
RUNNING
AND
KNEELED
TO
HIM
AND
ASKED
HIM
GOOD
MASTER
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
THAT
I
MAY
INHERIT
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHY
CALLEST
THOU
ME
GOOD
THERE
IS
NONE
GOOD
BUT
ONE
THAT
IS
GOD
THOU
KNOWEST
THE
COMMANDMENTS
DO
NOT
COMMIT
ADULTERY
DO
NOT
KILL
DO
NOT
STEAL
DO
NOT
BEAR
FALSE
WITNESS
DEFRAUD
NOT
HONOUR
THY
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
MASTER
ALL
THESE
HAVE
I
OBSERVED
FROM
MY
YOUTH
THEN
JESUS
BEHOLDING
HIM
LOVED
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ONE
THING
THOU
LACKEST
GO
THY
WAY
SELL
WHATSOEVER
THOU
HAST
AND
GIVE
TO
THE
POOR
AND
THOU
SHALT
HAVE
TREASURE
IN
HEAVEN
AND
COME
TAKE
UP
THE
CROSS
AND
FOLLOW
ME
AND
HE
WAS
SAD
AT
THAT
SAYING
AND
WENT
AWAY
GRIEVED
FOR
HE
HAD
GREAT
POSSESSIONS
AND
JESUS
LOOKED
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
SAITH
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
HOW
HARDLY
SHALL
THEY
THAT
HAVE
RICHES
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
WERE
ASTONISHED
AT
HIS
WORDS
BUT
JESUS
ANSWERETH
AGAIN
AND
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
CHILDREN
HOW
HARD
IS
IT
FOR
THEM
THAT
TRUST
IN
RICHES
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
IT
IS
EASIER
FOR
A
CAMEL
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
EYE
OF
A
NEEDLE
THAN
FOR
A
RICH
MAN
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
THEY
WERE
ASTONISHED
OUT
OF
MEASURE
SAYING
AMONG
THEMSELVES
WHO
THEN
CAN
BE
SAVED
AND
JESUS
LOOKING
UPON
THEM
SAITH
WITH
MEN
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
NOT
WITH
GOD
FOR
WITH
GOD
ALL
THINGS
ARE
POSSIBLE
THEN
PETER
BEGAN
TO
SAY
UNTO
HIM
LO
WE
HAVE
LEFT
ALL
AND
HAVE
FOLLOWED
THEE
AND
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THERE

NO
MAN
THAT

OR
SISTERS
OR
FATHER
OR

AND
MOTHERS
AND
CHILDREN
AND
LANDS
WITH

AND
IN
THE
WORLD
TO

ETERNAL
LIFE
BUT
MANY
THAT

FIRST
SHALL
BE
LAST
AND
THE
LAST
FIRST
AND
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
WAY
GOING
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
JESUS
WENT
BEFORE
THEM
AND
THEY
WERE
AMAZED
AND
AS
THEY
FOLLOWED
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
AND
HE
TOOK
AGAIN
THE

AND
BEGAN
TO
TELL
THEM
WHAT
THINGS

HAPPEN
UNTO
HIM
SAYING

TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THE
SON
OF

AND
UNTO
THE
SCRIBES
AND
THEY
SHALL
CONDEMN
HIM
TO
DEATH
AND
SHALL
DELIVER
HIM
TO
THE
GENTILES
AND
THEY
SHALL
MOCK
HIM
AND
SHALL
SCOURGE
HIM
AND

SPIT
UPON

AND
SHALL
KILL
HIM
AND
THE

ASKED
HIM
WHICH

THE

AND
TO
LOVE
HIS

IS
MORE
THAN
ALL
WHOLE
BURNT
OFFERINGS

AND
WHEN
JESUS
SAW
THAT

ANSWERED
DISCREETLY
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
ART
NOT
FAR
FROM
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
NO
MAN
AFTER
THAT
DURST
ASK
HIM
ANY
QUESTION
AND
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
WHILE
HE
TAUGHT
IN
THE
TEMPLE
HOW

THE
SCRIBES
THAT

AND
THE
COMMON
PEOPLE
HEARD
HIM
GLADLY
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IN
HIS
DOCTRINE
BEWARE
OF
THE
SCRIBES
WHICH

CLOTHING
AND
LOVE
SALUTATIONS
IN

SEATS
IN
THE

ROOMS
AT
FEASTS
WHICH
DEVOUR
WIDOWS'
HOUSES
AND
FOR
A
PRETENCE
MAKE
LONG
PRAYERS
THESE

RECEIVE
GREATER
DAMNATION
AND
JESUS
SAT
OVER
AGAINST

TREASURY
AND
BEHELD
HOW
THE
PEOPLE
CAST
MONEY
INTO
THE
TREASURY
AND
MANY
THAT
WERE

THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
CAME
AND
WENT
IN
BOLDLY
UNTO
PILATE
AND
CRAVED
THE
BODY
OF
JESUS
AND
PILATE
MARVELLED
IF
HE
WERE
ALREADY
DEAD
AND
CALLING
UNTO
HIM
THE
CENTURION
HE
ASKED
HIM
WHETHER
HE
HAD
BEEN
ANY
WHILE
DEAD
AND
WHEN
HE
KNEW
IT
OF
THE
CENTURION
HE
GAVE
THE
BODY
TO
JOSEPH
AND
HE
BOUGHT
FINE
LINEN
AND
TOOK
HIM
DOWN
AND
WRAPPED
HIM
IN
THE
LINEN
AND
LAID
HIM
IN
A
SEPULCHRE
WHICH
WAS
HEWN
OUT
OF
A
ROCK
AND
ROLLED
A
STONE
UNTO
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
MARY
MAGDALENE
AND
MARY
THE
MOTHER
OF
JOSES
BEHELD
WHERE
HE
WAS
LAID
AND
WHEN
THE
SABBATH
WAS
PAST
MARY
MAGDALENE
AND
MARY
THE
MOTHER
OF
JAMES
AND
SALOME
HAD
BOUGHT
SWEET
SPICES
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
COME
AND
ANOINT
HIM
AND
VERY
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
THEY
CAME
UNTO
THE
SEPULCHRE
AT
THE
RISING
OF
THE
SUN
AND
THEY
SAID
AMONG
THEMSELVES
WHO
SHALL
ROLL
US
AWAY
THE
STONE
FROM
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
WHEN
THEY
LOOKED
THEY
SAW
THAT
THE
STONE
WAS
ROLLED
AWAY
FOR
IT
WAS
VERY
GREAT
AND
ENTERING
INTO
THE
SEPULCHRE
THEY
SAW
A
YOUNG
MAN
SITTING
ON
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
CLOTHED
IN
A
LONG
WHITE
GARMENT
AND
THEY
WERE
AFFRIGHTED
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
BE
NOT
AFFRIGHTED
YE
SEEK
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
WHICH
WAS
CRUCIFIED
HE
IS
RISEN
HE
IS
NOT
HERE
BEHOLD
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
LAID
HIM
BUT
GO
YOUR
WAY
TELL
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
PETER
THAT
HE
GOETH
BEFORE
YOU
INTO
GALILEE
THERE
SHALL
YE
SEE
HIM
AS
HE
SAID
UNTO
YOU
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
QUICKLY
AND
FLED
FROM
THE
SEPULCHRE
FOR
THEY
TREMBLED
AND
WERE
AMAZED
NEITHER
SAID
THEY
ANY
THING
TO
ANY
MAN
FOR
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
NOW
WHEN
JESUS
WAS
RISEN
EARLY
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
HE
APPEARED
FIRST
TO
MARY
MAGDALENE
OUT
OF
WHOM
HE
HAD
CAST
SEVEN
DEVILS
AND
SHE
WENT
AND
TOLD
THEM
THAT
HAD
BEEN
WITH
HIM
AS
THEY
MOURNED
AND
WEPT
AND
THEY
WHEN
THEY
HAD
HEARD
THAT
HE
WAS
ALIVE
AND
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
OF
HER
BELIEVED
NOT
AFTER
THAT
HE
APPEARED
IN
ANOTHER
FORM
UNTO
TWO
OF
THEM
AS
THEY
WALKED
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
COUNTRY
AND
THEY
WENT
AND
TOLD
IT
UNTO
THE
RESIDUE
NEITHER
BELIEVED
THEY
THEM
AFTERWARD
HE
APPEARED
UNTO
THE
ELEVEN
AS
THEY
SAT
AT
MEAT
AND
UPBRAIDED
THEM
WITH
THEIR
UNBELIEF
AND
HARDNESS
OF
HEART
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVED
NOT
THEM
WHICH
HAD
SEEN
HIM
AFTER
HE
WAS
RISEN
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GO
YE
INTO
ALL
THE
WORLD
AND
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
TO
EVERY
CREATURE
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
AND
IS
BAPTIZED
SHALL
BE
SAVED
BUT
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
SHALL
BE
DAMNED
AND
THESE
SIGNS
SHALL
FOLLOW
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
IN
MY
NAME
SHALL
THEY
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
THEY
SHALL
SPEAK
WITH
NEW
TONGUES
THEY
SHALL
TAKE
UP
SERPENTS
AND
IF
THEY
DRINK
ANY
DEADLY
THING
IT
SHALL
NOT
HURT
THEM
THEY
SHALL
LAY
HANDS
ON
THE
SICK
AND
THEY
SHALL
RECOVER
SO
THEN
AFTER
THE
LORD
HAD
SPOKEN
UNTO
THEM
HE
WAS
RECEIVED
UP
INTO
HEAVEN
AND
SAT
ON
THE
RIGHT
HAND
OF
GOD
AND
THEY
WENT
FORTH
AND
PREACHED
EVERY
WHERE
THE
LORD
WORKING
WITH
THEM
AND
CONFIRMING
THE
WORD
WITH
SIGNS
FOLLOWING
AMEN
FORASMUCH
AS
MANY
HAVE
TAKEN
IN
HAND
TO
SET
FORTH
IN

A
DECLARATION
OF
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
MOST
SURELY
BELIEVED
AMONG
US
EVEN
AS
THEY
DELIVERED
THEM
UNTO
US
WHICH
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
WERE
EYEWITNESSES
AND
MINISTERS
OF
THE

IT
SEEMED
GOOD
TO
ME
ALSO

MOST
EXCELLENT

THAT
THOU

AND
HIS

AND
THEY
WERE
BOTH
RIGHTEOUS
BEFORE
GOD
WALKING
IN
ALL
THE
COMMANDMENTS
AND
ORDINANCES
OF
THE
LORD
BLAMELESS
AND
THEY
HAD
NO
CHILD
BECAUSE
THAT
ELISABETH
WAS
BARREN
AND
THEY
BOTH
WERE
NOW
WELL
STRICKEN
IN
YEARS
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHILE
HE
EXECUTED
THE
PRIEST'S
OFFICE
BEFORE
GOD
IN
THE
ORDER
OF
HIS
COURSE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
CUSTOM
OF
THE
PRIEST'S
OFFICE
HIS
LOT
WAS
TO
BURN
INCENSE
WHEN
HE
WENT
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
THE
WHOLE
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
PRAYING
WITHOUT

THE
TIME
OF

AND
THERE
APPEARED
UNTO
HIM
AN
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
STANDING
ON
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
OF
THE
ALTAR
OF
INCENSE
AND
WHEN
ZACHARIAS
SAW
HIM
HE
WAS
TROUBLED
AND
FEAR
FELL
UPON
HIM
BUT
THE
ANGEL
SAID
UNTO
HIM
FEAR

BIRTH
FOR
HE
SHALL
BE
GREAT
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
AND
SHALL
DRINK
NEITHER
WINE
NOR
STRONG
DRINK
AND
HE
SHALL
BE
FILLED
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
EVEN
FROM
HIS
MOTHER'S
WOMB
AND
MANY
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
SHALL
HE

TO
THE
LORD
THEIR

GO
BEFORE
HIM
IN
THE

OF
DEATH
TO
GUIDE
OUR

INTO
THE
WAY
OF
PEACE
AND
THE
CHILD
GREW
AND
WAXED
STRONG
IN
SPIRIT
AND
WAS
IN
THE
DESERTS
TILL
THE
DAY
OF
HIS
SHEWING
UNTO
ISRAEL
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THOSE
DAYS
THAT
THERE
WENT
OUT
A
DECREE
FROM
CAESAR
AUGUSTUS
THAT
ALL
THE
WORLD
SHOULD
BE
TAXED
AND
THIS
TAXING
WAS
FIRST
MADE
WHEN
CYRENIUS
WAS
GOVERNOR
OF
SYRIA
AND
ALL
WENT
TO
BE
TAXED
EVERY
ONE
INTO
HIS
OWN
CITY
AND
JOSEPH
ALSO
WENT
UP
FROM
GALILEE
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
OF
NAZARETH
INTO
JUDAEA
UNTO
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
WHICH
IS
CALLED
BETHLEHEM
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
OF
THE
HOUSE
AND
LINEAGE
OF
DAVID
TO
BE
TAXED
WITH
MARY
HIS
ESPOUSED
WIFE
BEING
GREAT
WITH
CHILD
AND
SO
IT
WAS
THAT
WHILE
THEY
WERE
THERE
THE
DAYS
WERE
ACCOMPLISHED
THAT
SHE
SHOULD
BE
DELIVERED
AND
SHE
BROUGHT
FORTH
HER
FIRSTBORN
SON
AND
WRAPPED
HIM
IN
SWADDLING
CLOTHES
AND
LAID
HIM
IN
A
MANGER
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NO
ROOM
FOR
THEM
IN
THE
INN
AND
THERE
WERE
IN
THE
SAME
COUNTRY
SHEPHERDS
ABIDING
IN
THE
FIELD
KEEPING
WATCH
OVER
THEIR
FLOCK
BY
NIGHT
AND
LO
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
CAME
UPON
THEM
AND
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
LORD
SHONE
ROUND
ABOUT
THEM
AND
THEY
WERE
SORE
AFRAID
AND
THE
ANGEL
SAID
UNTO
THEM
FEAR
NOT
FOR
BEHOLD
I
BRING
YOU
GOOD
TIDINGS
OF
GREAT
JOY
WHICH
SHALL
BE
TO
ALL
PEOPLE
FOR
UNTO
YOU
IS
BORN
THIS
DAY
IN
THE
CITY
OF
DAVID
A
SAVIOUR
WHICH
IS
CHRIST
THE
LORD
AND
THIS
SHALL
BE
A
SIGN
UNTO
YOU
YE
SHALL
FIND
THE
BABE
WRAPPED
IN
SWADDLING
CLOTHES
LYING
IN
A
MANGER
AND
SUDDENLY
THERE
WAS
WITH
THE
ANGEL
A
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
HEAVENLY
HOST
PRAISING
GOD
AND
SAYING
GLORY
TO
GOD
IN
THE
HIGHEST
AND
ON
EARTH
PEACE
GOOD
WILL
TOWARD
MEN
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
THE
ANGELS
WERE
GONE
AWAY
FROM
THEM
INTO
HEAVEN
THE
SHEPHERDS
SAID
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
LET
US
NOW
GO
EVEN
UNTO
BETHLEHEM
AND
SEE
THIS
THING
WHICH
IS
COME
TO
PASS
WHICH
THE
LORD
HATH
MADE
KNOWN
UNTO
US
AND
THEY
CAME
WITH
HASTE
AND
FOUND
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
AND
THE
BABE
LYING
IN
A
MANGER
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SEEN
IT
THEY
MADE
KNOWN

THIS
PROVERB
PHYSICIAN
HEAL
THYSELF
WHATSOEVER
WE
HAVE
HEARD
DONE
IN

DO
ALSO
HERE
IN
THY
COUNTRY
AND
HE
SAID
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
NO
PROPHET
IS
ACCEPTED
IN
HIS
OWN
COUNTRY
BUT
I
TELL
YOU
OF
A
TRUTH
MANY
WIDOWS
WERE
IN
ISRAEL
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
ELIAS
WHEN
THE
HEAVEN
WAS
SHUT
UP
THREE
YEARS
AND
SIX
MONTHS
WHEN
GREAT
FAMINE
WAS
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
LAND
BUT
UNTO
NONE
OF
THEM
WAS
ELIAS
SENT
SAVE
UNTO
SAREPTA
A
CITY
OF
SIDON
UNTO
A
WOMAN
THAT
WAS
A
WIDOW
AND
MANY
LEPERS
WERE
IN
ISRAEL
IN
THE
TIME
OF
ELISEUS
THE
PROPHET
AND
NONE
OF
THEM
WAS
CLEANSED
SAVING
NAAMAN
THE
SYRIAN
AND
ALL
THEY
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
WERE
FILLED
WITH
WRATH
AND
ROSE
UP
AND
THRUST
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AND
LED
HIM
UNTO
THE
BROW
OF
THE
HILL
WHEREON
THEIR
CITY
WAS
BUILT
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
CAST
HIM
DOWN
HEADLONG
BUT
HE
PASSING
THROUGH
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
WENT
HIS
WAY
AND
CAME
DOWN
TO
CAPERNAUM
A
CITY
OF
GALILEE
AND
TAUGHT
THEM
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAYS
AND
THEY
WERE
ASTONISHED
AT
HIS
DOCTRINE
FOR
HIS
WORD
WAS
WITH
POWER
AND
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
WHICH
HAD
A
SPIRIT
OF
AN
UNCLEAN
DEVIL
AND
CRIED
OUT
WITH
A
LOUD

FIELDS
AND
HIS

TAUGHT
AND
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
WHOSE
RIGHT
HAND
WAS
WITHERED
AND
THE
SCRIBES
AND
PHARISEES
WATCHED
HIM
WHETHER
HE
WOULD
HEAL
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
FIND
AN
ACCUSATION
AGAINST
HIM
BUT
HE
KNEW
THEIR
THOUGHTS

HAD
THE
WITHERED
HAND
RISE
UP
AND
STAND
FORTH
IN
THE
MIDST
AND

WITH
HIS

AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
LET
US
GO
OVER
UNTO
THE

AND
THEY
CEASED
AND
THERE
WAS
A
CALM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHERE

AND
THEY
BEING
AFRAID
WONDERED
SAYING
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
WHAT
MANNER
OF
MAN
IS
THIS
FOR
HE
COMMANDETH
EVEN
THE
WINDS
AND
WATER
AND
THEY
OBEY
HIM
AND
THEY
ARRIVED
AT
THE
COUNTRY
OF
THE

AND
HE
BRAKE
THE

AND
WAS
DRIVEN
OF
THE
DEVIL
INTO
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
JESUS
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
WHAT
IS
THY
NAME
AND
HE
SAID
LEGION
BECAUSE
MANY
DEVILS
WERE
ENTERED
INTO
HIM
AND
THEY
BESOUGHT
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
COMMAND
THEM
TO
GO
OUT
INTO

THERE
AN

OF
MANY
SWINE
FEEDING
ON
THE
MOUNTAIN
AND
THEY
BESOUGHT
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
SUFFER
THEM
TO

AND
HE
SUFFERED
THEM
THEN
WENT
THE
DEVILS
OUT
OF

OUT
TO
SEE
WHAT

DONE
AND
CAME
TO
JESUS
AND
FOUND
THE
MAN
OUT
OF
WHOM
THE
DEVILS

THEN
THE

MULTITUDE
OF
THE

AND
WHEN
THE

SHE
CAME
TREMBLING
AND
FALLING
DOWN
BEFORE
HIM
SHE
DECLARED
UNTO
HIM
BEFORE
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
WHAT
CAUSE
SHE
HAD
TOUCHED
HIM
AND
HOW

WAS
HEALED
IMMEDIATELY
AND

MEAT
AND
HER
PARENTS
WERE
ASTONISHED
BUT
HE
CHARGED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
TELL

THEN
HE
CALLED
HIS
TWELVE
DISCIPLES
TOGETHER
AND
GAVE
THEM
POWER
AND
AUTHORITY
OVER
ALL
DEVILS
AND
TO
CURE
DISEASES
AND
HE
SENT
THEM
TO
PREACH
THE
KINGDOM
OF

WHEN
YE
GO
OUT
OF
THAT
CITY
SHAKE
OFF
THE
VERY
DUST
FROM
YOUR
FEET
FOR
A
TESTIMONY
AGAINST
THEM
AND
THEY
DEPARTED
AND
WENT
THROUGH
THE
TOWNS
PREACHING
THE
GOSPEL
AND
HEALING
EVERY
WHERE
NOW
HEROD
THE
TETRARCH
HEARD
OF
ALL
THAT
WAS
DONE
BY
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
PERPLEXED
BECAUSE
THAT
IT
WAS
SAID
OF
SOME
THAT
JOHN
WAS
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
OF
SOME
THAT
ELIAS
HAD
APPEARED
AND
OF
OTHERS
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
OLD
PROPHETS
WAS
RISEN
AGAIN
AND
HEROD
SAID
JOHN
HAVE
I
BEHEADED
BUT
WHO
IS
THIS
OF
WHOM
I
HEAR
SUCH
THINGS
AND
HE
DESIRED
TO
SEE
HIM
AND
THE
APOSTLES
WHEN
THEY
WERE
RETURNED
TOLD
HIM
ALL
THAT
THEY
HAD
DONE
AND
HE
TOOK
THEM
AND
WENT
ASIDE
PRIVATELY
INTO
A
DESERT
PLACE
BELONGING
TO
THE
CITY
CALLED
BETHSAIDA
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
KNEW
IT
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
HE
RECEIVED
THEM
AND
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
OF
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
HEALED
THEM
THAT
HAD
NEED
OF
HEALING
AND
WHEN
THE
DAY
BEGAN
TO
WEAR
AWAY
THEN
CAME
THE
TWELVE
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
SEND
THE
MULTITUDE
AWAY
THAT
THEY
MAY
GO
INTO
THE
TOWNS
AND
COUNTRY
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
LODGE
AND
GET
VICTUALS
FOR
WE
ARE
HERE
IN
A
DESERT
PLACE
BUT
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GIVE
YE
THEM
TO
EAT
AND
THEY
SAID
WE
HAVE
NO
MORE
BUT
FIVE
LOAVES
AND
TWO
FISHES
EXCEPT
WE
SHOULD
GO
AND
BUY
MEAT
FOR
ALL
THIS
PEOPLE
FOR
THEY
WERE
ABOUT
FIVE
THOUSAND
MEN
AND
HE
SAID
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
MAKE
THEM
SIT
DOWN
BY
FIFTIES
IN
A
COMPANY
AND
THEY
DID
SO
AND
MADE
THEM
ALL
SIT
DOWN
THEN
HE
TOOK
THE
FIVE
LOAVES
AND
THE
TWO
FISHES
AND
LOOKING
UP
TO
HEAVEN
HE
BLESSED
THEM
AND
BRAKE
AND
GAVE
TO
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
SET
BEFORE
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
THEY
DID
EAT
AND
WERE
ALL
FILLED
AND
THERE
WAS
TAKEN
UP
OF
FRAGMENTS
THAT
REMAINED
TO
THEM
TWELVE
BASKETS
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
WAS
ALONE
PRAYING
HIS
DISCIPLES
WERE
WITH
HIM
AND
HE
ASKED
THEM
SAYING
WHOM
SAY
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
I
AM
THEY
ANSWERING
SAID
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
BUT
SOME
SAY
ELIAS
AND
OTHERS
SAY
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
OLD
PROPHETS
IS
RISEN
AGAIN
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
BUT
WHOM
SAY
YE
THAT
I
AM
PETER
ANSWERING
SAID
THE
CHRIST
OF
GOD
AND
HE
STRAITLY
CHARGED
THEM
AND
COMMANDED
THEM
TO
TELL
NO
MAN
THAT
THING
SAYING
THE
SON
OF
MAN
MUST
SUFFER
MANY
THINGS
AND
BE
REJECTED
OF
THE
ELDERS
AND
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
SCRIBES
AND
BE
SLAIN
AND
BE
RAISED
THE
THIRD
DAY
AND
HE
SAID
TO
THEM
ALL
IF
ANY
MAN
WILL
COME
AFTER
ME
LET
HIM
DENY
HIMSELF
AND
TAKE
UP
HIS
CROSS
DAILY
AND
FOLLOW
ME
FOR
WHOSOEVER
WILL
SAVE
HIS
LIFE
SHALL
LOSE
IT
BUT
WHOSOEVER
WILL
LOSE
HIS
LIFE
FOR
MY
SAKE
THE
SAME
SHALL
SAVE
IT
FOR
WHAT
IS
A
MAN
ADVANTAGED
IF
HE
GAIN
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
AND
LOSE
HIMSELF
OR
BE
CAST
AWAY
FOR
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
BE
ASHAMED
OF
ME
AND
OF
MY
WORDS
OF
HIM
SHALL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
ASHAMED
WHEN
HE
SHALL
COME
IN
HIS
OWN
GLORY
AND
IN
HIS
FATHER'S
AND
OF
THE
HOLY
ANGELS
BUT
I
TELL
YOU
OF
A
TRUTH
THERE
BE
SOME
STANDING
HERE
WHICH
SHALL
NOT
TASTE
OF
DEATH
TILL
THEY
SEE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
ABOUT
AN
EIGHT
DAYS
AFTER
THESE
SAYINGS
HE
TOOK
PETER
AND
JOHN
AND
JAMES
AND
WENT
UP
INTO
A
MOUNTAIN
TO
PRAY
AND
AS
HE
PRAYED
THE
FASHION
OF
HIS
COUNTENANCE
WAS
ALTERED
AND
HIS
RAIMENT
WAS
WHITE
AND
GLISTERING
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
TALKED
WITH
HIM
TWO
MEN
WHICH
WERE
MOSES
AND
ELIAS
WHO
APPEARED
IN
GLORY
AND
SPAKE
OF
HIS
DECEASE
WHICH
HE
SHOULD
ACCOMPLISH
AT
JERUSALEM
BUT
PETER
AND
THEY
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
WERE
HEAVY
WITH
SLEEP
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
AWAKE
THEY
SAW
HIS
GLORY
AND
THE
TWO
MEN
THAT
STOOD
WITH
HIM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
THEY
DEPARTED
FROM
HIM
PETER
SAID
UNTO
JESUS
MASTER
IT
IS
GOOD
FOR
US
TO
BE
HERE
AND
LET
US
MAKE
THREE
TABERNACLES
ONE
FOR
THEE
AND
ONE
FOR
MOSES
AND
ONE
FOR
ELIAS
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
HE
SAID
WHILE
HE
THUS
SPAKE
THERE
CAME
A
CLOUD
AND
OVERSHADOWED
THEM
AND
THEY
FEARED
AS
THEY
ENTERED
INTO
THE
CLOUD
AND
THERE
CAME
A
VOICE
OUT
OF
THE
CLOUD
SAYING
THIS
IS
MY
BELOVED
SON
HEAR
HIM
AND
WHEN
THE
VOICE
WAS
PAST
JESUS
WAS
FOUND
ALONE
AND
THEY
KEPT
IT
CLOSE
AND
TOLD
NO
MAN
IN
THOSE
DAYS
ANY
OF
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
THEY
HAD
SEEN
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
ON
THE
NEXT
DAY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
DOWN
FROM
THE
HILL
MUCH
PEOPLE
MET
HIM
AND
BEHOLD
A
MAN
OF
THE
COMPANY
CRIED
OUT
SAYING
MASTER
I
BESEECH
THEE
LOOK
UPON
MY
SON
FOR
HE
IS
MINE
ONLY
CHILD
AND
LO
A
SPIRIT
TAKETH
HIM
AND
HE
SUDDENLY
CRIETH
OUT
AND
IT
TEARETH
HIM
THAT
HE
FOAMETH
AGAIN
AND
BRUISING
HIM
HARDLY
DEPARTETH
FROM
HIM
AND
I
BESOUGHT
THY
DISCIPLES
TO
CAST
HIM
OUT
AND
THEY
COULD
NOT
AND
JESUS
ANSWERING
SAID
O
FAITHLESS
AND
PERVERSE
GENERATION
HOW
LONG
SHALL
I
BE
WITH
YOU
AND
SUFFER
YOU
BRING
THY
SON
HITHER
AND
AS
HE
WAS
YET
A
COMING
THE
DEVIL
THREW
HIM
DOWN
AND
TARE
HIM
AND
JESUS
REBUKED
THE
UNCLEAN
SPIRIT
AND
HEALED
THE
CHILD
AND
DELIVERED
HIM
AGAIN
TO
HIS
FATHER
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
AMAZED
AT
THE
MIGHTY
POWER
OF
GOD
BUT
WHILE
THEY
WONDERED
EVERY
ONE
AT
ALL
THINGS
WHICH
JESUS
DID
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
LET
THESE
SAYINGS
SINK
DOWN
INTO
YOUR
EARS
FOR
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
BE
DELIVERED
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
MEN
BUT
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
NOT
THIS
SAYING
AND
IT
WAS
HID
FROM
THEM
THAT
THEY
PERCEIVED
IT
NOT
AND
THEY
FEARED
TO
ASK
HIM
OF
THAT
SAYING
THEN
THERE
AROSE
A
REASONING
AMONG
THEM
WHICH
OF
THEM
SHOULD
BE
GREATEST
AND
JESUS
PERCEIVING
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THEIR
HEART
TOOK
A
CHILD
AND
SET
HIM
BY
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
RECEIVE
THIS
CHILD
IN
MY
NAME
RECEIVETH
ME
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
RECEIVE
ME
RECEIVETH
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
LEAST
AMONG
YOU
ALL
THE
SAME
SHALL
BE
GREAT
AND
JOHN
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
MASTER
WE
SAW
ONE
CASTING
OUT
DEVILS
IN
THY
NAME
AND
WE
FORBAD
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
FOLLOWETH
NOT
WITH
US
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
FORBID
HIM
NOT
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
NOT
AGAINST
US
IS
FOR
US
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
TIME
WAS
COME
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
RECEIVED
UP
HE
STEDFASTLY
SET
HIS
FACE
TO
GO
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
SENT
MESSENGERS
BEFORE
HIS
FACE
AND
THEY
WENT
AND
ENTERED
INTO
A
VILLAGE
OF
THE
SAMARITANS
TO
MAKE
READY
FOR
HIM
AND
THEY
DID
NOT
RECEIVE
HIM
BECAUSE
HIS
FACE
WAS
AS
THOUGH
HE
WOULD
GO
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
WHEN
HIS
DISCIPLES
JAMES
AND
JOHN
SAW
THIS
THEY
SAID
LORD
WILT

A
CERTAIN
MAN
SAID
UNTO

THEE
I

UNTO
YOU
THOUGH
HE
WILL
NOT

BECAUSE
HE
IS
HIS

YET
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
IMPORTUNITY
HE
WILL
RISE
AND
GIVE
HIM
AS
MANY
AS

NEEDETH
AND
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU

IF
A
SON
SHALL
ASK
BREAD
OF
ANY

YOU
THAT
IS
A

WILL
HE
GIVE
HIM
A
STONE
OR
IF

FOR
A
FISH
GIVE
HIM
A
SERPENT
OR
IF
HE
SHALL
ASK
AN
EGG
WILL
HE
OFFER
HIM
A
SCORPION
IF
YE
THEN
BEING
EVIL
KNOW
HOW
TO
GIVE
GOOD
GIFTS
UNTO
YOUR
CHILDREN
HOW
MUCH
MORE
SHALL
YOUR
HEAVENLY
FATHER
GIVE
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
TO
THEM
THAT
ASK
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
CASTING
OUT
A
DEVIL
AND
IT
WAS
DUMB
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHEN
THE
DEVIL
WAS
GONE
OUT
THE
DUMB
SPAKE
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WONDERED
BUT
SOME
OF
THEM
SAID
HE
CASTETH
OUT
DEVILS
THROUGH
BEELZEBUB
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
DEVILS
AND
OTHERS
TEMPTING
HIM
SOUGHT
OF
HIM
A
SIGN
FROM
HEAVEN
BUT
HE
KNOWING
THEIR
THOUGHTS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
EVERY
KINGDOM
DIVIDED
AGAINST
ITSELF
IS
BROUGHT
TO
DESOLATION
AND
A
HOUSE
DIVIDED
AGAINST
A
HOUSE
FALLETH
IF
SATAN
ALSO
BE
DIVIDED
AGAINST
HIMSELF
HOW
SHALL
HIS
KINGDOM
STAND
BECAUSE
YE
SAY
THAT
I
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
THROUGH
BEELZEBUB
AND
IF
I
BY
BEELZEBUB
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
BY
WHOM
DO
YOUR
SONS
CAST
THEM
OUT
THEREFORE
SHALL
THEY
BE
YOUR
JUDGES
BUT
IF
I
WITH
THE
FINGER
OF
GOD
CAST
OUT
DEVILS
NO
DOUBT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
IS
COME
UPON
YOU
WHEN
A
STRONG
MAN
ARMED
KEEPETH
HIS
PALACE
HIS
GOODS
ARE
IN
PEACE
BUT
WHEN
A
STRONGER
THAN
HE
SHALL
COME
UPON
HIM
AND
OVERCOME
HIM
HE
TAKETH
FROM
HIM
ALL
HIS
ARMOUR
WHEREIN
HE
TRUSTED
AND
DIVIDETH
HIS
SPOILS
HE
THAT
IS
NOT
WITH
ME
IS
AGAINST
ME
AND
HE
THAT
GATHERETH
NOT
WITH
ME
SCATTERETH
WHEN
THE
UNCLEAN
SPIRIT
IS
GONE
OUT
OF
A
MAN
HE
WALKETH
THROUGH
DRY
PLACES
SEEKING
REST
AND
FINDING
NONE
HE
SAITH
I
WILL
RETURN
UNTO
MY
HOUSE
WHENCE
I
CAME
OUT
AND
WHEN
HE
COMETH
HE
FINDETH
IT
SWEPT
AND
GARNISHED
THEN
GOETH
HE
AND
TAKETH
TO
HIM
SEVEN
OTHER
SPIRITS
MORE
WICKED
THAN
HIMSELF
AND
THEY
ENTER
IN
AND
DWELL
THERE
AND
THE
LAST
STATE
OF
THAT
MAN
IS
WORSE
THAN
THE
FIRST
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
SPAKE
THESE
THINGS
A
CERTAIN
WOMAN
OF
THE
COMPANY
LIFTED
UP
HER
VOICE
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
BLESSED

THE
WOMB
THAT
BARE
THEE

HAST
SUCKED
BUT
HE
SAID
YEA
RATHER
BLESSED
ARE
THEY
THAT
HEAR
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
KEEP
IT
AND
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
GATHERED
THICK
TOGETHER
HE
BEGAN
TO
SAY
THIS
IS
AN
EVIL
GENERATION
THEY
SEEK
A
SIGN
AND
THERE
SHALL
NO
SIGN
BE
GIVEN
IT
BUT
THE
SIGN
OF
JONAS
THE
PROPHET
FOR

REPENTED
AT
THE
PREACHING
OF
JONAS
AND
BEHOLD
A
GREATER
THAN

NO

WHEN
HE
HATH
LIGHTED
A
CANDLE
PUTTETH
IT
IN
A
SECRET
PLACE
NEITHER
UNDER

ON
A
CANDLESTICK
THAT
THEY
WHICH

SPAKE
A
CERTAIN
PHARISEE
BESOUGHT
HIM
TO
DINE
WITH

AND
HE
WENT
IN

SAT
DOWN
TO
MEAT
AND
WHEN
THE
PHARISEE

IT
HE
MARVELLED
THAT

HAD
NOT

AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO

PHARISEES
MAKE

APOSTLES
AND
SOME
OF
THEM
THEY
SHALL
SLAY
AND
PERSECUTE
THAT
THE
BLOOD
OF
ALL
THE
PROPHETS
WHICH
WAS
SHED
FROM

LAYING
WAIT

SEEKING
TO
CATCH
SOMETHING
OUT

WHEN
THERE
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER

AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
SPEAK
A

OF
COVETOUSNESS
FOR
A
MAN'S
LIFE
CONSISTETH
NOT
IN
THE
ABUNDANCE
OF
THE
THINGS
WHICH

POSSESSETH
AND
HE
SPAKE
A
PARABLE
UNTO
THEM
SAYING
THE
GROUND
OF
A
CERTAIN
RICH
MAN
BROUGHT
FORTH
PLENTIFULLY
AND
HE
THOUGHT
WITHIN
HIMSELF
SAYING
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
NO
ROOM
WHERE
TO
BESTOW
MY
FRUITS
AND
HE
SAID
THIS
WILL
I
DO
I
WILL
PULL
DOWN
MY

AND
BUILD
GREATER
AND
THERE
WILL
I
BESTOW
ALL

THAT
LAYETH
UP
TREASURE
FOR

FOR
YOUR
LIFE
WHAT
YE
SHALL
EAT
NEITHER
FOR
THE
BODY
WHAT
YE
SHALL
PUT
ON
THE

IS
MORE
THAN
MEAT
AND
THE

IS
MORE

RAIMENT
CONSIDER
THE
RAVENS
FOR
THEY
NEITHER
SOW
NOR
REAP
WHICH
NEITHER
HAVE
STOREHOUSE
NOR

AND
GOD
FEEDETH
THEM
HOW

CAN
ADD

ONE
CUBIT
IF

THEN
BE
NOT
ABLE
TO

CONSIDER
THE
LILIES
HOW

GROW
THEY
TOIL
NOT
THEY
SPIN
NOT
AND
YET
I

UNTO
YOU
THAT
SOLOMON
IN
ALL
HIS
GLORY
WAS

TO
MORROW
IS
CAST
INTO
THE

HOW
MUCH
MORE
WILL
HE
CLOTHE
YOU
O
YE
OF
LITTLE
FAITH
AND
SEEK
NOT

WHAT
YE
SHALL
EAT
OR

DOUBTFUL
MIND
FOR
ALL
THESE
THINGS

THE
KINGDOM
OF

AND
ALL
THESE
THINGS

FEAR
NOT

YOUR
TREASURE
IS
THERE
WILL
YOUR
HEART
BE
ALSO
LET
YOUR
LOINS
BE
GIRDED
ABOUT

BURNING

YOURSELVES
LIKE
UNTO

THOSE
SERVANTS
WHOM
THE

THAT
HE
SHALL
GIRD
HIMSELF
AND
MAKE
THEM
TO
SIT
DOWN
TO
MEAT

AND
IF
HE
SHALL
COME
IN
THE
SECOND
WATCH
OR
COME
IN
THE
THIRD
WATCH
AND
FIND
THEM
SO
BLESSED
ARE
THOSE
SERVANTS
AND
THIS
KNOW
THAT
IF
THE
GOODMAN
OF
THE
HOUSE
HAD
KNOWN
WHAT
HOUR
THE
THIEF
WOULD
COME
HE
WOULD
HAVE
WATCHED
AND
NOT
HAVE
SUFFERED
HIS
HOUSE
TO
BE
BROKEN
THROUGH
BE
YE
THEREFORE
READY
ALSO
FOR
THE
SON
OF
MAN
COMETH
AT
AN
HOUR
WHEN
YE
THINK
NOT
THEN
PETER
SAID
UNTO
HIM
LORD
SPEAKEST
THOU
THIS
PARABLE
UNTO
US
OR
EVEN
TO
ALL
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
WHO
THEN
IS
THAT
FAITHFUL
AND
WISE
STEWARD
WHOM
HIS
LORD
SHALL
MAKE
RULER
OVER
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
TO
GIVE
THEM
THEIR
PORTION
OF
MEAT
IN
DUE
SEASON
BLESSED
IS
THAT
SERVANT
WHOM
HIS

FIND
SO
DOING
OF
A
TRUTH
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
HE
WILL
MAKE
HIM
RULER
OVER
ALL
THAT

DELAYETH
HIS
COMING
AND

BEGIN
TO
BEAT
THE
MENSERVANTS

MAIDENS
AND
TO
EAT

TO
BE
DRUNKEN
THE
LORD
OF

WILL
CUT
HIM
IN
SUNDER
AND
WILL
APPOINT
HIM
HIS

WITH
THE
UNBELIEVERS
AND
THAT
SERVANT
WHICH
KNEW
HIS
LORD'S
WILL
AND
PREPARED
NOT
HIMSELF
NEITHER
DID
ACCORDING
TO
HIS

SHALL
BE
BEATEN
WITH
MANY

THINGS
WORTHY
OF

SHALL
BE
BEATEN
WITH
FEW
STRIPES
FOR
UNTO
WHOMSOEVER
MUCH
IS

OF

ME
A

BE
GLAD
FOR
THIS
THY

WAS
DEAD
AND
IS
ALIVE
AGAIN
AND
WAS
LOST
AND

AND
HE
SAID
ALSO
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
RICH
MAN
WHICH
HAD
A
STEWARD
AND
THE
SAME
WAS
ACCUSED
UNTO
HIM
THAT
HE
HAD
WASTED
HIS
GOODS
AND
HE
CALLED
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
I
HEAR
THIS
OF
THEE
GIVE
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
THY
STEWARDSHIP
FOR
THOU
MAYEST
BE
NO

STEWARD
THEN
THE
STEWARD
SAID
WITHIN
HIMSELF
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
FOR
MY
LORD
TAKETH
AWAY
FROM

THE
STEWARDSHIP
I
CANNOT
DIG
TO
BEG

RESOLVED
WHAT
TO
DO
THAT
WHEN
I
AM
PUT
OUT
OF
THE
STEWARDSHIP
THEY
MAY
RECEIVE
ME
INTO
THEIR
HOUSES
SO
HE
CALLED
EVERY
ONE
OF
HIS
LORD'S
DEBTORS
UNTO
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
FIRST
HOW
MUCH
OWEST
THOU
UNTO
MY

OF
OIL

UNTO
HIM
TAKE

SIT
DOWN
QUICKLY
AND
WRITE

MAMMON
OF
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
THAT
WHEN

IS
FAITHFUL
ALSO
IN

HE
THAT
IS
UNJUST
IN
THE
LEAST
IS
UNJUST
ALSO
IN
MUCH
IF
THEREFORE
YE
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
FAITHFUL
IN
THE
UNRIGHTEOUS
MAMMON
WHO
WILL
COMMIT
TO
YOUR

IN
THAT
WHICH
IS
ANOTHER
MAN'S
WHO
SHALL
GIVE
YOU
THAT
WHICH
IS
YOUR
OWN
NO
SERVANT
CAN
SERVE
TWO
MASTERS
FOR
EITHER
HE
WILL
HATE
THE
ONE
AND
LOVE
THE
OTHER
OR
ELSE
HE
WILL
HOLD
TO
THE
ONE
AND
DESPISE
THE
OTHER
YE
CANNOT
SERVE
GOD
AND
MAMMON
AND
THE
PHARISEES
ALSO
WHO
WERE
COVETOUS
HEARD
ALL
THESE
THINGS
AND
THEY
DERIDED
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
ARE
THEY
WHICH
JUSTIFY
YOURSELVES
BEFORE
MEN
BUT
GOD
KNOWETH
YOUR
HEARTS
FOR
THAT
WHICH
IS
HIGHLY
ESTEEMED
AMONG
MEN
IS
ABOMINATION
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD

THE
PROPHETS
WERE
UNTIL
JOHN
SINCE
THAT
TIME
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
IS
PREACHED
AND
EVERY
MAN
PRESSETH
INTO
IT
AND
IT
IS
EASIER
FOR
HEAVEN
AND

TO
PASS
THAN
ONE
TITTLE
OF
THE

WHOSOEVER
PUTTETH

ANOTHER
COMMITTETH
ADULTERY

BETTER
FOR

THAT
A
MILLSTONE
WERE
HANGED
ABOUT

SAY
UNTO
THIS
SYCAMINE
TREE
BE

ROOT
AND
BE
THOU
PLANTED
IN

DOTH
HE

BECAUSE
HE
DID
THE
THINGS
THAT
WERE
COMMANDED
HIM
I
TROW
NOT
SO
LIKEWISE
YE
WHEN
YE
SHALL
HAVE
DONE
ALL
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
COMMANDED
YOU
SAY
WE
ARE
UNPROFITABLE
SERVANTS
WE
HAVE
DONE
THAT
WHICH
WAS
OUR
DUTY
TO
DO
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
WENT
TO
JERUSALEM
THAT
HE
PASSED
THROUGH
THE
MIDST
OF
SAMARIA
AND
GALILEE
AND
AS
HE
ENTERED
INTO
A
CERTAIN
VILLAGE
THERE
MET
HIM
TEN
MEN
THAT
WERE
LEPERS
WHICH
STOOD
AFAR
OFF
AND
THEY
LIFTED
UP
THEIR
VOICES
AND
SAID
JESUS
MASTER
HAVE
MERCY
ON
US
AND
WHEN
HE
SAW
THEM
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
GO
SHEW
YOURSELVES
UNTO
THE
PRIESTS
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
AS
THEY
WENT
THEY
WERE
CLEANSED
AND
ONE
OF
THEM
WHEN
HE
SAW
THAT
HE
WAS
HEALED
TURNED
BACK
AND
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
GLORIFIED
GOD
AND
FELL
DOWN
ON
HIS
FACE
AT
HIS
FEET
GIVING
HIM
THANKS
AND
HE
WAS
A
SAMARITAN
AND
JESUS
ANSWERING
SAID
WERE
THERE
NOT
TEN
CLEANSED
BUT
WHERE
ARE
THE
NINE
THERE
ARE
NOT
FOUND
THAT
RETURNED
TO
GIVE
GLORY
TO
GOD
SAVE
THIS
STRANGER
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ARISE
GO
THY
WAY
THY
FAITH
HATH
MADE
THEE
WHOLE
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
DEMANDED
OF
THE
PHARISEES
WHEN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
SHOULD
COME
HE
ANSWERED
THEM
AND
SAID
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
COMETH
NOT
WITH
OBSERVATION
NEITHER
SHALL
THEY
SAY
LO
HERE
OR
LO
THERE
FOR
BEHOLD
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
IS
WITHIN
YOU
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THE
DISCIPLES
THE
DAYS
WILL
COME
WHEN
YE
SHALL
DESIRE
TO
SEE
ONE
OF
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
SON
OF
MAN
AND
YE
SHALL
NOT
SEE
IT
AND
THEY
SHALL
SAY
TO
YOU
SEE
HERE
OR
SEE
THERE
GO
NOT
AFTER
THEM
NOR
FOLLOW
THEM
FOR
AS
THE
LIGHTNING
THAT
LIGHTENETH
OUT
OF
THE
ONE
PART
UNDER
HEAVEN
SHINETH
UNTO
THE
OTHER
PART
UNDER
HEAVEN
SO
SHALL
ALSO
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
IN
HIS
DAY
BUT
FIRST
MUST
HE
SUFFER
MANY
THINGS
AND
BE
REJECTED
OF
THIS
GENERATION
AND
AS
IT
WAS
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
NOE
SO
SHALL
IT
BE
ALSO
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
SON
OF
MAN
THEY
DID
EAT
THEY
DRANK
THEY
MARRIED
WIVES
THEY
WERE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
UNTIL
THE
DAY
THAT
NOE
ENTERED
INTO
THE
ARK
AND
THE
FLOOD
CAME
AND
DESTROYED
THEM
ALL
LIKEWISE
ALSO
AS
IT
WAS
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
LOT
THEY
DID
EAT
THEY
DRANK
THEY
BOUGHT
THEY
SOLD
THEY
PLANTED
THEY
BUILDED
BUT
THE
SAME
DAY
THAT
LOT
WENT
OUT
OF
SODOM
IT
RAINED
FIRE
AND
BRIMSTONE
FROM
HEAVEN
AND
DESTROYED
THEM
ALL
EVEN
THUS
SHALL
IT
BE
IN
THE
DAY
WHEN
THE
SON
OF
MAN
IS
REVEALED
IN
THAT
DAY
HE
WHICH
SHALL
BE
UPON
THE
HOUSETOP
AND
HIS
STUFF
IN
THE
HOUSE
LET
HIM
NOT
COME
DOWN
TO
TAKE
IT
AWAY
AND
HE
THAT
IS
IN
THE
FIELD
LET
HIM
LIKEWISE
NOT
RETURN
BACK
REMEMBER
LOT'S
WIFE
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
SEEK
TO
SAVE
HIS
LIFE
SHALL
LOSE
IT
AND
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
LOSE
HIS
LIFE
SHALL
PRESERVE
IT
I
TELL
YOU
IN
THAT
NIGHT
THERE
SHALL
BE
TWO
MEN
IN
ONE
BED
THE
ONE
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
AND
THE
OTHER
SHALL
BE
LEFT
TWO
WOMEN
SHALL
BE
GRINDING
TOGETHER
THE
ONE
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
AND
THE
OTHER
LEFT
TWO
MEN
SHALL
BE
IN
THE
FIELD
THE
ONE
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
AND
THE
OTHER
LEFT
AND
THEY
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHERE
LORD
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHERESOEVER
THE
BODY
IS
THITHER
WILL
THE
EAGLES
BE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
AND
HE
SPAKE
A
PARABLE
UNTO
THEM
TO
THIS
END
THAT
MEN
OUGHT
ALWAYS
TO
PRAY
AND
NOT
TO
FAINT
SAYING
THERE
WAS
IN
A
CITY
A
JUDGE
WHICH
FEARED
NOT
GOD
NEITHER
REGARDED
MAN
AND
THERE
WAS
A
WIDOW
IN
THAT
CITY
AND
SHE
CAME
UNTO
HIM
SAYING
AVENGE
ME
OF
MINE
ADVERSARY
AND
HE
WOULD
NOT
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
AFTERWARD
HE
SAID
WITHIN
HIMSELF
THOUGH
I
FEAR
NOT
GOD
NOR
REGARD
MAN
YET
BECAUSE
THIS
WIDOW
TROUBLETH
ME
I
WILL
AVENGE
HER
LEST
BY
HER
CONTINUAL
COMING
SHE
WEARY
ME
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
HEAR
WHAT
THE
UNJUST
JUDGE
SAITH
AND
SHALL
NOT
GOD
AVENGE
HIS

ELECT
WHICH
CRY
DAY
AND
NIGHT
UNTO
HIM
THOUGH
HE
BEAR
LONG
WITH
THEM
I
TELL
YOU
THAT
HE
WILL
AVENGE
THEM
SPEEDILY
NEVERTHELESS
WHEN
THE
SON
OF
MAN
COMETH
SHALL
HE
FIND
FAITH
ON
THE
EARTH
AND
HE
SPAKE
THIS
PARABLE
UNTO
CERTAIN
WHICH
TRUSTED
IN
THEMSELVES
THAT
THEY
WERE
RIGHTEOUS
AND
DESPISED
OTHERS
TWO
MEN
WENT
UP
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
TO
PRAY
THE
ONE
A
PHARISEE
AND
THE
OTHER
A
PUBLICAN
THE
PHARISEE
STOOD
AND
PRAYED
THUS
WITH
HIMSELF
GOD
I
THANK
THEE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AS
OTHER
MEN
ARE
EXTORTIONERS
UNJUST
ADULTERERS
OR
EVEN
AS
THIS
PUBLICAN
I
FAST
TWICE
IN
THE
WEEK
I
GIVE
TITHES
OF
ALL
THAT
I
POSSESS
AND
THE
PUBLICAN
STANDING
AFAR
OFF
WOULD
NOT
LIFT
UP
SO
MUCH
AS
HIS
EYES
UNTO
HEAVEN
BUT
SMOTE
UPON
HIS
BREAST
SAYING
GOD
BE
MERCIFUL
TO
ME
A
SINNER
I
TELL
YOU
THIS
MAN
WENT
DOWN
TO
HIS
HOUSE
JUSTIFIED
RATHER
THAN
THE
OTHER
FOR
EVERY
ONE
THAT
EXALTETH
HIMSELF
SHALL
BE
ABASED
AND
HE
THAT
HUMBLETH
HIMSELF
SHALL
BE
EXALTED
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
UNTO
HIM
ALSO
INFANTS
THAT
HE
WOULD
TOUCH
THEM
BUT
WHEN
HIS
DISCIPLES
SAW
IT
THEY
REBUKED
THEM
BUT
JESUS
CALLED
THEM
UNTO
HIM
AND
SAID
SUFFER
LITTLE
CHILDREN
TO
COME
UNTO
ME
AND
FORBID
THEM
NOT
FOR
OF
SUCH
IS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
NOT
RECEIVE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AS
A
LITTLE
CHILD
SHALL
IN
NO
WISE
ENTER
THEREIN
AND
A
CERTAIN
RULER
ASKED
HIM
SAYING
GOOD
MASTER
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
TO
INHERIT
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHY
CALLEST
THOU
ME
GOOD
NONE
IS
GOOD
SAVE
ONE
THAT
IS
GOD
THOU
KNOWEST
THE
COMMANDMENTS
DO
NOT
COMMIT
ADULTERY
DO
NOT
KILL
DO
NOT
STEAL
DO
NOT
BEAR
FALSE
WITNESS
HONOUR
THY
FATHER
AND
THY
MOTHER
AND
HE
SAID
ALL
THESE
HAVE
I
KEPT
FROM
MY
YOUTH
UP
NOW
WHEN
JESUS
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
YET
LACKEST
THOU
ONE
THING
SELL
ALL
THAT
THOU
HAST
AND
DISTRIBUTE
UNTO
THE
POOR
AND
THOU
SHALT
HAVE
TREASURE
IN
HEAVEN
AND
COME
FOLLOW
ME
AND
WHEN
HE
HEARD
THIS
HE
WAS
VERY
SORROWFUL
FOR
HE
WAS
VERY
RICH
AND
WHEN
JESUS
SAW
THAT
HE
WAS
VERY
SORROWFUL
HE
SAID
HOW
HARDLY
SHALL
THEY
THAT
HAVE
RICHES
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
FOR
IT
IS
EASIER
FOR
A
CAMEL
TO
GO
THROUGH
A
NEEDLE'S
EYE
THAN
FOR
A
RICH
MAN
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
THEY
THAT
HEARD
IT
SAID
WHO
THEN
CAN
BE
SAVED
AND
HE
SAID
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
IMPOSSIBLE
WITH
MEN
ARE
POSSIBLE
WITH
GOD
THEN
PETER
SAID
LO
WE
HAVE
LEFT
ALL
AND
FOLLOWED
THEE
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
THAT
HATH
LEFT
HOUSE
OR
PARENTS
OR
BRETHREN
OR
WIFE
OR
CHILDREN
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD'S
SAKE
WHO
SHALL
NOT
RECEIVE
MANIFOLD
MORE
IN
THIS
PRESENT
TIME
AND
IN
THE
WORLD
TO
COME
LIFE
EVERLASTING
THEN
HE
TOOK
UNTO
HIM
THE
TWELVE
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
BEHOLD
WE
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
ALL
THINGS
THAT
ARE
WRITTEN
BY
THE
PROPHETS
CONCERNING
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
FOR
HE
SHALL
BE
DELIVERED
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
SHALL
BE
MOCKED
AND
SPITEFULLY
ENTREATED
AND
SPITTED
ON
AND
THEY
SHALL
SCOURGE
HIM
AND
PUT
HIM
TO
DEATH
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
SHALL
RISE
AGAIN
AND
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
NONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
AND
THIS
SAYING
WAS
HID
FROM
THEM
NEITHER
KNEW
THEY
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
AS
HE
WAS
COME
NIGH
UNTO
JERICHO
A
CERTAIN
BLIND
MAN
SAT
BY
THE
WAY
SIDE
BEGGING
AND
HEARING
THE
MULTITUDE
PASS
BY
HE
ASKED
WHAT
IT
MEANT
AND
THEY
TOLD
HIM
THAT
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
PASSETH
BY
AND
HE
CRIED
SAYING
JESUS
THOU
SON
OF
DAVID
HAVE
MERCY
ON
ME
AND
THEY
WHICH
WENT
BEFORE
REBUKED
HIM
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HOLD
HIS
PEACE
BUT
HE
CRIED
SO

THY
SIGHT
THY
FAITH
HATH
SAVED
THEE
AND
IMMEDIATELY
HE

AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
SAW
IT
GAVE
PRAISE
UNTO
GOD
AND
JESUS
ENTERED
AND
PASSED
THROUGH
JERICHO
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
NAMED
ZACCHAEUS
WHICH
WAS
THE
CHIEF
AMONG
THE
PUBLICANS
AND
HE
WAS
RICH
AND
HE
SOUGHT
TO
SEE
JESUS
WHO
HE
WAS
AND
COULD
NOT
FOR
THE
PRESS
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
LITTLE
OF
STATURE
AND
HE
RAN
BEFORE
AND
CLIMBED
UP
INTO
A
SYCOMORE
TREE
TO
SEE
HIM
FOR

IT
THEY
ALL
MURMURED
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
GONE
TO
BE
GUEST
WITH
A
MAN
THAT
IS
A
SINNER
AND
ZACCHAEUS
STOOD
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
LORD
BEHOLD
LORD
THE
HALF
OF
MY
GOODS
I
GIVE
TO
THE
POOR
AND
IF
I
HAVE
TAKEN
ANY
THING
FROM
ANY
MAN
BY
FALSE
ACCUSATION
I
RESTORE
HIM
FOURFOLD
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THIS
DAY
IS
SALVATION
COME
TO
THIS
HOUSE
FORSOMUCH
AS
HE
ALSO
IS
A
SON
OF
ABRAHAM
FOR

SEEK
AND
TO
SAVE
THAT

WAS
LOST
AND
AS

BECAUSE
HE
WAS
NIGH

AND
BECAUSE

SHOULD
IMMEDIATELY
APPEAR
HE

THEREFORE
A
CERTAIN
NOBLEMAN
WENT
INTO
A

COUNTRY
TO
RECEIVE
FOR
HIMSELF
A
KINGDOM
AND
TO
RETURN
AND
HE
CALLED
HIS
TEN
SERVANTS
AND
DELIVERED
THEM
TEN
POUNDS
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
OCCUPY
TILL
I
COME
BUT
HIS
CITIZENS
HATED
HIM
AND
SENT
A
MESSAGE
AFTER
HIM
SAYING
WE
WILL
NOT
HAVE
THIS
MAN
TO
REIGN
OVER
US
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
HE
WAS
RETURNED
HAVING
RECEIVED
THE
KINGDOM
THEN
HE
COMMANDED
THESE
SERVANTS
TO
BE
CALLED
UNTO
HIM
TO
WHOM
HE
HAD
GIVEN
THE
MONEY
THAT
HE
MIGHT
KNOW
HOW

BELONGED
UNTO
HEROD'S
JURISDICTION
HE
SENT
HIM
TO
HEROD
WHO
HIMSELF
ALSO
WAS
AT
JERUSALEM
AT
THAT
TIME
AND
WHEN
HEROD
SAW
JESUS
HE
WAS
EXCEEDING
GLAD
FOR
HE
WAS
DESIROUS
TO
SEE
HIM
OF
A
LONG
SEASON
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
HEARD
MANY
THINGS
OF
HIM
AND
HE
HOPED
TO
HAVE
SEEN
SOME
MIRACLE
DONE
BY
HIM
THEN
HE
QUESTIONED
WITH

BUT
HE
ANSWERED
HIM
NOTHING
AND
THE

STOOD
AND
VEHEMENTLY
ACCUSED
HIM
AND
HEROD
WITH
HIS

OF
WAR
SET

IN
A
GORGEOUS
ROBE
AND

DAY
PILATE
AND
HEROD
WERE
MADE
FRIENDS
TOGETHER
FOR
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
AT
ENMITY
BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
AND
PILATE
WHEN
HE
HAD
CALLED
TOGETHER
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
THE
RULERS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
HAVE
BROUGHT
THIS
MAN
UNTO
ME
AS
ONE
THAT
PERVERTETH
THE
PEOPLE
AND
BEHOLD
I
HAVING
EXAMINED
HIM
BEFORE
YOU
HAVE
FOUND
NO
FAULT
IN
THIS
MAN
TOUCHING
THOSE
THINGS
WHEREOF
YE
ACCUSE
HIM
NO
NOR

HEROD
FOR
I
SENT
YOU
TO
HIM
AND
LO
NOTHING
WORTHY
OF
DEATH
IS
DONE
UNTO
HIM
I
WILL
THEREFORE
CHASTISE
HIM
AND
RELEASE
HIM
FOR
OF
NECESSITY
HE
MUST
RELEASE
ONE
UNTO
THEM
AT
THE
FEAST
AND
THEY
CRIED
OUT
ALL
AT
ONCE
SAYING
AWAY
WITH
THIS
MAN
AND
RELEASE
UNTO
US
BARABBAS
WHO
FOR
A

CRIED
SAYING
CRUCIFY
HIM
CRUCIFY
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THE
THIRD
TIME
WHY
WHAT
EVIL
HATH
HE
DONE
I
HAVE
FOUND
NO
CAUSE
OF
DEATH
IN
HIM
I
WILL
THEREFORE
CHASTISE
HIM
AND
LET
HIM
GO
AND
THEY
WERE
INSTANT
WITH
LOUD
VOICES
REQUIRING
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
CRUCIFIED
AND
THE
VOICES
OF
THEM
AND
OF
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
PREVAILED
AND
PILATE
GAVE
SENTENCE
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
AS
THEY
REQUIRED
AND
HE
RELEASED
UNTO
THEM
HIM
THAT
FOR
SEDITION
AND
MURDER
WAS
CAST
INTO
PRISON
WHOM
THEY
HAD
DESIRED
BUT
HE
DELIVERED
JESUS
TO
THEIR
WILL
AND
AS
THEY
LED
HIM
AWAY
THEY
LAID
HOLD
UPON
ONE
SIMON
A
CYRENIAN
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
AND
ON
HIM
THEY
LAID
THE
CROSS
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BEAR
IT
AFTER
JESUS
AND
THERE
FOLLOWED
HIM
A
GREAT
COMPANY
OF
PEOPLE
AND
OF
WOMEN
WHICH
ALSO
BEWAILED
AND
LAMENTED
HIM
BUT
JESUS
TURNING
UNTO
THEM
SAID
DAUGHTERS
OF
JERUSALEM
WEEP
NOT
FOR
ME
BUT
WEEP
FOR
YOURSELVES
AND
FOR
YOUR
CHILDREN
FOR
BEHOLD
THE
DAYS
ARE
COMING
IN
THE
WHICH
THEY
SHALL
SAY
BLESSED
ARE
THE
BARREN
AND
THE
WOMBS
THAT
NEVER
BARE
AND
THE
PAPS
WHICH
NEVER
GAVE
SUCK
THEN
SHALL
THEY
BEGIN
TO
SAY
TO
THE
MOUNTAINS
FALL
ON
US
AND
TO
THE
HILLS
COVER
US
FOR
IF
THEY
DO
THESE
THINGS
IN
A
GREEN
TREE
WHAT
SHALL
BE
DONE
IN
THE
DRY
AND
THERE
WERE
ALSO
TWO
OTHER
MALEFACTORS
LED
WITH
HIM
TO
BE
PUT
TO
DEATH
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
TO
THE
PLACE
WHICH
IS
CALLED
CALVARY
THERE
THEY
CRUCIFIED
HIM
AND
THE
MALEFACTORS
ONE
ON
THE
RIGHT
HAND
AND
THE
OTHER
ON
THE
LEFT
THEN
SAID
JESUS
FATHER
FORGIVE
THEM
FOR
THEY
KNOW
NOT
WHAT
THEY
DO
AND
THEY
PARTED
HIS
RAIMENT
AND
CAST
LOTS
AND
THE
PEOPLE
STOOD
BEHOLDING
AND
THE
RULERS
ALSO
WITH
THEM
DERIDED
HIM
SAYING
HE
SAVED
OTHERS
LET

TOGETHER
TO
THAT
SIGHT
BEHOLDING
THE
THINGS

WERE
DONE
SMOTE
THEIR
BREASTS
AND
RETURNED
AND
ALL
HIS
ACQUAINTANCE
AND
THE

STOOD
AFAR
OFF
BEHOLDING
THESE

WAS
A
MAN

IN
LINEN
AND
LAID

IN
A
SEPULCHRE
THAT
WAS
HEWN
IN

DAY
ACCORDING

THE
COMMANDMENT
NOW
UPON

FIRST
DAY
OF

WEEK
VERY
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
THEY
CAME
UNTO
THE
SEPULCHRE
BRINGING
THE
SPICES
WHICH
THEY
HAD
PREPARED
AND
CERTAIN
OTHERS
WITH

AND
THEY
FOUND
THE
STONE
ROLLED
AWAY
FROM
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
THEY
ENTERED
IN
AND
FOUND
NOT
THE
BODY
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
THEY
WERE
MUCH
PERPLEXED
THEREABOUT
BEHOLD
TWO
MEN
STOOD
BY
THEM
IN
SHINING
GARMENTS
AND
AS
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
AND
BOWED
DOWN
THEIR
FACES
TO
THE
EARTH
THEY
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
SEEK
YE
THE
LIVING
AMONG
THE
DEAD
HE
IS
NOT
HERE
BUT
IS
RISEN
REMEMBER
HOW
HE
SPAKE
UNTO
YOU
WHEN
HE
WAS
YET
IN
GALILEE
SAYING
THE
SON
OF
MAN
MUST
BE
DELIVERED
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
SINFUL
MEN
AND
BE
CRUCIFIED
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
RISE
AGAIN
AND
THEY
REMEMBERED
HIS
WORDS
AND
RETURNED
FROM
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
TOLD
ALL
THESE
THINGS
UNTO
THE
ELEVEN
AND
TO
ALL
THE
REST
IT
WAS
MARY
MAGDALENE
AND
JOANNA
AND
MARY
THE
MOTHER
OF
JAMES
AND
OTHER
WOMEN
THAT
WERE
WITH
THEM
WHICH
TOLD
THESE
THINGS
UNTO
THE
APOSTLES
AND
THEIR
WORDS
SEEMED
TO
THEM
AS
IDLE
TALES
AND
THEY
BELIEVED
THEM
NOT
THEN
AROSE
PETER
AND
RAN
UNTO
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
STOOPING
DOWN
HE
BEHELD
THE
LINEN
CLOTHES
LAID
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
DEPARTED
WONDERING
IN
HIMSELF
AT
THAT
WHICH
WAS
COME
TO
PASS
AND
BEHOLD
TWO
OF
THEM
WENT
THAT
SAME
DAY
TO
A
VILLAGE
CALLED
EMMAUS
WHICH
WAS
FROM
JERUSALEM
ABOUT
THREESCORE
FURLONGS
AND
THEY
TALKED
TOGETHER
OF
ALL
THESE
THINGS
WHICH
HAD
HAPPENED
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHILE
THEY
COMMUNED
TOGETHER
AND
REASONED
JESUS
HIMSELF
DREW
NEAR
AND
WENT
WITH
THEM
BUT
THEIR
EYES
WERE
HOLDEN
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
KNOW
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHAT
MANNER
OF
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE
THESE
THAT
YE
HAVE
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
AS
YE
WALK
AND
ARE
SAD
AND
THE
ONE
OF
THEM
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
CLEOPAS
ANSWERING
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ART
THOU
ONLY
A
STRANGER
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
HAST
NOT
KNOWN
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
COME
TO
PASS
THERE
IN
THESE
DAYS
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHAT
THINGS
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
CONCERNING
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
WHICH
WAS
A
PROPHET
MIGHTY
IN
DEED
AND
WORD
BEFORE
GOD
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
AND
HOW
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
OUR
RULERS
DELIVERED
HIM
TO
BE
CONDEMNED
TO
DEATH
AND
HAVE
CRUCIFIED
HIM
BUT
WE
TRUSTED
THAT
IT
HAD
BEEN
HE
WHICH
SHOULD
HAVE
REDEEMED
ISRAEL
AND
BESIDE
ALL
THIS
TO
DAY
IS
THE
THIRD
DAY
SINCE
THESE
THINGS
WERE
DONE
YEA
AND
CERTAIN
WOMEN
ALSO
OF
OUR
COMPANY
MADE
US
ASTONISHED
WHICH
WERE
EARLY
AT
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
WHEN
THEY
FOUND
NOT
HIS
BODY
THEY
CAME
SAYING
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALSO
SEEN
A
VISION
OF
ANGELS
WHICH
SAID
THAT
HE
WAS
ALIVE
AND
CERTAIN
OF
THEM
WHICH
WERE
WITH
US
WENT
TO
THE
SEPULCHRE
AND
FOUND
IT
EVEN
SO
AS
THE
WOMEN
HAD
SAID
BUT
HIM
THEY
SAW
NOT
THEN
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
O
FOOLS
AND
SLOW
OF
HEART
TO
BELIEVE
ALL
THAT
THE
PROPHETS
HAVE
SPOKEN
OUGHT
NOT
CHRIST
TO
HAVE
SUFFERED
THESE
THINGS
AND
TO
ENTER
INTO
HIS
GLORY
AND
BEGINNING
AT
MOSES
AND
ALL
THE
PROPHETS
HE
EXPOUNDED
UNTO
THEM
IN
ALL
THE
SCRIPTURES
THE
THINGS
CONCERNING
HIMSELF
AND
THEY
DREW
NIGH
UNTO
THE
VILLAGE
WHITHER
THEY
WENT
AND
HE
MADE
AS
THOUGH
HE
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
FURTHER
BUT
THEY
CONSTRAINED
HIM
SAYING
ABIDE
WITH
US
FOR
IT
IS
TOWARD
EVENING
AND
THE
DAY
IS
FAR
SPENT
AND
HE
WENT
IN
TO
TARRY
WITH
THEM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
HE
SAT
AT
MEAT
WITH
THEM
HE
TOOK
BREAD
AND
BLESSED
IT
AND
BRAKE
AND
GAVE
TO
THEM
AND
THEIR
EYES
WERE
OPENED
AND
THEY
KNEW
HIM
AND
HE
VANISHED
OUT
OF
THEIR
SIGHT
AND
THEY
SAID
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
DID
NOT
OUR
HEART
BURN
WITHIN
US
WHILE
HE
TALKED
WITH
US
BY
THE
WAY
AND
WHILE
HE
OPENED
TO
US
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
THEY
ROSE
UP
THE
SAME
HOUR
AND
RETURNED
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
FOUND
THE
ELEVEN
GATHERED
TOGETHER
AND
THEM
THAT
WERE
WITH
THEM
SAYING
THE
LORD
IS
RISEN
INDEED
AND
HATH
APPEARED
TO
SIMON
AND
THEY
TOLD
WHAT
THINGS
WERE
DONE
IN
THE
WAY
AND
HOW
HE
WAS
KNOWN
OF
THEM
IN
BREAKING
OF
BREAD
AND
AS
THEY
THUS
SPAKE
JESUS
HIMSELF
STOOD
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
AND
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
PEACE
BE
UNTO
YOU
BUT
THEY
WERE
TERRIFIED
AND
AFFRIGHTED
AND
SUPPOSED
THAT
THEY
HAD
SEEN
A
SPIRIT
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHY
ARE
YE
TROUBLED
AND
WHY
DO
THOUGHTS
ARISE
IN
YOUR
HEARTS
BEHOLD
MY
HANDS
AND
MY
FEET
THAT
IT
IS
I
MYSELF
HANDLE
ME
AND
SEE
FOR
A
SPIRIT
HATH
NOT
FLESH
AND
BONES
AS
YE
SEE
ME
HAVE
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
THUS
SPOKEN
HE
SHEWED
THEM
HIS
HANDS
AND
HIS
FEET
AND
WHILE
THEY
YET
BELIEVED
NOT
FOR
JOY
AND
WONDERED
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
HAVE
YE
HERE
ANY
MEAT
AND
THEY
GAVE
HIM
A
PIECE
OF
A
BROILED
FISH
AND
OF
AN
HONEYCOMB
AND
HE
TOOK
IT
AND
DID
EAT
BEFORE
THEM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THESE
ARE
THE
WORDS
WHICH
I
SPAKE
UNTO
YOU
WHILE
I
WAS
YET
WITH
YOU
THAT
ALL
THINGS
MUST
BE
FULFILLED
WHICH
WERE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
AND
IN
THE
PROPHETS
AND
IN
THE
PSALMS
CONCERNING
ME
THEN
OPENED
HE
THEIR
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
UNDERSTAND
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THUS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
AND
THUS
IT
BEHOVED
CHRIST
TO
SUFFER
AND
TO
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
THIRD
DAY
AND
THAT
REPENTANCE
AND
REMISSION
OF
SINS
SHOULD
BE
PREACHED
IN
HIS
NAME
AMONG
ALL
NATIONS
BEGINNING
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
YE
ARE
WITNESSES
OF
THESE
THINGS
AND
BEHOLD
I
SEND
THE
PROMISE
OF
MY
FATHER
UPON
YOU
BUT
TARRY
YE
IN
THE
CITY
OF
JERUSALEM
UNTIL

ENDUED
WITH
POWER
FROM
ON
HIGH
AND
HE
LED
THEM
OUT
AS
FAR
AS
TO
BETHANY
AND
HE
LIFTED
UP
HIS
HANDS
AND
BLESSED
THEM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
WHILE
HE
BLESSED
THEM
HE
WAS
PARTED
FROM
THEM
AND
CARRIED
UP
INTO
HEAVEN
AND
THEY
WORSHIPPED
HIM
AND
RETURNED
TO
JERUSALEM
WITH
GREAT
JOY
AND
WERE
CONTINUALLY
IN
THE
TEMPLE
PRAISING
AND
BLESSING
GOD
AMEN
IN
THE
BEGINNING
WAS
THE
WORD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
WITH
GOD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
GOD
THE
SAME
WAS
IN
THE
BEGINNING
WITH
GOD
ALL
THINGS
WERE
MADE
BY
HIM
AND
WITHOUT
HIM
WAS
NOT
ANY
THING
MADE
THAT
WAS
MADE
IN
HIM
WAS
LIFE
AND
THE
LIFE
WAS
THE
LIGHT
OF
MEN
AND
THE
LIGHT
SHINETH
IN
DARKNESS
AND
THE
DARKNESS
COMPREHENDED
IT
NOT
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
SENT
FROM
GOD
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
JOHN
THE
SAME

FOR
A
WITNESS
TO
BEAR
WITNESS
OF
THE
LIGHT
THAT
ALL
MEN
THROUGH
HIM
MIGHT
BELIEVE
HE
WAS
NOT
THAT
LIGHT
BUT
WAS
SENT
TO
BEAR
WITNESS
OF
THAT
LIGHT
THAT
WAS
THE
TRUE
LIGHT
WHICH
LIGHTETH
EVERY
MAN
THAT
COMETH
INTO
THE
WORLD
HE
WAS
IN
THE

WAS
MADE
BY

UNTO
HIS

AS
MANY
AS

HIM
TO
THEM
GAVE
HE
POWER
TO
BECOME
THE
SONS
OF
GOD
EVEN
TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
ON
HIS
NAME
WHICH
WERE
BORN
NOT
OF
BLOOD
NOR
OF
THE
WILL
OF
THE
FLESH
NOR
OF
THE
WILL
OF
MAN
BUT
OF
GOD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
MADE
FLESH
AND
DWELT
AMONG
US
AND
WE
BEHELD
HIS
GLORY
THE
GLORY
AS

AT
ANY
TIME
THE
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
SON
WHICH
IS
IN
THE
BOSOM
OF
THE
FATHER
HE
HATH
DECLARED
HIM
AND
THIS
IS
THE
RECORD
OF
JOHN
WHEN
THE
JEWS

PRIESTS
AND
LEVITES
FROM
JERUSALEM
TO
ASK
HIM
WHO

CALLED

AND
SAITH
UNTO

EVERY

AT
THE
BEGINNING
DOTH
SET
FORTH
GOOD
WINE
AND
WHEN
MEN
HAVE
WELL
DRUNK
THEN
THAT
WHICH
IS
WORSE
BUT
THOU
HAST
KEPT
THE
GOOD
WINE
UNTIL
NOW
THIS
BEGINNING
OF
MIRACLES
DID
JESUS
IN
CANA
OF
GALILEE
AND
MANIFESTED
FORTH
HIS
GLORY
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
BELIEVED
ON
HIM
AFTER
THIS
HE
WENT
DOWN
TO
CAPERNAUM
HE
AND
HIS
MOTHER
AND
HIS
BRETHREN
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THEY
CONTINUED
THERE
NOT
MANY
DAYS
AND
THE
JEWS'
PASSOVER
WAS
AT
HAND
AND
JESUS
WENT
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
FOUND
IN
THE
TEMPLE
THOSE
THAT
SOLD
OXEN
AND
SHEEP
AND
DOVES
AND
THE
CHANGERS
OF
MONEY
SITTING
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
MADE
A
SCOURGE
OF
SMALL
CORDS
HE
DROVE
THEM
ALL
OUT
OF
THE
TEMPLE
AND
THE
SHEEP
AND
THE
OXEN
AND
POURED
OUT
THE
CHANGERS'
MONEY
AND
OVERTHREW
THE
TABLES
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THAT
SOLD
DOVES
TAKE
THESE
THINGS
HENCE
MAKE
NOT
MY
FATHER'S
HOUSE
AN
HOUSE
OF
MERCHANDISE
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
REMEMBERED
THAT
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
THE
ZEAL
OF
THINE
HOUSE
HATH
EATEN
ME
UP
THEN
ANSWERED
THE
JEWS
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
SIGN
SHEWEST
THOU
UNTO
US
SEEING
THAT
THOU
DOEST
THESE
THINGS
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
DESTROY
THIS
TEMPLE
AND
IN
THREE
DAYS
I
WILL
RAISE
IT
UP
THEN
SAID
THE
JEWS
FORTY
AND
SIX
YEARS
WAS
THIS
TEMPLE
IN
BUILDING
AND
WILT
THOU
REAR
IT
UP
IN
THREE
DAYS
BUT
HE
SPAKE
OF
THE
TEMPLE
OF
HIS
BODY
WHEN
THEREFORE
HE
WAS
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
HIS
DISCIPLES
REMEMBERED
THAT
HE
HAD
SAID
THIS
UNTO
THEM
AND
THEY
BELIEVED
THE
SCRIPTURE
AND
THE
WORD
WHICH
JESUS
HAD
SAID
NOW
WHEN
HE
WAS
IN
JERUSALEM
AT
THE
PASSOVER
IN
THE
FEAST
DAY
MANY
BELIEVED
IN
HIS
NAME
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
MIRACLES
WHICH
HE
DID
BUT
JESUS
DID
NOT
COMMIT
HIMSELF
UNTO
THEM
BECAUSE
HE
KNEW
ALL
MEN
AND
NEEDED
NOT
THAT
ANY
SHOULD
TESTIFY
OF
MAN
FOR
HE
KNEW
WHAT
WAS
IN
MAN
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
OF
THE
PHARISEES
NAMED
NICODEMUS
A
RULER
OF
THE
JEWS
THE

CAME
TO
JESUS
BY

AND
SAID
UNTO

RABBI
WE

THESE
MIRACLES
THAT

JESUS
ANSWERED
AND

VERILY
VERILY
I

UNTO
THEE
EXCEPT
A
MAN

HE
CANNOT
SEE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
NICODEMUS
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
HOW
CAN
A
MAN
BE
BORN
WHEN
HE
IS
OLD
CAN
HE
ENTER
THE
SECOND
TIME
INTO
HIS
MOTHER'S
WOMB
AND
BE
BORN
JESUS
ANSWERED
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
THEE
EXCEPT
A
MAN
BE
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
OF
THE
SPIRIT
HE
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
THAT
WHICH
IS
BORN
OF
THE
FLESH
IS
FLESH
AND
THAT
WHICH
IS
BORN
OF
THE
SPIRIT
IS
SPIRIT
MARVEL
NOT
THAT
I
SAID
UNTO
THEE
YE
MUST
BE
BORN
AGAIN
THE
WIND
BLOWETH
WHERE
IT
LISTETH
AND
THOU
HEAREST
THE
SOUND
THEREOF
BUT
CANST
NOT
TELL
WHENCE
IT
COMETH
AND
WHITHER
IT
GOETH
SO
IS
EVERY
ONE
THAT
IS
BORN
OF
THE
SPIRIT
NICODEMUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
HOW
CAN
THESE
THINGS
BE
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ART
THOU
A
MASTER
OF
ISRAEL
AND
KNOWEST
NOT
THESE
THINGS
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
THEE
WE
SPEAK
THAT
WE
DO
KNOW
AND
TESTIFY
THAT
WE
HAVE
SEEN
AND
YE
RECEIVE
NOT
OUR
WITNESS
IF
I
HAVE
TOLD
YOU
EARTHLY
THINGS
AND
YE
BELIEVE
NOT
HOW
SHALL
YE
BELIEVE
IF
I
TELL
YOU
OF
HEAVENLY
THINGS
AND
NO
MAN
HATH
ASCENDED
UP
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
HE
THAT
CAME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
EVEN
THE
SON
OF
MAN
WHICH
IS
IN
HEAVEN
AND
AS
MOSES
LIFTED
UP
THE
SERPENT
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
EVEN
SO
MUST
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
LIFTED
UP
THAT
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
IN
HIM
SHOULD
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
FOR
GOD
SO
LOVED
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
GAVE
HIS
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
SON
THAT
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
IN
HIM
SHOULD
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
EVERLASTING
LIFE
FOR
GOD
SENT
NOT
HIS
SON
INTO
THE
WORLD
TO
CONDEMN
THE
WORLD
BUT
THAT
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
HIM
MIGHT
BE
SAVED
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON
HIM
IS
NOT
CONDEMNED
BUT
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
IS
CONDEMNED
ALREADY
BECAUSE
HE
HATH
NOT
BELIEVED
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
SON
OF
GOD
AND
THIS
IS
THE
CONDEMNATION
THAT
LIGHT
IS
COME
INTO
THE
WORLD
AND
MEN
LOVED
DARKNESS
RATHER
THAN
LIGHT
BECAUSE
THEIR
DEEDS
WERE
EVIL
FOR
EVERY
ONE
THAT
DOETH
EVIL
HATETH
THE
LIGHT
NEITHER
COMETH
TO
THE
LIGHT
LEST
HIS
DEEDS
SHOULD
BE
REPROVED
BUT
HE
THAT
DOETH
TRUTH
COMETH
TO
THE
LIGHT
THAT
HIS
DEEDS
MAY
BE
MADE
MANIFEST
THAT
THEY
ARE
WROUGHT
IN
GOD
AFTER
THESE
THINGS
CAME
JESUS
AND
HIS
DISCIPLES
INTO
THE
LAND
OF
JUDAEA
AND
THERE
HE
TARRIED
WITH
THEM
AND
BAPTIZED
AND
JOHN
ALSO
WAS
BAPTIZING
IN
AENON
NEAR
TO
SALIM
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
MUCH
WATER
THERE
AND
THEY
CAME
AND
WERE
BAPTIZED
FOR
JOHN
WAS
NOT
YET
CAST
INTO
PRISON
THEN
THERE
AROSE
A
QUESTION
BETWEEN
SOME
OF
JOHN'S
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
JEWS
ABOUT
PURIFYING
AND
THEY
CAME
UNTO
JOHN
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
RABBI
HE
THAT
WAS
WITH
THEE
BEYOND
JORDAN
TO
WHOM
THOU
BAREST
WITNESS
BEHOLD
THE
SAME
BAPTIZETH
AND
ALL
MEN
COME
TO
HIM
JOHN
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
A
MAN
CAN
RECEIVE
NOTHING
EXCEPT
IT
BE
GIVEN
HIM
FROM
HEAVEN
YE
YOURSELVES
BEAR
ME
WITNESS
THAT
I
SAID
I
AM
NOT
THE
CHRIST
BUT
THAT
I
AM
SENT
BEFORE
HIM
HE
THAT
HATH
THE
BRIDE
IS
THE
BRIDEGROOM
BUT
THE
FRIEND
OF
THE
BRIDEGROOM
WHICH
STANDETH
AND
HEARETH
HIM
REJOICETH
GREATLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BRIDEGROOM'S
VOICE
THIS
MY
JOY
THEREFORE
IS
FULFILLED
HE
MUST
INCREASE
BUT
I
MUST
DECREASE
HE
THAT
COMETH
FROM

ALL
AND
WHAT
HE
HATH
SEEN
AND
HEARD
THAT
HE
TESTIFIETH
AND
NO
MAN
RECEIVETH
HIS
TESTIMONY
HE
THAT
HATH
RECEIVED
HIS
TESTIMONY
HATH
SET
TO
HIS
SEAL
THAT
GOD
IS
TRUE
FOR
HE
WHOM
GOD
HATH
SENT
SPEAKETH
THE
WORDS
OF
GOD
FOR
GOD
GIVETH
NOT
THE
SPIRIT
BY
MEASURE
UNTO
HIM
THE
FATHER
LOVETH
THE
SON
AND
HATH
GIVEN
ALL
THINGS
INTO
HIS
HAND
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON
THE
SON
HATH
EVERLASTING
LIFE
AND
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
THE
SON
SHALL
NOT
SEE
LIFE
BUT
THE
WRATH
OF
GOD
ABIDETH
ON
HIM
WHEN
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
KNEW
HOW
THE
PHARISEES
HAD
HEARD
THAT
JESUS
MADE
AND
BAPTIZED
MORE
DISCIPLES
THAN
JOHN
THOUGH
JESUS

OTHER

AND
MANY
OF
THE
SAMARITANS
OF
THAT
CITY
BELIEVED
ON
HIM
FOR
THE
SAYING
OF
THE
WOMAN
WHICH
TESTIFIED
HE
TOLD
ME
ALL
THAT
EVER
I
DID
SO
WHEN
THE
SAMARITANS
WERE
COME
UNTO
HIM
THEY
BESOUGHT
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
TARRY
WITH
THEM
AND
HE
ABODE
THERE
TWO
DAYS
AND
MANY
MORE
BELIEVED
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
OWN
WORD
AND
SAID
UNTO
THE
WOMAN
NOW
WE
BELIEVE
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
THY
SAYING
FOR
WE
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
OURSELVES
AND
KNOW
THAT
THIS
IS
INDEED
THE
CHRIST
THE
SAVIOUR
OF
THE
WORLD
NOW
AFTER
TWO
DAYS
HE
DEPARTED
THENCE
AND
WENT
INTO
GALILEE
FOR
JESUS
HIMSELF
TESTIFIED
THAT
A
PROPHET
HATH
NO
HONOUR
IN
HIS

COUNTRY
THEN
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
INTO
GALILEE
THE
GALILAEANS
RECEIVED
HIM
HAVING
SEEN
ALL
THE
THINGS
THAT
HE
DID
AT
JERUSALEM
AT
THE
FEAST
FOR
THEY
ALSO
WENT
UNTO
THE
FEAST
SO
JESUS
CAME
AGAIN
INTO
CANA
OF
GALILEE
WHERE
HE
MADE
THE
WATER
WINE
AND
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
NOBLEMAN
WHOSE
SON
WAS
SICK
AT
CAPERNAUM
WHEN
HE
HEARD
THAT
JESUS
WAS
COME
OUT
OF
JUDAEA
INTO
GALILEE
HE
WENT
UNTO
HIM
AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
COME
DOWN
AND
HEAL
HIS
SON
FOR
HE
WAS
AT
THE
POINT
OF
DEATH
THEN
SAID
JESUS
UNTO
HIM
EXCEPT

SIGNS
AND
WONDERS
YE
WILL
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
NOBLEMAN
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
SIR

ERE
MY
CHILD
DIE
JESUS
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
GO
THY
WAY
THY
SON
LIVETH
AND
THE
MAN
BELIEVED
THE
WORD
THAT
JESUS
HAD
SPOKEN
UNTO
HIM
AND
HE
WENT
HIS
WAY
AND
AS
HE
WAS
NOW
GOING
DOWN
HIS
SERVANTS
MET
HIM
AND
TOLD
HIM
SAYING
THY
SON
LIVETH
THEN
ENQUIRED
HE
OF
THEM
THE
HOUR
WHEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
AMEND
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
YESTERDAY
AT
THE
SEVENTH
HOUR
THE
FEVER
LEFT
HIM
SO
THE
FATHER
KNEW
THAT
IT
WAS
AT
THE
SAME
HOUR
IN
THE
WHICH
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THY
SON
LIVETH
AND
HIMSELF
BELIEVED
AND
HIS
WHOLE
HOUSE
THIS

AND
THEREFORE
DID
THE
JEWS
PERSECUTE
JESUS
AND
SOUGHT
TO
SLAY
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
DONE
THESE
THINGS
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
BUT
JESUS
ANSWERED
THEM
MY
FATHER
WORKETH
HITHERTO
AND
I
WORK
THEREFORE
THE
JEWS
SOUGHT
THE
MORE

BUT
SAID
ALSO
THAT
GOD
WAS
HIS

MAKING
HIMSELF
EQUAL
WITH
GOD
THEN
ANSWERED

AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THE

BUT
WHAT

THESE
ALSO
DOETH
THE
SON
LIKEWISE
FOR
THE

LOVETH
THE

AND
SHEWETH
HIM
ALL
THINGS
THAT
HIMSELF
DOETH
AND
HE
WILL
SHEW
HIM
GREATER
WORKS
THAN
THESE
THAT
YE
MAY
MARVEL
FOR
AS
THE
FATHER
RAISETH
UP
THE
DEAD
AND
QUICKENETH
THEM
EVEN
SO
THE
SON
QUICKENETH
WHOM
HE
WILL
FOR
THE
FATHER
JUDGETH
NO
MAN
BUT
HATH
COMMITTED
ALL
JUDGMENT
UNTO
THE
SON
THAT
ALL
MEN
SHOULD
HONOUR
THE
SON
EVEN
AS
THEY
HONOUR
THE
FATHER
HE
THAT
HONOURETH
NOT
THE

HONOURETH
NOT
THE
FATHER
WHICH
HATH
SENT
HIM
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
HE
THAT
HEARETH
MY
WORD
AND
BELIEVETH
ON
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
HATH
EVERLASTING
LIFE
AND
SHALL
NOT
COME
INTO
CONDEMNATION
BUT
IS
PASSED
FROM
DEATH
UNTO
LIFE
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THE
HOUR
IS
COMING
AND
NOW
IS
WHEN
THE
DEAD
SHALL
HEAR
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
THEY
THAT
HEAR
SHALL
LIVE
FOR
AS
THE
FATHER
HATH
LIFE
IN

SO
HATH
HE
GIVEN
TO
THE
SON
TO
HAVE
LIFE
IN
HIMSELF
AND
HATH
GIVEN
HIM
AUTHORITY
TO
EXECUTE
JUDGMENT
ALSO
BECAUSE
HE
IS
THE
SON
OF
MAN
MARVEL
NOT
AT
THIS
FOR
THE
HOUR
IS
COMING
IN
THE
WHICH
ALL
THAT
ARE

GRAVES
SHALL
HEAR
HIS

AND
SHALL
COME
FORTH
THEY
THAT
HAVE
DONE
GOOD
UNTO
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
LIFE
AND
THEY
THAT
HAVE
DONE
EVIL
UNTO
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
DAMNATION
I
CAN
OF
MINE
OWN
SELF
DO
NOTHING
AS
I
HEAR
I
JUDGE
AND
MY
JUDGMENT
IS
JUST
BECAUSE
I
SEEK
NOT
MINE
OWN
WILL
BUT
THE
WILL
OF
THE
FATHER
WHICH
HATH
SENT
ME
IF
I
BEAR
WITNESS
OF
MYSELF
MY
WITNESS
IS
NOT
TRUE
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
THAT
BEARETH
WITNESS
OF
ME
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
WITNESS
WHICH
HE
WITNESSETH
OF
ME
IS
TRUE
YE
SENT
UNTO
JOHN
AND
HE
BARE
WITNESS
UNTO
THE
TRUTH
BUT
I
RECEIVE
NOT
TESTIMONY
FROM
MAN
BUT
THESE
THINGS
I
SAY
THAT
YE
MIGHT
BE
SAVED
HE
WAS
A
BURNING
AND
A
SHINING
LIGHT
AND
YE
WERE
WILLING
FOR
A
SEASON
TO
REJOICE
IN
HIS
LIGHT
BUT
I
HAVE
GREATER
WITNESS
THAN
THAT
OF
JOHN
FOR
THE
WORKS
WHICH
THE
FATHER
HATH
GIVEN
ME
TO
FINISH
THE
SAME
WORKS
THAT
I
DO
BEAR
WITNESS
OF
ME
THAT
THE
FATHER
HATH
SENT
ME
AND
THE
FATHER
HIMSELF
WHICH
HATH
SENT
ME
HATH
BORNE
WITNESS
OF
ME
YE
HAVE
NEITHER
HEARD
HIS
VOICE
AT
ANY
TIME
NOR
SEEN
HIS
SHAPE
AND
YE
HAVE
NOT
HIS
WORD
ABIDING
IN
YOU
FOR
WHOM
HE
HATH
SENT
HIM
YE
BELIEVE
NOT
SEARCH
THE
SCRIPTURES
FOR
IN
THEM
YE
THINK
YE
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
THEY
ARE
THEY
WHICH
TESTIFY
OF
ME
AND
YE
WILL
NOT
COME
TO
ME
THAT
YE
MIGHT
HAVE
LIFE
I
RECEIVE
NOT
HONOUR
FROM
MEN
BUT
I
KNOW
YOU
THAT
YE
HAVE
NOT
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
IN
YOU
I
AM
COME
IN
MY
FATHER'S
NAME
AND
YE
RECEIVE
ME
NOT
IF
ANOTHER
SHALL
COME
IN
HIS
OWN
NAME
HIM
YE
WILL
RECEIVE
HOW
CAN
YE
BELIEVE
WHICH
RECEIVE
HONOUR
ONE
OF
ANOTHER
AND
SEEK
NOT
THE
HONOUR
THAT
COMETH
FROM
GOD
ONLY
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
I
WILL
ACCUSE
YOU
TO
THE
FATHER
THERE
IS
ONE
THAT
ACCUSETH
YOU
EVEN
MOSES
IN
WHOM
YE
TRUST
FOR
HAD
YE
BELIEVED
MOSES
YE
WOULD
HAVE
BELIEVED
ME
FOR
HE
WROTE
OF
ME
BUT
IF
YE
BELIEVE
NOT
HIS
WRITINGS
HOW
SHALL
YE
BELIEVE
MY
WORDS
AFTER
THESE
THINGS
JESUS
WENT
OVER
THE
SEA
OF
GALILEE
WHICH
IS
THE
SEA
OF
TIBERIAS
AND
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
FOLLOWED
HIM
BECAUSE
THEY
SAW
HIS
MIRACLES
WHICH
HE
DID
ON
THEM
THAT
WERE
DISEASED
AND
JESUS
WENT
UP
INTO
A
MOUNTAIN
AND
THERE
HE
SAT
WITH
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
PASSOVER
A
FEAST
OF
THE
JEWS
WAS
NIGH
WHEN
JESUS
THEN
LIFTED
UP
HIS
EYES
AND
SAW
A
GREAT
COMPANY
COME
UNTO
HIM
HE
SAITH
UNTO
PHILIP
WHENCE
SHALL
WE
BUY
BREAD
THAT
THESE
MAY
EAT
AND
THIS
HE
SAID
TO
PROVE
HIM
FOR
HE
HIMSELF
KNEW
WHAT
HE
WOULD
DO
PHILIP
ANSWERED
HIM
TWO
HUNDRED
PENNYWORTH
OF
BREAD
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THEM
THAT
EVERY
ONE
OF
THEM
MAY
TAKE
A
LITTLE
ONE
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
ANDREW
SIMON
PETER'S
BROTHER
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
THERE
IS
A
LAD
HERE
WHICH
HATH
FIVE
BARLEY
LOAVES
AND
TWO
SMALL
FISHES
BUT
WHAT
ARE
THEY
AMONG
SO
MANY
AND
JESUS
SAID
MAKE
THE
MEN
SIT
DOWN
NOW
THERE
WAS
MUCH
GRASS
IN
THE
PLACE
SO
THE
MEN
SAT
DOWN
IN
NUMBER
ABOUT
FIVE
THOUSAND
AND
JESUS
TOOK
THE
LOAVES
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
GIVEN
THANKS
HE
DISTRIBUTED
TO
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
THEM
THAT
WERE
SET
DOWN
AND
LIKEWISE
OF
THE
FISHES
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
WOULD
WHEN
THEY
WERE
FILLED
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
GATHER
UP
THE
FRAGMENTS
THAT
REMAIN
THAT
NOTHING
BE
LOST
THEREFORE
THEY
GATHERED
THEM
TOGETHER
AND
FILLED
TWELVE
BASKETS
WITH
THE
FRAGMENTS
OF
THE
FIVE
BARLEY
LOAVES
WHICH
REMAINED
OVER
AND
ABOVE
UNTO
THEM
THAT
HAD
EATEN
THEN
THOSE
MEN
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SEEN
THE
MIRACLE
THAT
JESUS
DID
SAID
THIS
IS
OF
A
TRUTH
THAT
PROPHET
THAT
SHOULD
COME
INTO
THE
WORLD
WHEN
JESUS
THEREFORE
PERCEIVED
THAT
THEY
WOULD
COME
AND
TAKE
HIM
BY
FORCE
TO
MAKE
HIM
A
KING
HE
DEPARTED
AGAIN
INTO
A
MOUNTAIN
HIMSELF
ALONE
AND
WHEN
EVEN
WAS
NOW
COME
HIS
DISCIPLES
WENT
DOWN
UNTO
THE
SEA
AND
ENTERED
INTO
A
SHIP
AND
WENT
OVER
THE
SEA
TOWARD
CAPERNAUM
AND
IT
WAS
NOW
DARK
AND
JESUS
WAS
NOT
COME
TO
THEM
AND
THE
SEA
AROSE
BY
REASON
OF
A
GREAT
WIND
THAT
BLEW
SO
WHEN
THEY
HAD
ROWED
ABOUT
FIVE
AND
TWENTY
OR
THIRTY
FURLONGS
THEY
SEE
JESUS
WALKING
ON
THE
SEA
AND
DRAWING
NIGH
UNTO
THE
SHIP
AND
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
BUT
HE
SAITH
UNTO
THEM
IT
IS
I
BE
NOT
AFRAID
THEN
THEY
WILLINGLY
RECEIVED
HIM
INTO
THE
SHIP
AND
IMMEDIATELY
THE
SHIP
WAS
AT
THE
LAND
WHITHER
THEY
WENT
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
WHICH
STOOD
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
SEA
SAW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NONE
OTHER
BOAT
THERE
SAVE
THAT
ONE
WHEREINTO
HIS
DISCIPLES
WERE
ENTERED
AND
THAT
JESUS
WENT
NOT
WITH
HIS
DISCIPLES
INTO
THE
BOAT
BUT
THAT
HIS
DISCIPLES
WERE
GONE
AWAY
ALONE
HOWBEIT
THERE
CAME
OTHER
BOATS
FROM
TIBERIAS
NIGH
UNTO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
DID
EAT
BREAD
AFTER
THAT
THE
LORD
HAD
GIVEN
THANKS
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
THEREFORE
SAW
THAT
JESUS
WAS
NOT
THERE
NEITHER
HIS
DISCIPLES
THEY
ALSO
TOOK
SHIPPING
AND
CAME
TO
CAPERNAUM
SEEKING
FOR
JESUS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
FOUND
HIM
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
SEA
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
RABBI
WHEN
CAMEST
THOU
HITHER
JESUS
ANSWERED
THEM
AND
SAID
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
YE
SEEK
ME
NOT
BECAUSE
YE
SAW
THE
MIRACLES
BUT
BECAUSE
YE
DID
EAT
OF
THE
LOAVES
AND
WERE
FILLED
LABOUR
NOT
FOR
THE
MEAT
WHICH
PERISHETH
BUT
FOR
THAT
MEAT
WHICH
ENDURETH
UNTO
EVERLASTING
LIFE
WHICH
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
GIVE
UNTO
YOU
FOR
HIM
HATH
GOD
THE
FATHER
SEALED
THEN
SAID
THEY
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
SHALL
WE
DO
THAT
WE
MIGHT
WORK
THE
WORKS
OF
GOD
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THIS
IS
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
THAT
YE
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
WHOM
HE
HATH
SENT
THEY
SAID
THEREFORE
UNTO
HIM
WHAT
SIGN
SHEWEST
THOU
THEN
THAT
WE
MAY
SEE
AND
BELIEVE
THEE
WHAT
DOST
THOU
WORK
OUR
FATHERS
DID
EAT
MANNA
IN
THE
DESERT
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
HE
GAVE
THEM
BREAD
FROM
HEAVEN
TO

THEN
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
MOSES
GAVE
YOU
NOT
THAT
BREAD
FROM
HEAVEN
BUT
MY
FATHER
GIVETH
YOU
THE
TRUE
BREAD
FROM
HEAVEN
FOR
THE
BREAD
OF
GOD
IS
HE
WHICH
COMETH
DOWN
FROM

AND
GIVETH
LIFE
UNTO
THE

THEN
SAID
THEY
UNTO

AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM

HE
THAT
COMETH
TO
ME
SHALL
NEVER
HUNGER
AND
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON

SHALL
NEVER
THIRST
BUT
I
SAID
UNTO
YOU
THAT
YE
ALSO
HAVE
SEEN
ME
AND
BELIEVE
NOT
ALL
THAT
THE
FATHER
GIVETH
ME
SHALL
COME
TO
ME
AND
HIM
THAT
COMETH
TO
ME
I
WILL
IN
NO
WISE
CAST
OUT
FOR
I
CAME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
NOT
TO
DO
MINE
OWN
WILL
BUT
THE
WILL
OF
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
AND
THIS
IS
THE
FATHER'S
WILL
WHICH
HATH
SENT
ME
THAT
OF
ALL
WHICH
HE
HATH
GIVEN
ME
I
SHOULD
LOSE
NOTHING
BUT
SHOULD
RAISE
IT
UP
AGAIN
AT
THE
LAST
DAY
AND
THIS
IS
THE
WILL
OF
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
THAT
EVERY
ONE
WHICH
SEETH
THE
SON
AND
BELIEVETH
ON
HIM
MAY
HAVE
EVERLASTING
LIFE
AND
I
WILL
RAISE
HIM
UP
AT
THE
LAST
DAY
THE
JEWS
THEN
MURMURED
AT
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
SAID
I
AM
THE
BREAD
WHICH
CAME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
AND
THEY
SAID
IS
NOT
THIS
JESUS
THE
SON
OF
JOSEPH
WHOSE
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
WE
KNOW
HOW
IS
IT
THEN
THAT
HE
SAITH
I
CAME
DOWN
FROM

JESUS
THEREFORE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
MURMUR
NOT
AMONG
YOURSELVES
NO
MAN
CAN
COME
TO
ME
EXCEPT
THE
FATHER
WHICH
HATH
SENT
ME
DRAW

AND
I
WILL
RAISE
HIM
UP
AT
THE
LAST
DAY
IT
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
PROPHETS
AND
THEY
SHALL
BE
ALL
TAUGHT
OF
GOD
EVERY
MAN
THEREFORE
THAT
HATH
HEARD
AND
HATH
LEARNED
OF
THE

ANY
MAN
HATH

VERILY
VERILY
I

UNTO
YOU
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON

HATH
EVERLASTING

I
AM
THAT
BREAD
OF
LIFE
YOUR
FATHERS
DID
EAT
MANNA
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
ARE
DEAD
THIS
IS
THE
BREAD
WHICH
COMETH
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
THAT
A
MAN
MAY
EAT
THEREOF
AND
NOT
DIE
I
AM
THE
LIVING
BREAD
WHICH
CAME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
IF
ANY
MAN
EAT
OF
THIS
BREAD
HE
SHALL
LIVE
FOR

AND
THE
BREAD
THAT
I
WILL
GIVE
IS
MY
FLESH
WHICH
I
WILL
GIVE
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
THE

THE
JEWS
THEREFORE
STROVE
AMONG
THEMSELVES
SAYING
HOW
CAN
THIS
MAN
GIVE

THEN
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
EXCEPT

EAT
THE
FLESH
OF
THE
SON
OF
MAN
AND
DRINK
HIS

IN
YOU
WHOSO
EATETH
MY

AND
DRINKETH
MY

HATH
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
I
WILL
RAISE
HIM
UP
AT
THE

DWELLETH
IN
ME
AND
I
IN
HIM
AS
THE
LIVING
FATHER
HATH
SENT
ME
AND
I

BY
THE
FATHER
SO
HE
THAT
EATETH
ME
EVEN
HE
SHALL
LIVE
BY
ME
THIS
IS
THAT
BREAD
WHICH
CAME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
NOT
AS
YOUR
FATHERS
DID
EAT
MANNA
AND
ARE
DEAD
HE
THAT
EATETH
OF
THIS
BREAD
SHALL
LIVE
FOR
EVER
THESE
THINGS
SAID
HE
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AS
HE
TAUGHT
IN
CAPERNAUM
MANY
THEREFORE
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
WHEN
THEY
HAD
HEARD
THIS
SAID
THIS
IS
AN
HARD
SAYING
WHO
CAN
HEAR
IT
WHEN
JESUS
KNEW
IN
HIMSELF
THAT
HIS
DISCIPLES
MURMURED
AT
IT
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
DOTH
THIS
OFFEND
YOU
WHAT
AND
IF
YE
SHALL
SEE
THE
SON
OF
MAN
ASCEND
UP
WHERE
HE
WAS
BEFORE
IT
IS
THE
SPIRIT
THAT
QUICKENETH
THE
FLESH
PROFITETH
NOTHING
THE
WORDS
THAT
I
SPEAK
UNTO
YOU
THEY
ARE
SPIRIT
AND
THEY
ARE
LIFE
BUT
THERE
ARE
SOME
OF
YOU
THAT
BELIEVE
NOT
FOR
JESUS
KNEW
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
WHO
THEY
WERE
THAT
BELIEVED
NOT
AND
WHO
SHOULD
BETRAY
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
THEREFORE
SAID
I
UNTO
YOU
THAT
NO
MAN
CAN
COME
UNTO
ME
EXCEPT
IT
WERE
GIVEN
UNTO
HIM
OF
MY
FATHER
FROM
THAT
TIME
MANY
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
WENT
BACK
AND
WALKED
NO
MORE
WITH
HIM
THEN
SAID
JESUS
UNTO
THE
TWELVE
WILL
YE
ALSO
GO
AWAY
THEN
SIMON
PETER
ANSWERED
HIM
LORD
TO
WHOM
SHALL
WE
GO
THOU
HAST
THE
WORDS
OF
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
WE
BELIEVE
AND
ARE
SURE
THAT
THOU
ART
THAT
CHRIST
THE
SON
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
JESUS
ANSWERED
THEM
HAVE
NOT
I
CHOSEN
YOU
TWELVE
AND
ONE
OF
YOU
IS
A
DEVIL
HE
SPAKE
OF
JUDAS
ISCARIOT
THE
SON
OF
SIMON
FOR
HE
IT
WAS
THAT
SHOULD
BETRAY
HIM
BEING
ONE
OF
THE
TWELVE
AFTER
THESE
THINGS
JESUS
WALKED
IN
GALILEE
FOR
HE
WOULD
NOT
WALK
IN
JEWRY
BECAUSE
THE
JEWS
SOUGHT
TO
KILL
HIM
NOW
THE
JEW'S
FEAST
OF
TABERNACLES
WAS
AT
HAND
HIS
BRETHREN
THEREFORE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
DEPART
HENCE
AND
GO
INTO
JUDAEA
THAT
THY
DISCIPLES
ALSO
MAY
SEE
THE
WORKS
THAT
THOU
DOEST
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
MAN
THAT
DOETH
ANY
THING
IN
SECRET
AND
HE
HIMSELF
SEEKETH
TO
BE
KNOWN
OPENLY
IF
THOU
DO
THESE
THINGS
SHEW
THYSELF
TO
THE
WORLD
FOR
NEITHER
DID
HIS
BRETHREN
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
THEN
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
MY
TIME
IS
NOT
YET
COME
BUT
YOUR
TIME
IS
ALWAY
READY
THE
WORLD
CANNOT
HATE
YOU
BUT
ME
IT
HATETH
BECAUSE
I
TESTIFY
OF
IT
THAT
THE
WORKS
THEREOF
ARE
EVIL
GO
YE
UP
UNTO
THIS
FEAST
I
GO
NOT
UP
YET
UNTO
THIS
FEAST
FOR
MY
TIME
IS
NOT
YET
FULL
COME
WHEN
HE
HAD
SAID
THESE
WORDS
UNTO
THEM
HE
ABODE
STILL
IN
GALILEE
BUT
WHEN
HIS
BRETHREN
WERE
GONE
UP
THEN
WENT
HE
ALSO
UP
UNTO
THE
FEAST
NOT
OPENLY
BUT
AS

WE
KNOW
NOT
HE
IS
OF
AGE
ASK
HIM
HE
SHALL
SPEAK
FOR

THESE
WORDS
SPAKE
HIS
PARENTS
BECAUSE
THEY
FEARED
THE
JEWS
FOR
THE
JEWS
HAD
AGREED
ALREADY
THAT
IF
ANY
MAN
DID
CONFESS
THAT
HE
WAS
CHRIST
HE
SHOULD
BE
PUT
OUT
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
THEREFORE
SAID
HIS

THEN
AGAIN
CALLED

MAN
THAT
WAS
BLIND
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
GIVE
GOD
THE
PRAISE
WE

THAT
THIS
MAN
IS
A
SINNER
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
WHETHER

BE
A
SINNER
OR
NO
I
KNOW
NOT
ONE
THING
I
KNOW
THAT
WHEREAS

THEN
SAID
THEY
TO
HIM
AGAIN
WHAT

HE
TO
THEE
HOW
OPENED
HE
THINE
EYES
HE
ANSWERED
THEM
I
HAVE
TOLD
YOU
ALREADY
AND
YE
DID
NOT
HEAR
WHEREFORE
WOULD
YE
HEAR
IT
AGAIN
WILL
YE
ALSO
BE
HIS
DISCIPLES
THEN
THEY
REVILED
HIM
AND
SAID
THOU
ART
HIS
DISCIPLE
BUT
WE
ARE
MOSES'
DISCIPLES
WE
KNOW
THAT
GOD
SPAKE
UNTO
MOSES
AS
FOR
THIS
FELLOW
WE
KNOW
NOT
FROM
WHENCE
HE
IS
THE
MAN
ANSWERED
AND

WHY
HEREIN

A
MARVELLOUS
THING
THAT
YE

FROM
WHENCE
HE
IS
AND
YET
HE
HATH
OPENED
MINE
EYES
NOW
WE
KNOW
THAT
GOD
HEARETH
NOT
SINNERS
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
BE
A
WORSHIPPER
OF
GOD
AND
DOETH
HIS
WILL
HIM
HE
HEARETH
SINCE
THE
WORLD
BEGAN
WAS
IT
NOT
HEARD
THAT
ANY
MAN
OPENED
THE
EYES
OF
ONE
THAT
WAS
BORN
BLIND
IF
THIS
MAN
WERE
NOT
OF
GOD
HE
COULD
DO
NOTHING
THEY
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
WAST
ALTOGETHER
BORN
IN
SINS
AND
DOST
THOU
TEACH
US
AND
THEY
CAST
HIM
OUT
JESUS
HEARD
THAT
THEY
HAD
CAST
HIM
OUT
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
FOUND
HIM
HE
SAID
UNTO
HIM
DOST
THOU
BELIEVE
ON
THE
SON
OF
GOD
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
WHO
IS
HE
LORD
THAT
I
MIGHT
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
AND
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
HAST
BOTH
SEEN
HIM
AND
IT
IS
HE
THAT
TALKETH
WITH
THEE
AND
HE
SAID
LORD
I
BELIEVE
AND
HE
WORSHIPPED
HIM
AND
JESUS
SAID
FOR
JUDGMENT
I
AM
COME
INTO
THIS
WORLD
THAT
THEY
WHICH
SEE
NOT
MIGHT
SEE
AND
THAT
THEY
WHICH
SEE
MIGHT
BE
MADE
BLIND
AND
SOME
OF
THE
PHARISEES
WHICH
WERE
WITH
HIM
HEARD
THESE
WORDS
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
ARE
WE
BLIND
ALSO
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IF
YE
WERE
BLIND
YE
SHOULD
HAVE
NO
SIN
BUT

YOUR
SIN
REMAINETH
VERILY
VERILY
I

UNTO
YOU
HE

ENTERETH
NOT
BY
THE
DOOR
INTO
THE
SHEEPFOLD
BUT
CLIMBETH
UP
SOME
OTHER
WAY
THE
SAME
IS
A
THIEF
AND
A
ROBBER
BUT
HE
THAT
ENTERETH
IN
BY
THE
DOOR
IS
THE
SHEPHERD
OF
THE
SHEEP
TO
HIM
THE
PORTER
OPENETH
AND
THE
SHEEP
HEAR
HIS
VOICE
AND
HE
CALLETH
HIS
OWN
SHEEP
BY
NAME
AND
LEADETH
THEM
OUT
AND
WHEN
HE
PUTTETH
FORTH
HIS
OWN
SHEEP
HE
GOETH
BEFORE
THEM
AND
THE
SHEEP
FOLLOW
HIM
FOR
THEY
KNOW
HIS
VOICE
AND
A
STRANGER
WILL
THEY
NOT
FOLLOW
BUT
WILL
FLEE
FROM
HIM
FOR
THEY
KNOW
NOT
THE
VOICE
OF
STRANGERS
THIS
PARABLE
SPAKE
JESUS
UNTO
THEM
BUT
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
NOT
WHAT
THINGS
THEY
WERE
WHICH

SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
THEN

VERILY
VERILY
I

BUT
THE
SHEEP
DID
NOT
HEAR
THEM
I
AM
THE
DOOR
BY
ME
IF
ANY
MAN
ENTER
IN
HE
SHALL
BE
SAVED
AND
SHALL
GO
IN
AND
OUT
AND
FIND
PASTURE
THE
THIEF
COMETH
NOT
BUT
FOR
TO
STEAL
AND
TO
KILL
AND
TO
DESTROY
I
AM
COME
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
LIFE
AND
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
IT
MORE
ABUNDANTLY
I
AM
THE
GOOD
SHEPHERD
THE

THIS
COMMANDMENT
HAVE
I

THERE

AND
IT
WAS
AT

THE
FEAST
OF
THE
DEDICATION
AND
IT
WAS
WINTER
AND
JESUS
WALKED
IN
THE
TEMPLE
IN
SOLOMON'S
PORCH
THEN
CAME
THE
JEWS
ROUND
ABOUT
HIM
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
HOW

THE

BELIEVE
THE

SAID
I

THEN
THEY
TOOK
AWAY
THE

WHERE
THE
DEAD
WAS
LAID
AND
JESUS
LIFTED
UP
HIS

NOW
BOTH
THE

HAD
GIVEN
A
COMMANDMENT
THAT
IF
ANY
MAN
KNEW
WHERE

WHERE
LAZARUS
WAS
WHICH
HAD
BEEN

WHOM
HE
RAISED

OF
THE
OINTMENT
THEN
SAITH
ONE
OF
HIS
DISCIPLES
JUDAS
ISCARIOT
SIMON'S
SON
WHICH
SHOULD
BETRAY
HIM
WHY
WAS
NOT
THIS
OINTMENT
SOLD
FOR
THREE
HUNDRED
PENCE
AND
GIVEN
TO
THE
POOR
THIS
HE
SAID
NOT
THAT
HE
CARED
FOR
THE
POOR
BUT
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
A
THIEF
AND
HAD
THE
BAG
AND
BARE
WHAT
WAS
PUT
THEREIN
THEN
SAID
JESUS
LET
HER
ALONE
AGAINST
THE
DAY
OF
MY
BURYING
HATH

KEPT
THIS
FOR
THE
POOR
ALWAYS
YE
HAVE
WITH
YOU
BUT
ME
YE
HAVE
NOT
ALWAYS
MUCH
PEOPLE
OF
THE
JEWS
THEREFORE
KNEW
THAT
HE
WAS
THERE
AND
THEY
CAME
NOT
FOR
JESUS'
SAKE
ONLY
BUT
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
SEE
LAZARUS
ALSO
WHOM
HE
HAD
RAISED
FROM
THE
DEAD
BUT
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
CONSULTED
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
PUT
LAZARUS
ALSO
TO
DEATH
BECAUSE
THAT
BY
REASON
OF
HIM
MANY
OF
THE
JEWS
WENT
AWAY
AND
BELIEVED
ON
JESUS
ON
THE
NEXT
DAY
MUCH
PEOPLE
THAT
WERE
COME
TO
THE
FEAST
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
JESUS
WAS
COMING
TO
JERUSALEM
TOOK
BRANCHES
OF
PALM
TREES
AND
WENT
FORTH
TO
MEET
HIM
AND
CRIED
HOSANNA
BLESSED
IS
THE
KING
OF
ISRAEL
THAT
COMETH
IN

BEHOLD
THY
KING
COMETH
SITTING
ON
AN
ASS'S
COLT
THESE
THINGS
UNDERSTOOD
NOT
HIS
DISCIPLES
AT
THE
FIRST
BUT
WHEN
JESUS
WAS
GLORIFIED
THEN
REMEMBERED
THEY
THAT
THESE
THINGS
WERE
WRITTEN
OF
HIM
AND
THAT
THEY
HAD
DONE
THESE
THINGS
UNTO
HIM
THE
PEOPLE
THEREFORE
THAT
WAS
WITH
HIM
WHEN
HE
CALLED
LAZARUS
OUT
OF
HIS
GRAVE
AND
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
BARE
RECORD
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
THE
PEOPLE
ALSO
MET
HIM
FOR
THAT
THEY
HEARD
THAT
HE
HAD
DONE
THIS
MIRACLE
THE
PHARISEES
THEREFORE
SAID
AMONG
THEMSELVES
PERCEIVE
YE
HOW
YE
PREVAIL
NOTHING
BEHOLD
THE
WORLD
IS
GONE
AFTER
HIM
AND
THERE
WERE
CERTAIN
GREEKS
AMONG
THEM
THAT
CAME
UP
TO
WORSHIP
AT
THE
FEAST
THE
SAME
CAME
THEREFORE
TO
PHILIP
WHICH
WAS
OF
BETHSAIDA
OF
GALILEE
AND
DESIRED
HIM
SAYING
SIR
WE
WOULD
SEE
JESUS
PHILIP
COMETH
AND
TELLETH
ANDREW
AND
AGAIN
ANDREW
AND
PHILIP
TELL
JESUS
AND
JESUS
ANSWERED
THEM
SAYING
THE
HOUR
IS
COME
THAT
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHOULD
BE
GLORIFIED
VERILY
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
EXCEPT
A
CORN
OF
WHEAT
FALL
INTO
THE
GROUND
AND
DIE
IT
ABIDETH
ALONE
BUT
IF
IT
DIE
IT
BRINGETH
FORTH
MUCH
FRUIT
HE
THAT
LOVETH
HIS
LIFE
SHALL
LOSE
IT
AND
HE
THAT
HATETH
HIS
LIFE
IN
THIS
WORLD
SHALL
KEEP
IT
UNTO
LIFE
ETERNAL
IF
ANY
MAN
SERVE
ME
LET
HIM
FOLLOW
ME
AND
WHERE
I
AM
THERE
SHALL
ALSO
MY
SERVANT
BE
IF
ANY
MAN
SERVE
ME
HIM
WILL
MY
FATHER
HONOUR
NOW
IS
MY
SOUL
TROUBLED
AND
WHAT
SHALL
I
SAY
FATHER
SAVE
ME
FROM
THIS
HOUR
BUT
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
CAME
I
UNTO
THIS
HOUR
FATHER
GLORIFY
THY
NAME
THEN
CAME
THERE
A
VOICE
FROM
HEAVEN
SAYING
I
HAVE
BOTH
GLORIFIED
IT
AND
WILL
GLORIFY
IT
AGAIN
THE
PEOPLE
THEREFORE
THAT
STOOD
BY
AND
HEARD
IT
SAID
THAT
IT
THUNDERED
OTHERS
SAID
AN
ANGEL
SPAKE
TO
HIM
JESUS
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
THIS
VOICE
CAME
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
ME
BUT
FOR
YOUR
SAKES
NOW
IS
THE
JUDGMENT
OF
THIS
WORLD
NOW
SHALL
THE
PRINCE
OF
THIS
WORLD
BE
CAST
OUT
AND
I
IF
I
BE
LIFTED
UP
FROM
THE
EARTH
WILL
DRAW
ALL
MEN
UNTO
ME
THIS
HE
SAID
SIGNIFYING
WHAT
DEATH
HE
SHOULD
DIE
THE
PEOPLE
ANSWERED
HIM
WE
HAVE
HEARD
OUT
OF
THE
LAW
THAT
CHRIST
ABIDETH
FOR
EVER
AND
HOW
SAYEST
THOU
THE
SON
OF
MAN
MUST
BE
LIFTED
UP
WHO
IS
THIS
SON
OF
MAN
THEN
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YET
A
LITTLE
WHILE
IS
THE
LIGHT
WITH
YOU
WALK
WHILE
YE
HAVE
THE
LIGHT
LEST
DARKNESS
COME
UPON
YOU
FOR
HE
THAT
WALKETH
IN
DARKNESS
KNOWETH
NOT
WHITHER
HE
GOETH
WHILE
YE
HAVE
LIGHT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
LIGHT
THAT
YE
MAY
BE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
LIGHT
THESE
THINGS
SPAKE
JESUS
AND
DEPARTED
AND
DID
HIDE
HIMSELF
FROM
THEM
BUT
THOUGH
HE
HAD
DONE
SO
MANY
MIRACLES
BEFORE
THEM
YET
THEY
BELIEVED
NOT
ON
HIM
THAT
THE
SAYING
OF
ESAIAS
THE
PROPHET
MIGHT
BE
FULFILLED
WHICH
HE
SPAKE
LORD
WHO
HATH
BELIEVED
OUR
REPORT
AND
TO
WHOM
HATH
THE
ARM
OF
THE
LORD
BEEN
REVEALED
THEREFORE
THEY
COULD
NOT
BELIEVE
BECAUSE
THAT
ESAIAS
SAID
AGAIN
HE
HATH
BLINDED
THEIR
EYES
AND
HARDENED
THEIR
HEART
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
SEE
WITH
THEIR
EYES
NOR
UNDERSTAND
WITH
THEIR
HEART
AND
BE
CONVERTED
AND
I
SHOULD
HEAL
THEM
THESE
THINGS
SAID
ESAIAS
WHEN
HE
SAW
HIS
GLORY
AND
SPAKE
OF
HIM
NEVERTHELESS
AMONG
THE
CHIEF
RULERS
ALSO
MANY
BELIEVED
ON
HIM
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PHARISEES
THEY
DID
NOT
CONFESS
HIM
LEST
THEY
SHOULD
BE
PUT
OUT
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
FOR
THEY
LOVED
THE
PRAISE
OF
MEN
MORE
THAN
THE
PRAISE
OF
GOD
JESUS
CRIED
AND
SAID
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON
ME
BELIEVETH
NOT
ON
ME
BUT
ON
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
AND
HE
THAT
SEETH
ME
SEETH
HIM
THAT
SENT
ME
I
AM
COME
A
LIGHT
INTO
THE
WORLD
THAT
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
ON
ME
SHOULD
NOT
ABIDE
IN
DARKNESS
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
HEAR
MY
WORDS
AND
BELIEVE
NOT
I
JUDGE
HIM
NOT
FOR
I
CAME
NOT
TO
JUDGE
THE
WORLD
BUT
TO
SAVE
THE
WORLD
HE
THAT
REJECTETH
ME
AND
RECEIVETH
NOT
MY
WORDS
HATH
ONE
THAT
JUDGETH
HIM
THE
WORD
THAT
I
HAVE
SPOKEN
THE
SAME
SHALL
JUDGE
HIM
IN
THE
LAST
DAY
FOR
I
HAVE
NOT
SPOKEN
OF
MYSELF
BUT
THE
FATHER
WHICH
SENT
ME
HE
GAVE
ME
A
COMMANDMENT
WHAT
I
SHOULD
SAY
AND
WHAT
I
SHOULD
SPEAK
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
HIS
COMMANDMENT
IS
LIFE
EVERLASTING
WHATSOEVER
I
SPEAK
THEREFORE
EVEN
AS
THE
FATHER
SAID
UNTO
ME
SO
I
SPEAK
NOW
BEFORE
THE
FEAST
OF
THE
PASSOVER
WHEN
JESUS
KNEW
THAT
HIS
HOUR
WAS
COME
THAT
HE
SHOULD
DEPART
OUT
OF
THIS
WORLD
UNTO
THE
FATHER
HAVING
LOVED
HIS
OWN
WHICH
WERE
IN
THE
WORLD
HE
LOVED
THEM
UNTO
THE
END
AND
SUPPER
BEING
ENDED
THE
DEVIL
HAVING
NOW
PUT
INTO
THE
HEART
OF
JUDAS
ISCARIOT
SIMON'S
SON
TO
BETRAY
HIM
JESUS
KNOWING
THAT
THE
FATHER
HAD
GIVEN
ALL
THINGS
INTO
HIS
HANDS
AND
THAT
HE
WAS
COME
FROM
GOD
AND
WENT
TO
GOD
HE
RISETH
FROM
SUPPER
AND
LAID
ASIDE
HIS
GARMENTS
AND
TOOK
A
TOWEL
AND
GIRDED
HIMSELF
AFTER
THAT
HE
POURETH
WATER
INTO
A
BASON
AND
BEGAN
TO
WASH
THE
DISCIPLES'
FEET
AND
TO
WIPE
THEM
WITH
THE
TOWEL
WHEREWITH
HE
WAS
GIRDED
THEN
COMETH
HE
TO
SIMON
PETER
AND
PETER
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
LORD
DOST

JESUS
ANSWERED
AND

WASHED
NEEDETH
NOT
SAVE
TO
WASH
HIS
FEET
BUT

CLEAN
EVERY

CLEAN
BUT
NOT

FOR
HE
KNEW
WHO

CLEAN
SO
AFTER
HE
HAD
WASHED
THEIR
FEET
AND
HAD
TAKEN
HIS
GARMENTS
AND
WAS
SET
DOWN
AGAIN
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM

HAVE
DONE
TO
YOU
YE
CALL
ME
MASTER
AND
LORD
AND
YE
SAY

HATH
LIFTED
UP
HIS
HEEL
AGAINST

NO
MAN
AT

TABLE
KNEW
FOR
WHAT
INTENT

NOT
HAD
SIN
BUT
NOW
THEY

NO
CLOAK
FOR

HE
THAT

HATETH
MY

WILL
SEND
UNTO

FROM

EVEN
THE

WHICH
PROCEEDETH
FROM

WHOSOEVER
KILLETH
YOU

WHEN
HE
IS
COME
HE
WILL
REPROVE
THE
WORLD
OF
SIN
AND
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
OF
JUDGMENT
OF
SIN
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVE
NOT
ON
ME
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BECAUSE
I
GO
TO
MY
FATHER
AND
YE
SEE
ME
NO
MORE
OF

THE
WHICH
IF

AMEN
THE

TREATISE
HAVE
I

OF

AFTER
THAT
HE
THROUGH
THE

GHOST
HAD
GIVEN
COMMANDMENTS
UNTO
THE
APOSTLES
WHOM
HE
HAD
CHOSEN
TO
WHOM
ALSO
HE
SHEWED
HIMSELF
ALIVE
AFTER

BY
MANY
INFALLIBLE
PROOFS
BEING
SEEN
OF

FORTY
DAYS
AND
SPEAKING
OF
THE
THINGS
PERTAINING
TO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
BEING
ASSEMBLED
TOGETHER
WITH
THEM
COMMANDED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
DEPART
FROM
JERUSALEM
BUT
WAIT
FOR
THE
PROMISE
OF
THE
FATHER
WHICH
SAITH
HE
YE
HAVE
HEARD
OF
ME
FOR
JOHN
TRULY
BAPTIZED
WITH
WATER
BUT
YE
SHALL
BE
BAPTIZED
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
NOT
MANY
DAYS
HENCE
WHEN

THEREFORE
WERE
COME
TOGETHER
THEY
ASKED
OF
HIM
SAYING
LORD
WILT
THOU
AT
THIS
TIME
RESTORE
AGAIN
THE
KINGDOM
TO
ISRAEL
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IT
IS
NOT
FOR
YOU
TO
KNOW
THE
TIMES
OR
THE
SEASONS
WHICH
THE
FATHER
HATH
PUT
IN
HIS

POWER
AFTER

RECEIVED
HIM
OUT
OF

LOOKED
STEDFASTLY
TOWARD
HEAVEN
AS

WENT
UP
BEHOLD
TWO

IN
WHITE
APPAREL

ALSO
SAID
YE
MEN

GAZING
UP
INTO

THIS

JESUS
WHICH
IS
TAKEN
UP
FROM
YOU
INTO
HEAVEN
SHALL
SO
COME
IN
LIKE
MANNER
AS
YE
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
GO
INTO

THEN
RETURNED
THEY
UNTO
JERUSALEM
FROM

BRETHREN
I
WOT
THAT
THROUGH
IGNORANCE
YE

GOD
BEFORE
HAD
SHEWED
BY
THE
MOUTH
OF
ALL
HIS

THAT
CHRIST
SHOULD
SUFFER
HE
HATH
SO
FULFILLED
REPENT
YE
THEREFORE
AND

MAY
BE
BLOTTED
OUT
WHEN
THE
TIMES
OF
REFRESHING
SHALL
COME
FROM
THE

JESUS
SENT
HIM
TO

YOU
IN

AWAY
EVERY

AND
AS
THEY
SPAKE
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
THE
PRIESTS
AND
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
TEMPLE
AND
THE
SADDUCEES
CAME
UPON
THEM
BEING
GRIEVED
THAT
THEY
TAUGHT
THE
PEOPLE
AND
PREACHED
THROUGH
JESUS
THE
RESURRECTION
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
THEY
LAID
HANDS
ON
THEM
AND
PUT
THEM
IN

UNTO
THE
NEXT
DAY
FOR
IT
WAS
NOW
EVENTIDE
HOWBEIT
MANY
OF
THEM
WHICH
HEARD
THE
WORD
BELIEVED
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
MEN
WAS
ABOUT
FIVE
THOUSAND
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
ON
THE
MORROW
THAT
THEIR
RULERS
AND
ELDERS
AND
SCRIBES
AND
ANNAS
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
AND
CAIAPHAS
AND
JOHN
AND
ALEXANDER
AND
AS
MANY
AS
WERE
OF
THE
KINDRED
OF
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SET
THEM
IN
THE
MIDST
THEY
ASKED
BY
WHAT
POWER
OR
BY
WHAT
NAME
HAVE
YE
DONE
THIS
THEN
PETER
FILLED
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
RULERS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
ELDERS
OF
ISRAEL
IF
WE
THIS
DAY
BE
EXAMINED
OF
THE
GOOD
DEED
DONE
TO
THE

MAN
BY
WHAT
MEANS
HE
IS
MADE

KNOWN
UNTO
YOU
ALL
AND
TO
ALL
THE

THAT
BY

WHOM
YE
CRUCIFIED
WHOM
GOD
RAISED
FROM
THE
DEAD
EVEN
BY
HIM
DOTH
THIS
MAN
STAND
HERE
BEFORE
YOU
WHOLE
THIS
IS
THE
STONE
WHICH
WAS
SET
AT
NOUGHT
OF
YOU
BUILDERS
WHICH
IS
BECOME
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
CORNER
NEITHER
IS
THERE
SALVATION
IN
ANY
OTHER
FOR
THERE
IS
NONE
OTHER
NAME
UNDER
HEAVEN
GIVEN
AMONG
MEN
WHEREBY
WE
MUST
BE
SAVED
NOW
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
BOLDNESS
OF
PETER
AND
JOHN
AND
PERCEIVED
THAT
THEY
WERE
UNLEARNED
AND
IGNORANT
MEN
THEY
MARVELLED
AND
THEY
TOOK
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THEM
THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
WITH
JESUS
AND
BEHOLDING
THE
MAN
WHICH
WAS
HEALED
STANDING
WITH
THEM
THEY
COULD
SAY
NOTHING
AGAINST
IT
BUT
WHEN
THEY
HAD
COMMANDED
THEM
TO
GO
ASIDE
OUT
OF
THE
COUNCIL
THEY
CONFERRED
AMONG
THEMSELVES
SAYING
WHAT
SHALL
WE
DO
TO
THESE
MEN
FOR
THAT
INDEED
A
NOTABLE
MIRACLE
HATH
BEEN
DONE
BY
THEM
IS
MANIFEST
TO
ALL
THEM
THAT
DWELL
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
WE
CANNOT
DENY
IT
BUT
THAT
IT
SPREAD
NO
FURTHER
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
LET
US
STRAITLY
THREATEN
THEM
THAT
THEY
SPEAK
HENCEFORTH
TO
NO
MAN
IN
THIS
NAME
AND
THEY
CALLED
THEM
AND
COMMANDED
THEM
NOT
TO
SPEAK
AT
ALL
NOR
TEACH
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
BUT
PETER
AND
JOHN
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
WHETHER
IT
BE
RIGHT
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD
TO
HEARKEN
UNTO
YOU
MORE
THAN
UNTO
GOD
JUDGE
YE
FOR
WE
CANNOT
BUT
SPEAK
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WE
HAVE
SEEN
AND
HEARD
SO
WHEN
THEY
HAD
FURTHER
THREATENED
THEM
THEY
LET
THEM
GO
FINDING
NOTHING
HOW
THEY
MIGHT
PUNISH
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
ALL
MEN
GLORIFIED
GOD
FOR
THAT
WHICH
WAS
DONE
FOR
THE
MAN
WAS
ABOVE
FORTY
YEARS
OLD
ON
WHOM
THIS
MIRACLE
OF
HEALING
WAS
SHEWED
AND
BEING
LET
GO
THEY
WENT
TO
THEIR
OWN
COMPANY
AND
REPORTED
ALL
THAT
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
ELDERS
HAD
SAID
UNTO
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
THEY
LIFTED
UP
THEIR
VOICE
TO
GOD
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
AND
SAID
LORD
THOU
ART
GOD
WHICH
HAST
MADE
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
AND
THE
SEA
AND
ALL
THAT
IN
THEM
IS
WHO
BY
THE
MOUTH
OF
THY
SERVANT
DAVID
HAST
SAID
WHY
DID
THE
HEATHEN
RAGE
AND
THE
PEOPLE
IMAGINE
VAIN
THINGS
THE
KINGS
OF
THE
EARTH
STOOD
UP
AND
THE
RULERS
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
AGAINST
THE
LORD
AND
AGAINST
HIS
CHRIST
FOR
OF
A
TRUTH
AGAINST
THY
HOLY
CHILD
JESUS
WHOM
THOU
HAST
ANOINTED
BOTH
HEROD
AND
PONTIUS
PILATE
WITH
THE
GENTILES
AND
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
FOR
TO
DO
WHATSOEVER
THY
HAND
AND
THY
COUNSEL
DETERMINED
BEFORE
TO
BE
DONE
AND
NOW
LORD
BEHOLD
THEIR
THREATENINGS
AND
GRANT
UNTO
THY
SERVANTS
THAT
WITH
ALL
BOLDNESS
THEY
MAY
SPEAK
THY
WORD
BY
STRETCHING
FORTH
THINE
HAND
TO
HEAL
AND
THAT
SIGNS
AND
WONDERS
MAY
BE
DONE
BY
THE
NAME
OF
THY
HOLY
CHILD
JESUS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
PRAYED
THE
PLACE
WAS
SHAKEN
WHERE
THEY
WERE
ASSEMBLED
TOGETHER
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
FILLED
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
THEY
SPAKE
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
WITH
BOLDNESS
AND
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THEM
THAT
BELIEVED
WERE
OF
ONE
HEART
AND
OF
ONE
SOUL
NEITHER
SAID
ANY
OF
THEM
THAT
OUGHT
OF
THE
THINGS
WHICH
HE
POSSESSED
WAS
HIS
OWN
BUT
THEY
HAD
ALL
THINGS
COMMON
AND
WITH
GREAT
POWER
GAVE
THE
APOSTLES
WITNESS
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
AND
GREAT
GRACE
WAS
UPON
THEM
ALL
NEITHER
WAS
THERE
ANY
AMONG
THEM
THAT
LACKED
FOR
AS
MANY
AS
WERE
POSSESSORS
OF
LANDS
OR
HOUSES
SOLD
THEM
AND
BROUGHT
THE
PRICES
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
WERE
SOLD
AND
LAID
THEM
DOWN
AT
THE
APOSTLES'
FEET
AND
DISTRIBUTION
WAS
MADE
UNTO
EVERY
MAN
ACCORDING
AS
HE
HAD
NEED
AND
JOSES
WHO
BY
THE
APOSTLES
WAS
SURNAMED
BARNABAS
WHICH
IS
BEING
INTERPRETED
THE
SON
OF
CONSOLATION
A
LEVITE
AND
OF
THE
COUNTRY
OF
CYPRUS
HAVING
LAND
SOLD
IT
AND
BROUGHT
THE
MONEY
AND
LAID
IT
AT
THE
APOSTLES'
FEET
BUT
A
CERTAIN
MAN
NAMED
ANANIAS
WITH
SAPPHIRA
HIS
WIFE
SOLD
A
POSSESSION
AND
KEPT
BACK
PART
OF
THE
PRICE
HIS
WIFE
ALSO
BEING
PRIVY
TO
IT
AND
BROUGHT
A
CERTAIN
PART
AND
LAID
IT
AT
THE
APOSTLES'
FEET
BUT
PETER
SAID
ANANIAS
WHY
HATH
SATAN
FILLED
THINE
HEART
TO
LIE
TO
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
TO
KEEP
BACK
PART
OF
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
LAND
WHILES
IT
REMAINED
WAS
IT
NOT
THINE
OWN
AND
AFTER
IT
WAS
SOLD
WAS
IT
NOT
IN
THINE
OWN
POWER
WHY
HAST
THOU
CONCEIVED
THIS
THING
IN
THINE
HEART
THOU
HAST
NOT
LIED
UNTO
MEN
BUT
UNTO
GOD
AND
ANANIAS
HEARING
THESE
WORDS
FELL
DOWN
AND
GAVE
UP
THE
GHOST
AND
GREAT
FEAR
CAME
ON
ALL
THEM
THAT
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
AND
THE
YOUNG
MEN
AROSE
WOUND
HIM
UP
AND
CARRIED
HIM
OUT
AND
BURIED
HIM
AND
IT
WAS
ABOUT
THE
SPACE
OF
THREE
HOURS
AFTER
WHEN
HIS
WIFE
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
WAS
DONE
CAME
IN
AND
PETER
ANSWERED
UNTO
HER
TELL
ME
WHETHER
YE
SOLD
THE
LAND
FOR
SO
MUCH
AND
SHE
SAID
YEA
FOR
SO
MUCH
THEN
PETER
SAID
UNTO
HER
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
YE
HAVE
AGREED
TOGETHER
TO
TEMPT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
LORD
BEHOLD
THE
FEET
OF
THEM
WHICH
HAVE
BURIED
THY
HUSBAND
ARE
AT
THE
DOOR
AND
SHALL
CARRY
THEE
OUT
THEN
FELL
SHE
DOWN
STRAIGHTWAY
AT
HIS
FEET
AND
YIELDED
UP
THE
GHOST
AND
THE
YOUNG
MEN
CAME
IN
AND
FOUND
HER
DEAD
AND
CARRYING
HER
FORTH
BURIED
HER
BY
HER
HUSBAND
AND
GREAT
FEAR
CAME
UPON
ALL
THE
CHURCH
AND
UPON
AS
MANY
AS
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
AND
BY
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
APOSTLES
WERE
MANY
SIGNS
AND
WONDERS
WROUGHT
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
IN
SOLOMON'S
PORCH
AND
OF
THE
REST
DURST
NO
MAN
JOIN
HIMSELF
TO
THEM
BUT
THE
PEOPLE
MAGNIFIED
THEM
AND
BELIEVERS
WERE
THE
MORE
ADDED
TO
THE
LORD
MULTITUDES
BOTH
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN
INSOMUCH
THAT
THEY
BROUGHT
FORTH
THE
SICK
INTO
THE
STREETS
AND
LAID
THEM
ON
BEDS
AND
COUCHES
THAT
AT
THE
LEAST
THE
SHADOW
OF
PETER
PASSING
BY
MIGHT
OVERSHADOW
SOME
OF
THEM
THERE
CAME
ALSO
A
MULTITUDE
OUT
OF
THE
CITIES
ROUND
ABOUT
UNTO
JERUSALEM
BRINGING
SICK
FOLKS
AND
THEM
WHICH
WERE
VEXED
WITH
UNCLEAN
SPIRITS
AND
THEY
WERE
HEALED
EVERY
ONE
THEN
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
ROSE
UP
AND
ALL
THEY
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
WHICH
IS
THE
SECT
OF
THE
SADDUCEES
AND
WERE
FILLED
WITH
INDIGNATION
AND
LAID
THEIR
HANDS
ON
THE
APOSTLES
AND
PUT
THEM
IN
THE
COMMON
PRISON
BUT
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
BY
NIGHT
OPENED
THE
PRISON
DOORS
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
FORTH
AND
SAID
GO
STAND
AND
SPEAK
IN
THE
TEMPLE
TO
THE
PEOPLE
ALL
THE
WORDS
OF
THIS
LIFE
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
THEY
ENTERED
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
AND
TAUGHT
BUT
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
CAME
AND
THEY
THAT
WERE
WITH
HIM
AND
CALLED
THE
COUNCIL
TOGETHER
AND
ALL
THE
SENATE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
SENT
TO
THE
PRISON
TO
HAVE
THEM
BROUGHT
BUT
WHEN
THE
OFFICERS
CAME
AND
FOUND
THEM
NOT
IN
THE
PRISON
THEY
RETURNED
AND
TOLD
SAYING
THE
PRISON
TRULY
FOUND
WE
SHUT
WITH
ALL
SAFETY
AND
THE
KEEPERS
STANDING
WITHOUT
BEFORE
THE
DOORS
BUT
WHEN
WE
HAD
OPENED
WE
FOUND
NO
MAN
WITHIN
NOW
WHEN
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
AND
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
TEMPLE
AND
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
THEY
DOUBTED
OF
THEM
WHEREUNTO
THIS
WOULD
GROW
THEN
CAME
ONE
AND
TOLD
THEM
SAYING
BEHOLD
THE
MEN
WHOM
YE
PUT
IN
PRISON
ARE
STANDING
IN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
TEACHING
THE
PEOPLE
THEN
WENT
THE
CAPTAIN
WITH
THE
OFFICERS
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
WITHOUT
VIOLENCE
FOR
THEY
FEARED
THE
PEOPLE
LEST
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
STONED
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
BROUGHT
THEM
THEY
SET
THEM
BEFORE
THE
COUNCIL
AND
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
ASKED
THEM
SAYING
DID
NOT
WE
STRAITLY
COMMAND
YOU
THAT
YE
SHOULD
NOT
TEACH
IN
THIS
NAME
AND
BEHOLD
YE
HAVE
FILLED
JERUSALEM
WITH
YOUR
DOCTRINE
AND
INTEND
TO
BRING
THIS
MAN'S
BLOOD
UPON
US
THEN
PETER
AND
THE
OTHER
APOSTLES
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
WE
OUGHT
TO
OBEY
GOD
RATHER
THAN
MEN
THE
GOD
OF
OUR
FATHERS
RAISED
UP
JESUS
WHOM
YE
SLEW
AND
HANGED
ON
A
TREE
HIM
HATH
GOD
EXALTED
WITH
HIS
RIGHT
HAND
TO
BE
A
PRINCE
AND
A
SAVIOUR
FOR
TO
GIVE
REPENTANCE
TO
ISRAEL
AND
FORGIVENESS
OF
SINS
AND
WE
ARE
HIS
WITNESSES
OF
THESE
THINGS
AND
SO
IS
ALSO
THE
HOLY
GHOST
WHOM
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
TO
THEM
THAT
OBEY
HIM
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
THEY
WERE
CUT
TO
THE
HEART
AND
TOOK
COUNSEL
TO
SLAY
THEM
THEN
STOOD
THERE
UP
ONE
IN
THE
COUNCIL
A
PHARISEE
NAMED
GAMALIEL
A
DOCTOR
OF
THE
LAW
HAD
IN
REPUTATION
AMONG
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
AND
COMMANDED
TO
PUT
THE
APOSTLES
FORTH
A
LITTLE
SPACE
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
TAKE
HEED
TO
YOURSELVES
WHAT
YE
INTEND
TO
DO
AS
TOUCHING
THESE
MEN
FOR
BEFORE
THESE
DAYS
ROSE
UP
THEUDAS
BOASTING
HIMSELF
TO
BE
SOMEBODY
TO
WHOM
A
NUMBER
OF
MEN
ABOUT
FOUR
HUNDRED
JOINED
THEMSELVES
WHO
WAS
SLAIN
AND
ALL
AS
MANY
AS
OBEYED
HIM
WERE
SCATTERED
AND
BROUGHT
TO
NOUGHT
AFTER
THIS
MAN
ROSE
UP
JUDAS
OF
GALILEE
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
TAXING
AND
DREW
AWAY
MUCH
PEOPLE
AFTER
HIM
HE
ALSO
PERISHED
AND
ALL
EVEN
AS
MANY
AS
OBEYED
HIM
WERE
DISPERSED
AND
NOW
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
REFRAIN
FROM
THESE
MEN
AND
LET
THEM
ALONE
FOR
IF
THIS
COUNSEL
OR
THIS
WORK
BE
OF
MEN
IT
WILL
COME
TO
NOUGHT
BUT
IF
IT
BE
OF
GOD
YE
CANNOT
OVERTHROW
IT
LEST
HAPLY
YE
BE
FOUND
EVEN
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
GOD
AND
TO
HIM
THEY
AGREED
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
CALLED
THE
APOSTLES
AND
BEATEN
THEM
THEY
COMMANDED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
SPEAK
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
AND
LET
THEM
GO
AND
THEY
DEPARTED
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
COUNCIL
REJOICING
THAT
THEY
WERE
COUNTED
WORTHY
TO
SUFFER
SHAME
FOR
HIS
NAME
AND
DAILY
IN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
IN
EVERY
HOUSE
THEY
CEASED
NOT
TO
TEACH
AND
PREACH
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
IN
THOSE
DAYS
WHEN
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
WAS
MULTIPLIED
THERE
AROSE
A
MURMURING
OF
THE
GRECIANS
AGAINST
THE
HEBREWS
BECAUSE
THEIR
WIDOWS
WERE
NEGLECTED
IN
THE
DAILY
MINISTRATION
THEN
THE
TWELVE
CALLED
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
UNTO
THEM
AND
SAID
IT
IS
NOT
REASON
THAT
WE
SHOULD
LEAVE
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
SERVE
TABLES
WHEREFORE
BRETHREN
LOOK
YE
OUT
AMONG
YOU
SEVEN
MEN
OF
HONEST
REPORT
FULL
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
WISDOM
WHOM
WE
MAY
APPOINT
OVER
THIS
BUSINESS
BUT
WE
WILL
GIVE
OURSELVES
CONTINUALLY
TO
PRAYER
AND
TO
THE
MINISTRY
OF
THE
WORD
AND
THE
SAYING
PLEASED
THE
WHOLE
MULTITUDE
AND
THEY
CHOSE
STEPHEN
A
MAN
FULL
OF
FAITH
AND
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
PHILIP
AND
PROCHORUS
AND
NICANOR
AND
TIMON
AND
PARMENAS
AND
NICOLAS
A
PROSELYTE
OF
ANTIOCH
WHOM
THEY
SET
BEFORE
THE
APOSTLES
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
PRAYED
THEY
LAID
THEIR
HANDS
ON
THEM
AND
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
INCREASED
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
MULTIPLIED
IN
JERUSALEM
GREATLY
AND
A
GREAT
COMPANY
OF
THE
PRIESTS
WERE
OBEDIENT
TO
THE
FAITH
AND
STEPHEN
FULL
OF
FAITH
AND
POWER
DID
GREAT
WONDERS
AND
MIRACLES
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
THEN
THERE
AROSE
CERTAIN
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
WHICH
IS
CALLED
THE
SYNAGOGUE
OF
THE
LIBERTINES
AND
CYRENIANS
AND
ALEXANDRIANS
AND
OF
THEM
OF
CILICIA
AND
OF
ASIA
DISPUTING
WITH
STEPHEN
AND
THEY
WERE
NOT
ABLE
TO
RESIST
THE
WISDOM
AND
THE
SPIRIT
BY
WHICH
HE
SPAKE
THEN
THEY
SUBORNED
MEN
WHICH
SAID
WE
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
SPEAK
BLASPHEMOUS
WORDS
AGAINST
MOSES
AND
AGAINST
GOD
AND
THEY
STIRRED
UP
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
ELDERS
AND
THE
SCRIBES
AND
CAME
UPON
HIM
AND
CAUGHT
HIM
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
THE
COUNCIL
AND
SET
UP
FALSE
WITNESSES
WHICH
SAID
THIS
MAN
CEASETH
NOT
TO
SPEAK
BLASPHEMOUS
WORDS
AGAINST
THIS
HOLY
PLACE
AND
THE
LAW
FOR
WE
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
SAY
THAT
THIS
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
SHALL
DESTROY
THIS
PLACE
AND
SHALL
CHANGE
THE
CUSTOMS
WHICH
MOSES
DELIVERED
US
AND
ALL
THAT
SAT
IN
THE
COUNCIL
LOOKING
STEDFASTLY
ON
HIM
SAW
HIS
FACE
AS
IT
HAD
BEEN
THE
FACE
OF
AN
ANGEL
THEN
SAID
THE

SO
AND
HE
SAID
MEN
BRETHREN
AND
FATHERS
HEARKEN
THE
GOD
OF
GLORY
APPEARED
UNTO
OUR
FATHER
ABRAHAM
WHEN
HE
WAS
IN

BEFORE
HE
DWELT
IN
CHARRAN
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM

THEE
OUT
OF
THY
COUNTRY
AND
FROM
THY
KINDRED
AND
COME
INTO
THE
LAND
WHICH
I
SHALL
SHEW
THEE
THEN
CAME
HE
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
THE
CHALDAEANS
AND
DWELT
IN
CHARRAN
AND
FROM
THENCE
WHEN
HIS
FATHER
WAS
DEAD
HE
REMOVED
HIM
INTO
THIS
LAND
WHEREIN
YE
NOW
DWELL
AND
HE
GAVE
HIM
NONE
INHERITANCE
IN
IT
NO
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
TO
SET
HIS
FOOT
ON
YET
HE
PROMISED
THAT
HE
WOULD
GIVE
IT
TO
HIM
FOR
A
POSSESSION
AND
TO
HIS
SEED
AFTER
HIM
WHEN
AS
YET
HE
HAD
NO
CHILD
AND
GOD
SPAKE
ON
THIS
WISE
THAT
HIS
SEED
SHOULD
SOJOURN
IN
A
STRANGE
LAND
AND
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BRING
THEM
INTO
BONDAGE
AND
ENTREAT
THEM
EVIL
FOUR
HUNDRED
YEARS
AND
THE
NATION
TO
WHOM
THEY
SHALL
BE
IN

JUDGE
SAID
GOD
AND
AFTER
THAT
SHALL
THEY
COME
FORTH
AND
SERVE
ME
IN
THIS
PLACE
AND
HE
GAVE
HIM
THE
COVENANT
OF
CIRCUMCISION
AND
SO
ABRAHAM
BEGAT
ISAAC
AND
CIRCUMCISED
HIM
THE
EIGHTH
DAY
AND
ISAAC
BEGAT
JACOB
AND
JACOB
BEGAT
THE
TWELVE
PATRIARCHS
AND
THE
PATRIARCHS
MOVED
WITH
ENVY
SOLD
JOSEPH
INTO

BUT
GOD
WAS
WITH
HIM
AND
DELIVERED
HIM
OUT
OF
ALL
HIS
AFFLICTIONS
AND
GAVE
HIM
FAVOUR
AND
WISDOM
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
PHARAOH
KING
OF
EGYPT
AND
HE
MADE
HIM
GOVERNOR
OVER

OVER
ALL
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
AND
CHANAAN
AND
GREAT
AFFLICTION
AND
OUR

FOUND
NO
SUSTENANCE
BUT
WHEN
JACOB
HEARD
THAT
THERE
WAS
CORN
IN

HE
SENT
OUT
OUR
FATHERS
FIRST
AND
AT
THE
SECOND
TIME
JOSEPH
WAS
MADE
KNOWN
TO
HIS
BRETHREN
AND
JOSEPH'S
KINDRED
WAS

THEN
SENT
JOSEPH
AND
CALLED
HIS
FATHER
JACOB
TO
HIM
AND
ALL
HIS
KINDRED
THREESCORE
AND
FIFTEEN
SOULS
SO
JACOB
WENT
DOWN
INTO

AND
DIED
HE
AND
OUR
FATHERS
AND
WERE
CARRIED
OVER
INTO
SYCHEM
AND
LAID

SEPULCHRE
THAT
ABRAHAM
BOUGHT
FOR
A
SUM
OF
MONEY
OF

THE

DEALT
SUBTILLY
WITH
OUR

THEY
MIGHT
NOT

IN
WHICH
TIME
MOSES
WAS
BORN
AND
WAS
EXCEEDING
FAIR
AND
NOURISHED
UP
IN

AND
MOSES
WAS
LEARNED
IN
ALL
THE
WISDOM
OF
THE

AND
WAS
MIGHTY
IN

AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
FULL
FORTY
YEARS
OLD
IT
CAME
INTO
HIS
HEART
TO
VISIT
HIS

THE
CHILDREN
OF

AND
SEEING
ONE
OF

SUFFER
WRONG
HE
DEFENDED

WOULD
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
HOW

BUT
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
NOT

DAY
HE
SHEWED
HIMSELF
UNTO
THEM
AS
THEY
STROVE
AND
WOULD
HAVE
SET

SAYING

AND
RAN
UPON

AND
HE
KNEELED
DOWN
AND
CRIED
WITH
A

TO
THEIR
CHARGE
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
SAID
THIS
HE
FELL
ASLEEP
AND
SAUL
WAS
CONSENTING
UNTO
HIS
DEATH
AND
AT
THAT
TIME
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
PERSECUTION
AGAINST
THE
CHURCH
WHICH
WAS
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
SCATTERED
ABROAD
THROUGHOUT
THE

HAVOCK
OF
THE

ENTERING
INTO
EVERY
HOUSE
AND
HALING

THEREFORE
THEY
THAT
WERE
SCATTERED
ABROAD
WENT
EVERY
WHERE
PREACHING
THE
WORD
THEN
PHILIP
WENT
DOWN
TO
THE
CITY
OF
SAMARIA
AND
PREACHED
CHRIST
UNTO
THEM
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
GAVE
HEED
UNTO
THOSE

WHICH
PHILIP
SPAKE
HEARING

SEEING
THE
MIRACLES
WHICH
HE
DID
FOR
UNCLEAN
SPIRITS
CRYING
WITH
LOUD
VOICE
CAME
OUT
OF

AND
MANY
TAKEN
WITH
PALSIES
AND
THAT
WERE
LAME
WERE
HEALED
AND
THERE
WAS
GREAT
JOY
IN
THAT
CITY
BUT
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
MAN
CALLED
SIMON
WHICH
BEFORETIME
IN
THE
SAME
CITY
USED
SORCERY
AND
BEWITCHED
THE
PEOPLE
OF
SAMARIA
GIVING
OUT
THAT
HIMSELF
WAS
SOME
GREAT

TO
WHOM
THEY
ALL
GAVE
HEED
FROM
THE
LEAST
TO
THE
GREATEST
SAYING
THIS
MAN
IS
THE
GREAT
POWER
OF
GOD
AND
TO
HIM
THEY
HAD
REGARD
BECAUSE
THAT
OF
LONG
TIME
HE
HAD
BEWITCHED
THEM
WITH
SORCERIES
BUT
WHEN
THEY
BELIEVED
PHILIP
PREACHING
THE
THINGS
CONCERNING
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
THEY
WERE
BAPTIZED
BOTH
MEN
AND
WOMEN
THEN
SIMON
HIMSELF
BELIEVED
ALSO
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
BAPTIZED
HE
CONTINUED
WITH
PHILIP
AND
WONDERED
BEHOLDING
THE
MIRACLES
AND
SIGNS
WHICH
WERE
DONE
NOW
WHEN
THE
APOSTLES
WHICH
WERE
AT
JERUSALEM
HEARD
THAT
SAMARIA
HAD
RECEIVED
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
THEY
SENT
UNTO
THEM
PETER
AND
JOHN
WHO
WHEN

DOWN
PRAYED
FOR
THEM
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE

FOR
AS
YET
HE
WAS
FALLEN
UPON
NONE
OF
THEM
ONLY
THEY
WERE
BAPTIZED
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE

JESUS
THEN
LAID
THEY
THEIR
HANDS
ON
THEM
AND
THEY
RECEIVED
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
WHEN
SIMON
SAW
THAT
THROUGH
LAYING
ON
OF
THE
APOSTLES'
HANDS
THE
HOLY
GHOST
WAS
GIVEN
HE
OFFERED
THEM
MONEY
SAYING
GIVE
ME
ALSO
THIS
POWER
THAT
ON
WHOMSOEVER
I
LAY
HANDS
HE
MAY
RECEIVE
THE
HOLY
GHOST
BUT
PETER
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THY
MONEY
PERISH
WITH
THEE
BECAUSE
THOU
HAST
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
MAY
BE
PURCHASED
WITH
MONEY
THOU
HAST
NEITHER
PART
NOR
LOT
IN
THIS
MATTER
FOR
THY
HEART
IS
NOT
RIGHT
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD
REPENT
THEREFORE
OF
THIS
THY
WICKEDNESS
AND
PRAY
GOD
IF
PERHAPS
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THINE
HEART
MAY
BE
FORGIVEN
THEE
FOR
I
PERCEIVE
THAT
THOU
ART
IN
THE
GALL
OF
BITTERNESS
AND
IN
THE
BOND
OF
INIQUITY
THEN
ANSWERED
SIMON
AND
SAID
PRAY

TO
THE
LORD
FOR
ME
THAT
NONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
WHICH
YE
HAVE
SPOKEN
COME

HE
DESIRED
PHILIP
THAT

WOULD
COME
UP
AND
SIT
WITH
HIM
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
SCRIPTURE
WHICH
HE
READ
WAS

HE
WAS
LED
AS
A

AND
LIKE

SO
OPENED
HE
NOT

SCRIPTURE
AND
PREACHED
UNTO

AND
HE
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
I
BELIEVE
THAT

HE
COMMANDED
THE

REJOICING
BUT

DECLARED
UNTO
THEM
HOW

I
PERCEIVE
THAT
GOD
IS
NO
RESPECTER
OF

BUT
IN

LORD
OF
ALL
THAT
WORD
I
SAY
YE
KNOW
WHICH
WAS
PUBLISHED
THROUGHOUT
ALL
JUDAEA
AND
BEGAN
FROM

AFTER
THE
BAPTISM
WHICH
JOHN
PREACHED
HOW
GOD
ANOINTED
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
WITH
POWER
WHO
WENT
ABOUT
DOING
GOOD
AND
HEALING
ALL
THAT
WERE
OPPRESSED
OF
THE
DEVIL
FOR
GOD
WAS
WITH
HIM
AND
WE
ARE
WITNESSES
OF
ALL
THINGS
WHICH
HE
DID
BOTH
IN
THE
LAND
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
IN
JERUSALEM
WHOM
THEY
SLEW
AND
HANGED
ON
A
TREE
HIM
GOD
RAISED
UP
THE
THIRD
DAY
AND
SHEWED
HIM
OPENLY
NOT
TO
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
BUT
UNTO
WITNESSES
CHOSEN
BEFORE
GOD
EVEN
TO
US
WHO
DID
EAT
AND
DRINK
WITH
HIM
AFTER
HE
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
HE
COMMANDED
US
TO
PREACH
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
TO
TESTIFY
THAT
IT
IS
HE
WHICH
WAS
ORDAINED
OF
GOD
TO
BE
THE
JUDGE
OF
QUICK

DEAD
TO
HIM
GIVE
ALL
THE
PROPHETS
WITNESS
THAT
THROUGH
HIS
NAME
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
IN

SHALL
RECEIVE
REMISSION
OF
SINS
WHILE
PETER
YET
SPAKE
THESE
WORDS
THE
HOLY
GHOST
FELL
ON
ALL
THEM
WHICH
HEARD
THE
WORD
AND
THEY
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
WHICH
BELIEVED
WERE
ASTONISHED
AS
MANY
AS
CAME
WITH
PETER
BECAUSE
THAT
ON
THE
GENTILES
ALSO
WAS
POURED
OUT
THE
GIFT
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
FOR
THEY
HEARD
THEM
SPEAK
WITH
TONGUES
AND
MAGNIFY
GOD
THEN
ANSWERED
PETER
CAN
ANY
MAN
FORBID
WATER
THAT
THESE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
BAPTIZED
WHICH
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AS
WELL
AS
WE
AND
HE
COMMANDED
THEM
TO
BE
BAPTIZED
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE

THE
APOSTLES
AND
BRETHREN
THAT
WERE

HEARD
THAT

SAYING
THOU
WENTEST
IN

UNCIRCUMCISED
AND

BUT
PETER
REHEARSED
THE
MATTER
FROM

BEGINNING
AND
EXPOUNDED
IT
BY
ORDER
UNTO
THEM
SAYING
I
WAS
IN
THE

LORD
FOR
NOTHING
COMMON

HATH
AT
ANY

BUT
THE

AND
THIS
WAS
DONE
THREE
TIMES
AND

AND
BEHOLD
IMMEDIATELY
THERE
WERE
THREE

SAVED
AND
AS

BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
THE

I
THAT
I
COULD
WITHSTAND
GOD
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THESE

THEY
HELD
THEIR

AND
GLORIFIED
GOD
SAYING
THEN
HATH

THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
WAS
GLAD
AND
EXHORTED
THEM
ALL
THAT
WITH
PURPOSE
OF
HEART
THEY
WOULD
CLEAVE
UNTO
THE
LORD
FOR
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
MAN
AND
FULL
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
OF
FAITH
AND
MUCH
PEOPLE
WAS
ADDED
UNTO
THE
LORD
THEN
DEPARTED
BARNABAS
TO
TARSUS
FOR
TO
SEEK
SAUL
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
FOUND
HIM
HE
BROUGHT
HIM
UNTO
ANTIOCH
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
A
WHOLE
YEAR
THEY
ASSEMBLED
THEMSELVES
WITH
THE
CHURCH
AND
TAUGHT
MUCH
PEOPLE
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
WERE
CALLED
CHRISTIANS
FIRST
IN
ANTIOCH
AND
IN
THESE
DAYS
CAME
PROPHETS
FROM
JERUSALEM
UNTO
ANTIOCH
AND
THERE
STOOD
UP
ONE
OF
THEM
NAMED
AGABUS
AND
SIGNIFIED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
GREAT
DEARTH
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
WORLD
WHICH
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
CLAUDIUS
CAESAR
THEN
THE
DISCIPLES
EVERY
MAN
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
ABILITY
DETERMINED
TO
SEND
RELIEF
UNTO
THE
BRETHREN
WHICH
DWELT
IN
JUDAEA
WHICH
ALSO
THEY
DID
AND
SENT
IT
TO
THE
ELDERS
BY
THE
HANDS
OF
BARNABAS
AND
SAUL
NOW
ABOUT
THAT
TIME
HEROD
THE
KING
STRETCHED
FORTH
HIS
HANDS
TO
VEX
CERTAIN
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
HE
KILLED
JAMES
THE
BROTHER
OF
JOHN
WITH
THE
SWORD
AND
BECAUSE
HE
SAW
IT
PLEASED
THE
JEWS
HE
PROCEEDED
FURTHER
TO
TAKE
PETER
ALSO
THEN
WERE
THE
DAYS
OF
UNLEAVENED
BREAD
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
APPREHENDED
HIM
HE
PUT
HIM
IN
PRISON
AND
DELIVERED
HIM
TO
FOUR
QUATERNIONS
OF
SOLDIERS
TO
KEEP
HIM
INTENDING
AFTER
EASTER
TO
BRING
HIM
FORTH
TO
THE
PEOPLE
PETER
THEREFORE
WAS
KEPT
IN
PRISON
BUT
PRAYER
WAS
MADE
WITHOUT
CEASING
OF
THE
CHURCH
UNTO
GOD
FOR
HIM
AND
WHEN
HEROD
WOULD
HAVE
BROUGHT
HIM
FORTH
THE
SAME
NIGHT
PETER
WAS
SLEEPING
BETWEEN
TWO
SOLDIERS
BOUND
WITH
TWO
CHAINS
AND
THE
KEEPERS
BEFORE
THE
DOOR
KEPT
THE
PRISON
AND
BEHOLD
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
CAME
UPON
HIM
AND
A
LIGHT
SHINED
IN
THE
PRISON
AND
HE
SMOTE
PETER
ON
THE
SIDE
AND
RAISED
HIM
UP
SAYING
ARISE
UP
QUICKLY
AND
HIS
CHAINS
FELL
OFF
FROM
HIS
HANDS
AND
THE
ANGEL
SAID
UNTO
HIM
GIRD
THYSELF
AND
BIND
ON
THY
SANDALS
AND
SO
HE
DID
AND
HE
SAITH
UNTO
HIM
CAST
THY
GARMENT
ABOUT
THEE
AND
FOLLOW
ME
AND
HE
WENT
OUT
AND
FOLLOWED
HIM
AND
WIST
NOT
THAT
IT
WAS
TRUE
WHICH
WAS
DONE
BY
THE
ANGEL
BUT
THOUGHT
HE
SAW
A
VISION
WHEN
THEY
WERE
PAST
THE
FIRST
AND
THE
SECOND
WARD
THEY
CAME
UNTO
THE
IRON
GATE
THAT
LEADETH
UNTO
THE
CITY
WHICH
OPENED
TO
THEM
OF
HIS
OWN
ACCORD
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
AND
PASSED
ON
THROUGH
ONE
STREET
AND
FORTHWITH
THE
ANGEL
DEPARTED
FROM
HIM
AND
WHEN
PETER
WAS
COME
TO
HIMSELF
HE
SAID
NOW
I
KNOW
OF
A
SURETY
THAT
THE
LORD
HATH
SENT
HIS
ANGEL
AND
HATH
DELIVERED
ME
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF
HEROD
AND
FROM
ALL
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
CONSIDERED
THE
THING
HE
CAME
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
MARY
THE
MOTHER
OF
JOHN
WHOSE
SURNAME
WAS
MARK
WHERE
MANY
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
PRAYING
AND
AS
PETER
KNOCKED
AT
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
GATE
A
DAMSEL
CAME
TO
HEARKEN
NAMED
RHODA
AND
WHEN
SHE
KNEW
PETER'S
VOICE
SHE
OPENED
NOT
THE
GATE
FOR
GLADNESS
BUT
RAN
IN
AND
TOLD
HOW
PETER
STOOD
BEFORE
THE
GATE
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HER
THOU
ART
MAD
BUT
SHE
CONSTANTLY
AFFIRMED
THAT
IT
WAS
EVEN
SO
THEN
SAID
THEY
IT
IS
HIS
ANGEL
BUT
PETER
CONTINUED
KNOCKING
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
OPENED
THE
DOOR
AND
SAW
HIM
THEY
WERE
ASTONISHED
BUT
HE
BECKONING
UNTO
THEM
WITH
THE
HAND
TO
HOLD
THEIR
PEACE
DECLARED
UNTO
THEM
HOW
THE
LORD
HAD
BROUGHT
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
PRISON
AND
HE
SAID
GO
SHEW
THESE
THINGS
UNTO
JAMES
AND
TO
THE
BRETHREN
AND
HE
DEPARTED
AND
WENT
INTO
ANOTHER
PLACE
NOW
AS
SOON
AS
IT
WAS
DAY
THERE
WAS
NO
SMALL
STIR
AMONG
THE
SOLDIERS
WHAT
WAS
BECOME
OF
PETER
AND
WHEN
HEROD
HAD
SOUGHT
FOR
HIM
AND
FOUND
HIM
NOT
HE
EXAMINED
THE
KEEPERS
AND
COMMANDED
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
PUT
TO
DEATH
AND
HE
WENT
DOWN
FROM
JUDAEA
TO
CAESAREA
AND
THERE
ABODE
AND
HEROD
WAS
HIGHLY
DISPLEASED
WITH
THEM
OF
TYRE
AND
SIDON
BUT
THEY
CAME
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
TO
HIM
AND
HAVING
MADE
BLASTUS
THE
KING'S
CHAMBERLAIN
THEIR
FRIEND
DESIRED
PEACE
BECAUSE
THEIR
COUNTRY
WAS
NOURISHED
BY
THE
KING'S
COUNTRY
AND
UPON
A
SET
DAY
HEROD
ARRAYED
IN
ROYAL
APPAREL
SAT
UPON
HIS
THRONE
AND
MADE
AN
ORATION
UNTO
THEM
AND
THE
PEOPLE
GAVE
A
SHOUT
SAYING
IT
IS
THE
VOICE
OF
A
GOD
AND
NOT
OF
A
MAN
AND
IMMEDIATELY
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
LORD
SMOTE
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
GAVE
NOT
GOD
THE
GLORY
AND
HE
WAS
EATEN
OF
WORMS
AND
GAVE
UP
THE
GHOST
BUT
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
GREW
AND
MULTIPLIED
AND
BARNABAS
AND
SAUL
RETURNED
FROM
JERUSALEM
WHEN
THEY
HAD
FULFILLED

SAID
SEPARATE
ME

FOR
THE
WORK
WHEREUNTO

HAVE
CALLED
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
FASTED
AND
PRAYED
AND
LAID
THEIR
HANDS
ON
THEM
THEY
SENT
THEM
AWAY
SO
THEY
BEING
SENT
FORTH
BY
THE
HOLY
GHOST
DEPARTED
UNTO
SELEUCIA
AND
FROM
THENCE
THEY
SAILED
TO
CYPRUS
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
AT
SALAMIS
THEY
PREACHED
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUES
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
THEY
HAD
ALSO
JOHN

AND
WHEN

FOR

IS
HIS
NAME
BY
INTERPRETATION
WITHSTOOD
THEM
SEEKING
TO

THEN
SAUL
WHO
ALSO
IS
CALLED

FILLED
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
SET
HIS
EYES
ON
HIM
AND
SAID
O
FULL
OF
ALL
SUBTILTY
AND
ALL
MISCHIEF

CHILD
OF
THE
DEVIL
THOU
ENEMY
OF
ALL
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WILT

HAND
OF
THE
LORD
IS
UPON
THEE
AND
THOU
SHALT
BE
BLIND
NOT
SEEING
THE
SUN
FOR
A
SEASON
AND
IMMEDIATELY
THERE
FELL
ON
HIM
A
MIST
AND
A
DARKNESS
AND
HE
WENT
ABOUT
SEEKING
SOME
TO
LEAD
HIM
BY
THE
HAND
THEN
THE
DEPUTY
WHEN
HE
SAW
WHAT

DONE
BELIEVED
BEING
ASTONISHED
AT

LORD
NOW
WHEN
PAUL
AND
HIS
COMPANY
LOOSED
FROM
PAPHOS
THEY
CAME
TO
PERGA
IN
PAMPHYLIA
AND
JOHN
DEPARTING
FROM

BUT
WHEN
THEY
DEPARTED
FROM

THEY
CAME
TO
ANTIOCH
IN
PISIDIA
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
ON
THE
SABBATH
DAY
AND

DOWN
AND
AFTER
THE
READING
OF
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
THE
RULERS
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
SENT
UNTO
THEM
SAYING
YE
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
IF
YE
HAVE
ANY
WORD
OF
EXHORTATION
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
SAY
ON
THEN
PAUL
STOOD
UP
AND
BECKONING
WITH
HIS
HAND
SAID
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
AND
YE
THAT
FEAR
GOD
GIVE
AUDIENCE
THE
GOD
OF
THIS
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
CHOSE
OUR
FATHERS
AND
EXALTED
THE
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
DWELT
AS
STRANGERS
IN
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
AND
WITH
AN
HIGH
ARM
BROUGHT
HE
THEM
OUT
OF
IT
AND
ABOUT
THE
TIME
OF
FORTY
YEARS
SUFFERED
HE
THEIR
MANNERS
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
DESTROYED
SEVEN
NATIONS
IN
THE
LAND
OF
CHANAAN
HE
DIVIDED
THEIR
LAND
TO
THEM
BY
LOT
AND
AFTER
THAT
HE
GAVE
UNTO
THEM
JUDGES
ABOUT
THE
SPACE
OF
FOUR
HUNDRED
AND
FIFTY
YEARS
UNTIL
SAMUEL
THE
PROPHET
AND
AFTERWARD
THEY
DESIRED
A
KING
AND
GOD
GAVE
UNTO
THEM
SAUL
THE
SON
OF
CIS
A
MAN
OF
THE
TRIBE
OF
BENJAMIN
BY
THE
SPACE
OF
FORTY
YEARS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
REMOVED
HIM
HE
RAISED
UP
UNTO
THEM
DAVID
TO
BE
THEIR
KING
TO
WHOM
ALSO
HE
GAVE
THEIR
TESTIMONY
AND
SAID
I
HAVE
FOUND
DAVID
THE
SON
OF
JESSE
A
MAN
AFTER
MINE
OWN
HEART
WHICH
SHALL
FULFIL
ALL
MY
WILL
OF
THIS
MAN'S
SEED
HATH
GOD
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
PROMISE
RAISED
UNTO
ISRAEL
A
SAVIOUR
JESUS
WHEN
JOHN
HAD
FIRST
PREACHED
BEFORE
HIS
COMING
THE
BAPTISM
OF
REPENTANCE
TO
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
AND
AS
JOHN
FULFILLED
HIS
COURSE
HE
SAID
WHOM
THINK
YE
THAT
I
AM
I
AM
NOT
HE
BUT
BEHOLD
THERE
COMETH
ONE
AFTER
ME
WHOSE
SHOES
OF
HIS
FEET
I
AM
NOT
WORTHY
TO
LOOSE
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
CHILDREN
OF
THE
STOCK
OF
ABRAHAM
AND
WHOSOEVER
AMONG
YOU
FEARETH
GOD
TO
YOU
IS
THE
WORD
OF
THIS
SALVATION
SENT
FOR
THEY
THAT
DWELL
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
THEIR
RULERS
BECAUSE
THEY
KNEW
HIM
NOT
NOR
YET
THE
VOICES
OF
THE
PROPHETS
WHICH
ARE
READ
EVERY
SABBATH
DAY
THEY
HAVE
FULFILLED
THEM
IN
CONDEMNING
HIM
AND
THOUGH
THEY
FOUND
NO
CAUSE
OF
DEATH
IN
HIM
YET
DESIRED
THEY
PILATE
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
SLAIN
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
FULFILLED
ALL
THAT
WAS
WRITTEN
OF
HIM
THEY
TOOK
HIM
DOWN
FROM
THE
TREE
AND
LAID
HIM
IN
A
SEPULCHRE
BUT
GOD
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
HE
WAS
SEEN
MANY
DAYS
OF
THEM
WHICH
CAME
UP
WITH
HIM
FROM
GALILEE
TO
JERUSALEM
WHO
ARE
HIS
WITNESSES
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WE
DECLARE
UNTO
YOU
GLAD
TIDINGS
HOW
THAT
THE
PROMISE
WHICH
WAS
MADE
UNTO
THE
FATHERS
GOD
HATH
FULFILLED
THE
SAME
UNTO
US
THEIR
CHILDREN
IN
THAT
HE
HATH
RAISED
UP
JESUS
AGAIN
AS
IT
IS
ALSO
WRITTEN
IN
THE
SECOND
PSALM
THOU
ART
MY
SON
THIS
DAY
HAVE
I
BEGOTTEN
THEE
AND
AS
CONCERNING
THAT
HE
RAISED
HIM
UP
FROM
THE
DEAD
NOW
NO
MORE
TO
RETURN
TO
CORRUPTION
HE
SAID
ON
THIS
WISE
I
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
SURE
MERCIES
OF
DAVID
WHEREFORE
HE
SAITH
ALSO
IN
ANOTHER
PSALM
THOU
SHALT
NOT
SUFFER
THINE
HOLY
ONE
TO
SEE
CORRUPTION
FOR
DAVID
AFTER
HE
HAD
SERVED
HIS
OWN
GENERATION
BY
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
FELL
ON
SLEEP
AND
WAS
LAID
UNTO
HIS
FATHERS
AND
SAW
CORRUPTION
BUT
HE
WHOM
GOD
RAISED
AGAIN
SAW
NO
CORRUPTION
BE
IT
KNOWN
UNTO
YOU
THEREFORE
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
THAT
THROUGH
THIS
MAN
IS
PREACHED
UNTO
YOU
THE
FORGIVENESS
OF
SINS
AND
BY
HIM
ALL
THAT
BELIEVE
ARE
JUSTIFIED
FROM
ALL
THINGS
FROM
WHICH
YE
COULD
NOT
BE
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
BEWARE
THEREFORE
LEST
THAT
COME
UPON
YOU
WHICH
IS
SPOKEN
OF
IN
THE
PROPHETS
BEHOLD
YE
DESPISERS
AND
WONDER
AND
PERISH
FOR
I
WORK
A
WORK
IN
YOUR
DAYS
A
WORK
WHICH
YE
SHALL
IN
NO
WISE
BELIEVE
THOUGH
A
MAN
DECLARE
IT
UNTO
YOU
AND
WHEN
THE
JEWS
WERE
GONE
OUT
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
THE
GENTILES
BESOUGHT
THAT
THESE
WORDS
MIGHT
BE
PREACHED
TO
THEM
THE
NEXT
SABBATH
NOW
WHEN
THE
CONGREGATION
WAS
BROKEN
UP
MANY
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
RELIGIOUS
PROSELYTES
FOLLOWED
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
WHO
SPEAKING
TO
THEM
PERSUADED
THEM
TO
CONTINUE
IN
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
NEXT
SABBATH
DAY
CAME
ALMOST
THE
WHOLE
CITY
TOGETHER
TO
HEAR
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
BUT
WHEN
THE
JEWS
SAW
THE
MULTITUDES
THEY
WERE
FILLED
WITH
ENVY
AND
SPAKE
AGAINST
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
BY
PAUL
CONTRADICTING
AND
BLASPHEMING
THEN
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
WAXED
BOLD
AND
SAID
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
THAT
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
SHOULD
FIRST
HAVE
BEEN
SPOKEN
TO
YOU
BUT
SEEING
YE
PUT
IT
FROM
YOU
AND
JUDGE
YOURSELVES
UNWORTHY
OF
EVERLASTING
LIFE
LO
WE
TURN
TO
THE
GENTILES
FOR
SO
HATH
THE
LORD
COMMANDED
US
SAYING
I
HAVE
SET
THEE
TO
BE
A
LIGHT
OF
THE
GENTILES
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
BE
FOR
SALVATION
UNTO
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
WHEN
THE
GENTILES
HEARD
THIS
THEY
WERE
GLAD
AND
GLORIFIED
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
AND
AS
MANY
AS
WERE
ORDAINED
TO
ETERNAL
LIFE
BELIEVED
AND
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
PUBLISHED
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
REGION
BUT
THE
JEWS
STIRRED
UP
THE
DEVOUT
AND
HONOURABLE
WOMEN
AND
THE
CHIEF
MEN
OF
THE
CITY
AND
RAISED
PERSECUTION
AGAINST
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
AND
EXPELLED
THEM
OUT
OF
THEIR
COASTS
BUT
THEY
SHOOK
OFF
THE
DUST
OF
THEIR
FEET
AGAINST
THEM
AND
CAME
UNTO
ICONIUM
AND
THE
DISCIPLES
WERE
FILLED
WITH
JOY
AND
WITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
ICONIUM
THAT
THEY
WENT
BOTH
TOGETHER
INTO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
SO
SPAKE
THAT
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
BOTH
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
ALSO
OF
THE
GREEKS
BELIEVED
BUT
THE
UNBELIEVING
JEWS
STIRRED
UP
THE
GENTILES
AND
MADE
THEIR
MINDS
EVIL
AFFECTED
AGAINST
THE
BRETHREN
LONG
TIME
THEREFORE
ABODE
THEY
SPEAKING
BOLDLY
IN
THE
LORD
WHICH
GAVE
TESTIMONY
UNTO
THE
WORD
OF
HIS
GRACE
AND
GRANTED
SIGNS
AND
WONDERS
TO
BE
DONE
BY
THEIR
HANDS
BUT
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
CITY
WAS
DIVIDED
AND
PART
HELD
WITH
THE
JEWS
AND
PART
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
AND
WHEN
THERE
WAS
AN
ASSAULT
MADE
BOTH
OF
THE
GENTILES
AND
ALSO
OF
THE
JEWS
WITH
THEIR
RULERS
TO
USE
THEM
DESPITEFULLY
AND
TO
STONE
THEM
THEY
WERE
WARE
OF
IT
AND
FLED
UNTO
LYSTRA
AND
DERBE
CITIES
OF
LYCAONIA
AND
UNTO
THE
REGION
THAT
LIETH
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
THERE
THEY
PREACHED
THE
GOSPEL
AND
THERE
SAT
A
CERTAIN
MAN
AT
LYSTRA
IMPOTENT
IN
HIS
FEET
BEING
A
CRIPPLE
FROM
HIS
MOTHER'S
WOMB
WHO
NEVER
HAD
WALKED
THE
SAME
HEARD
PAUL
SPEAK
WHO
STEDFASTLY
BEHOLDING
HIM
AND
PERCEIVING
THAT
HE
HAD
FAITH
TO
BE
HEALED
SAID
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
STAND
UPRIGHT
ON
THY
FEET
AND
HE
LEAPED
AND
WALKED
AND
WHEN
THE
PEOPLE
SAW
WHAT
PAUL
HAD
DONE
THEY
LIFTED
UP
THEIR
VOICES
SAYING
IN
THE
SPEECH
OF
LYCAONIA
THE
GODS
ARE
COME
DOWN
TO
US
IN
THE
LIKENESS
OF
MEN
AND
THEY
CALLED
BARNABAS
JUPITER
AND
PAUL
MERCURIUS
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
THE
CHIEF
SPEAKER
THEN
THE
PRIEST
OF
JUPITER
WHICH
WAS
BEFORE
THEIR
CITY
BROUGHT
OXEN
AND
GARLANDS
UNTO
THE
GATES
AND
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
SACRIFICE
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
WHICH
WHEN
THE
APOSTLES
BARNABAS
AND
PAUL
HEARD
OF
THEY
RENT
THEIR
CLOTHES
AND
RAN
IN
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
CRYING
OUT
AND
SAYING
SIRS
WHY
DO
YE
THESE
THINGS
WE
ALSO
ARE
MEN
OF
LIKE
PASSIONS
WITH
YOU
AND
PREACH
UNTO
YOU
THAT
YE
SHOULD
TURN
FROM
THESE
VANITIES
UNTO
THE
LIVING
GOD
WHICH
MADE
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
AND
THE
SEA
AND
ALL
THINGS
THAT
ARE
THEREIN
WHO
IN
TIMES
PAST
SUFFERED
ALL
NATIONS
TO
WALK
IN
THEIR
OWN
WAYS
NEVERTHELESS
HE
LEFT
NOT
HIMSELF
WITHOUT
WITNESS
IN
THAT
HE
DID
GOOD
AND
GAVE
US
RAIN
FROM
HEAVEN
AND
FRUITFUL
SEASONS
FILLING
OUR
HEARTS
WITH
FOOD
AND
GLADNESS
AND
WITH
THESE
SAYINGS
SCARCE
RESTRAINED
THEY
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
HAD
NOT
DONE
SACRIFICE
UNTO
THEM
AND
THERE
CAME
THITHER
CERTAIN
JEWS
FROM
ANTIOCH
AND
ICONIUM
WHO
PERSUADED
THE
PEOPLE
AND
HAVING
STONED
PAUL
DREW
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
SUPPOSING
HE
HAD
BEEN
DEAD
HOWBEIT
AS
THE
DISCIPLES
STOOD
ROUND
ABOUT
HIM
HE
ROSE
UP
AND
CAME
INTO
THE
CITY
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
HE
DEPARTED
WITH
BARNABAS
TO
DERBE
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
PREACHED
THE
GOSPEL
TO
THAT
CITY
AND
HAD
TAUGHT
MANY
THEY
RETURNED
AGAIN
TO
LYSTRA
AND
TO
ICONIUM
AND
ANTIOCH
CONFIRMING
THE
SOULS
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
EXHORTING
THEM
TO
CONTINUE
IN
THE
FAITH
AND
THAT
WE
MUST
THROUGH
MUCH
TRIBULATION
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
ORDAINED
THEM
ELDERS
IN
EVERY
CHURCH
AND
HAD
PRAYED
WITH
FASTING
THEY
COMMENDED
THEM
TO
THE
LORD
ON
WHOM
THEY
BELIEVED
AND
AFTER
THEY
HAD
PASSED
THROUGHOUT
PISIDIA
THEY
CAME
TO
PAMPHYLIA
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
PREACHED
THE
WORD
IN
PERGA
THEY
WENT
DOWN
INTO
ATTALIA
AND
THENCE
SAILED
TO
ANTIOCH
FROM
WHENCE
THEY
HAD
BEEN
RECOMMENDED
TO
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
FOR
THE
WORK
WHICH
THEY
FULFILLED
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
AND
HAD
GATHERED
THE
CHURCH
TOGETHER
THEY
REHEARSED
ALL
THAT
GOD
HAD
DONE
WITH
THEM
AND
HOW
HE
HAD
OPENED
THE
DOOR
OF
FAITH
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
THERE
THEY
ABODE
LONG
TIME
WITH
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
CERTAIN
MEN
WHICH
CAME
DOWN
FROM
JUDAEA
TAUGHT
THE
BRETHREN
AND
SAID
EXCEPT
YE
BE
CIRCUMCISED
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
MOSES
YE
CANNOT
BE
SAVED
WHEN
THEREFORE
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
HAD
NO
SMALL
DISSENSION
AND
DISPUTATION
WITH
THEM
THEY
DETERMINED
THAT
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
AND
CERTAIN
OTHER
OF
THEM
SHOULD
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
UNTO
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
ABOUT
THIS
QUESTION
AND
BEING
BROUGHT
ON
THEIR
WAY
BY
THE
CHURCH
THEY
PASSED
THROUGH
PHENICE
AND
SAMARIA
DECLARING
THE
CONVERSION
OF
THE
GENTILES
AND
THEY
CAUSED
GREAT
JOY
UNTO
ALL
THE
BRETHREN
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
TO
JERUSALEM
THEY
WERE
RECEIVED
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
OF
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
AND
THEY
DECLARED
ALL
THINGS
THAT
GOD
HAD
DONE
WITH
THEM
BUT
THERE
ROSE
UP
CERTAIN
OF
THE
SECT
OF
THE
PHARISEES
WHICH
BELIEVED
SAYING
THAT
IT
WAS
NEEDFUL
TO
CIRCUMCISE
THEM
AND
TO
COMMAND
THEM
TO
KEEP
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
AND
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
CAME
TOGETHER
FOR
TO
CONSIDER
OF
THIS
MATTER
AND
WHEN
THERE
HAD
BEEN
MUCH
DISPUTING
PETER
ROSE
UP
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
YE
KNOW
HOW
THAT
A
GOOD
WHILE
AGO
GOD
MADE
CHOICE
AMONG
US
THAT
THE
GENTILES
BY
MY
MOUTH
SHOULD
HEAR
THE
WORD
OF
THE
GOSPEL
AND
BELIEVE
AND
GOD
WHICH
KNOWETH
THE
HEARTS
BARE
THEM
WITNESS
GIVING
THEM
THE
HOLY
GHOST
EVEN
AS
HE
DID
UNTO
US
AND
PUT
NO
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
US
AND
THEM
PURIFYING
THEIR
HEARTS
BY
FAITH
NOW
THEREFORE
WHY
TEMPT
YE
GOD
TO
PUT
A
YOKE
UPON
THE
NECK
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
WHICH
NEITHER
OUR
FATHERS
NOR
WE
WERE
ABLE
TO
BEAR
BUT
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THROUGH
THE
GRACE
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
WE
SHALL
BE
SAVED
EVEN
AS
THEY
THEN
ALL
THE
MULTITUDE
KEPT
SILENCE
AND
GAVE
AUDIENCE
TO
BARNABAS
AND
PAUL
DECLARING
WHAT
MIRACLES
AND
WONDERS
GOD
HAD
WROUGHT
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
BY
THEM
AND
AFTER
THEY
HAD
HELD
THEIR
PEACE
JAMES
ANSWERED
SAYING
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
HEARKEN
UNTO
ME
SIMEON
HATH
DECLARED
HOW
GOD
AT
THE
FIRST
DID
VISIT
THE
GENTILES
TO
TAKE
OUT
OF
THEM
A
PEOPLE
FOR
HIS
NAME
AND
TO
THIS
AGREE
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
PROPHETS
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
AFTER
THIS
I
WILL
RETURN
AND
WILL
BUILD
AGAIN
THE
TABERNACLE
OF
DAVID
WHICH
IS
FALLEN
DOWN
AND
I
WILL
BUILD
AGAIN
THE
RUINS
THEREOF
AND
I
WILL
SET
IT
UP
THAT
THE
RESIDUE
OF
MEN
MIGHT
SEEK
AFTER
THE
LORD
AND
ALL
THE
GENTILES
UPON
WHOM
MY
NAME
IS
CALLED
SAITH
THE
LORD
WHO
DOETH
ALL
THESE
THINGS
KNOWN
UNTO
GOD
ARE
ALL
HIS
WORKS
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
WORLD
WHEREFORE
MY
SENTENCE
IS
THAT
WE
TROUBLE
NOT
THEM
WHICH
FROM
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
ARE
TURNED
TO
GOD
BUT
THAT
WE
WRITE
UNTO
THEM
THAT
THEY
ABSTAIN
FROM
POLLUTIONS
OF
IDOLS
AND
FROM
FORNICATION
AND
FROM
THINGS
STRANGLED
AND
FROM
BLOOD
FOR
MOSES
OF
OLD
TIME
HATH
IN
EVERY
CITY
THEM
THAT
PREACH
HIM
BEING
READ
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUES
EVERY
SABBATH
DAY
THEN
PLEASED
IT
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
WITH
THE
WHOLE
CHURCH
TO
SEND
CHOSEN
MEN
OF
THEIR
OWN
COMPANY
TO
ANTIOCH
WITH
PAUL
AND
BARNABAS
NAMELY
JUDAS
SURNAMED
BARSABAS
AND
SILAS
CHIEF
MEN
AMONG
THE
BRETHREN
AND
THEY
WROTE
LETTERS
BY
THEM
AFTER
THIS
MANNER
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
AND
BRETHREN
SEND
GREETING
UNTO
THE
BRETHREN
WHICH
ARE
OF
THE
GENTILES
IN
ANTIOCH
AND
SYRIA
AND
CILICIA
FORASMUCH
AS
WE
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
CERTAIN
WHICH
WENT
OUT
FROM
US
HAVE
TROUBLED
YOU
WITH
WORDS
SUBVERTING
YOUR
SOULS
SAYING
YE
MUST
BE
CIRCUMCISED
AND
KEEP
THE
LAW
TO
WHOM
WE
GAVE
NO
SUCH
COMMANDMENT
IT
SEEMED
GOOD
UNTO
US
BEING
ASSEMBLED
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
TO
SEND
CHOSEN
MEN
UNTO
YOU
WITH
OUR
BELOVED
BARNABAS
AND
PAUL
MEN
THAT
HAVE
HAZARDED
THEIR
LIVES
FOR
THE
NAME
OF
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
WE
HAVE
SENT
THEREFORE
JUDAS
AND
SILAS
WHO
SHALL
ALSO
TELL
YOU
THE
SAME
THINGS
BY
MOUTH
FOR
IT
SEEMED
GOOD
TO
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
TO
US
TO
LAY
UPON
YOU
NO
GREATER
BURDEN
THAN
THESE
NECESSARY
THINGS
THAT
YE
ABSTAIN
FROM
MEATS
OFFERED
TO
IDOLS
AND
FROM
BLOOD
AND
FROM
THINGS
STRANGLED
AND
FROM
FORNICATION
FROM
WHICH
IF
YE
KEEP
YOURSELVES
YE
SHALL
DO
WELL
FARE
YE
WELL
SO
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DISMISSED
THEY
CAME
TO
ANTIOCH
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
GATHERED
THE
MULTITUDE
TOGETHER
THEY
DELIVERED
THE
EPISTLE
WHICH
WHEN
THEY
HAD
READ
THEY
REJOICED
FOR
THE
CONSOLATION
AND
JUDAS
AND
SILAS
BEING
PROPHETS
ALSO
THEMSELVES
EXHORTED
THE
BRETHREN
WITH
MANY
WORDS
AND
CONFIRMED
THEM
AND
AFTER
THEY
HAD
TARRIED
THERE
A
SPACE
THEY
WERE
LET
GO
IN
PEACE
FROM
THE
BRETHREN
UNTO
THE
APOSTLES
NOTWITHSTANDING
IT
PLEASED
SILAS
TO
ABIDE
THERE
STILL
PAUL
ALSO
AND
BARNABAS
CONTINUED
IN
ANTIOCH
TEACHING
AND
PREACHING
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
WITH
MANY
OTHERS
ALSO
AND
SOME
DAYS
AFTER
PAUL
SAID
UNTO
BARNABAS
LET
US
GO
AGAIN
AND
VISIT
OUR
BRETHREN
IN
EVERY
CITY
WHERE
WE
HAVE
PREACHED
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
AND
SEE
HOW
THEY
DO
AND
BARNABAS
DETERMINED
TO
TAKE
WITH
THEM
JOHN
WHOSE
SURNAME
WAS
MARK
BUT
PAUL
THOUGHT
NOT
GOOD
TO
TAKE
HIM
WITH
THEM
WHO
DEPARTED
FROM
THEM
FROM
PAMPHYLIA
AND
WENT
NOT
WITH
THEM
TO
THE
WORK
AND
THE
CONTENTION
WAS
SO
SHARP
BETWEEN
THEM
THAT
THEY
DEPARTED
ASUNDER
ONE
FROM
THE
OTHER
AND
SO
BARNABAS
TOOK
MARK
AND
SAILED
UNTO
CYPRUS
AND
PAUL
CHOSE
SILAS
AND
DEPARTED
BEING
RECOMMENDED
BY
THE
BRETHREN
UNTO
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
AND
HE
WENT
THROUGH
SYRIA
AND
CILICIA
CONFIRMING
THE
CHURCHES
THEN
CAME
HE
TO
DERBE
AND
LYSTRA
AND
BEHOLD
A
CERTAIN
DISCIPLE
WAS
THERE
NAMED
TIMOTHEUS
THE
SON
OF
A
CERTAIN
WOMAN
WHICH
WAS
A
JEWESS
AND
BELIEVED
BUT
HIS
FATHER
WAS
A
GREEK
WHICH
WAS
WELL
REPORTED
OF
BY
THE
BRETHREN
THAT
WERE
AT
LYSTRA
AND
ICONIUM
HIM
WOULD
PAUL
HAVE
TO
GO
FORTH
WITH
HIM
AND
TOOK
AND
CIRCUMCISED
HIM
BECAUSE
OF
THE
JEWS
WHICH
WERE
IN
THOSE
QUARTERS
FOR
THEY
KNEW
ALL
THAT
HIS
FATHER
WAS
A
GREEK
AND
AS
THEY
WENT
THROUGH
THE
CITIES
THEY
DELIVERED
THEM
THE
DECREES
FOR
TO
KEEP
THAT
WERE
ORDAINED
OF
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ELDERS
WHICH
WERE
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
SO
WERE
THE
CHURCHES
ESTABLISHED
IN
THE
FAITH
AND
INCREASED
IN
NUMBER
DAILY
NOW
WHEN
THEY
HAD
GONE
THROUGHOUT
PHRYGIA
AND
THE
REGION
OF
GALATIA
AND
WERE
FORBIDDEN
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
TO
PREACH
THE
WORD
IN
ASIA
AFTER
THEY
WERE
COME
TO
MYSIA
THEY
ASSAYED
TO
GO
INTO
BITHYNIA
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
SUFFERED
THEM
NOT
AND
THEY
PASSING
BY
MYSIA
CAME
DOWN
TO
TROAS
AND
A
VISION
APPEARED
TO
PAUL
IN
THE
NIGHT
THERE
STOOD
A
MAN
OF
MACEDONIA
AND
PRAYED
HIM
SAYING
COME
OVER
INTO
MACEDONIA
AND
HELP
US
AND
AFTER
HE
HAD
SEEN
THE
VISION
IMMEDIATELY
WE
ENDEAVOURED
TO
GO
INTO
MACEDONIA
ASSUREDLY
GATHERING
THAT
THE
LORD
HAD
CALLED
US
FOR
TO
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
UNTO
THEM
THEREFORE
LOOSING
FROM
TROAS
WE
CAME
WITH
A
STRAIGHT
COURSE
TO
SAMOTHRACIA
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
TO
NEAPOLIS
AND
FROM
THENCE
TO
PHILIPPI
WHICH
IS
THE
CHIEF
CITY
OF
THAT
PART
OF
MACEDONIA
AND
A
COLONY
AND
WE
WERE
IN
THAT
CITY
ABIDING
CERTAIN
DAYS
AND
ON
THE
SABBATH
WE
WENT
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
BY
A
RIVER
SIDE
WHERE
PRAYER
WAS
WONT
TO
BE
MADE
AND
WE
SAT
DOWN
AND
SPAKE
UNTO
THE
WOMEN
WHICH
RESORTED
THITHER
AND
A
CERTAIN
WOMAN
NAMED
LYDIA
A
SELLER
OF
PURPLE
OF
THE
CITY
OF
THYATIRA
WHICH
WORSHIPPED
GOD
HEARD
US
WHOSE
HEART
THE
LORD
OPENED
THAT
SHE
ATTENDED
UNTO
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
OF
PAUL
AND
WHEN
SHE
WAS
BAPTIZED
AND
HER
HOUSEHOLD
SHE
BESOUGHT
US
SAYING
IF
YE
HAVE
JUDGED
ME
TO
BE
FAITHFUL
TO
THE
LORD
COME
INTO
MY
HOUSE
AND
ABIDE
THERE
AND
SHE
CONSTRAINED
US
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
AS
WE
WENT
TO
PRAYER
A
CERTAIN
DAMSEL
POSSESSED
WITH
A
SPIRIT
OF
DIVINATION
MET
US
WHICH
BROUGHT
HER
MASTERS
MUCH
GAIN
BY
SOOTHSAYING
THE
SAME
FOLLOWED
PAUL
AND
US
AND
CRIED
SAYING
THESE
MEN
ARE
THE
SERVANTS
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
GOD
WHICH
SHEW
UNTO
US
THE
WAY
OF
SALVATION
AND
THIS
DID
SHE
MANY
DAYS
BUT
PAUL
BEING
GRIEVED
TURNED
AND
SAID
TO
THE
SPIRIT
I
COMMAND
THEE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
TO
COME
OUT
OF
HER
AND
HE
CAME
OUT
THE
SAME
HOUR
AND
WHEN
HER
MASTERS
SAW
THAT
THE
HOPE
OF
THEIR
GAINS
WAS
GONE
THEY
CAUGHT
PAUL
AND
SILAS
AND
DREW
THEM
INTO
THE
MARKETPLACE
UNTO
THE
RULERS
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
TO
THE
MAGISTRATES
SAYING
THESE
MEN
BEING
JEWS
DO
EXCEEDINGLY
TROUBLE
OUR
CITY
AND
TEACH
CUSTOMS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
LAWFUL
FOR
US
TO
RECEIVE
NEITHER
TO
OBSERVE
BEING
ROMANS
AND
THE
MULTITUDE
ROSE
UP
TOGETHER
AGAINST
THEM
AND
THE
MAGISTRATES
RENT
OFF
THEIR
CLOTHES
AND
COMMANDED
TO
BEAT
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
LAID
MANY
STRIPES
UPON
THEM
THEY
CAST
THEM
INTO
PRISON
CHARGING
THE
JAILOR
TO
KEEP
THEM
SAFELY
WHO
HAVING
RECEIVED
SUCH
A
CHARGE
THRUST
THEM
INTO
THE
INNER
PRISON
AND
MADE
THEIR
FEET
FAST
IN
THE
STOCKS
AND
AT
MIDNIGHT
PAUL
AND
SILAS
PRAYED
AND
SANG
PRAISES
UNTO
GOD
AND
THE
PRISONERS
HEARD
THEM
AND
SUDDENLY
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
EARTHQUAKE
SO
THAT
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
THE
PRISON
WERE
SHAKEN
AND
IMMEDIATELY
ALL
THE
DOORS
WERE
OPENED
AND
EVERY
ONE'S
BANDS
WERE
LOOSED
AND
THE
KEEPER
OF
THE
PRISON
AWAKING
OUT
OF
HIS
SLEEP
AND
SEEING
THE
PRISON
DOORS
OPEN
HE
DREW
OUT
HIS
SWORD
AND
WOULD
HAVE
KILLED
HIMSELF
SUPPOSING
THAT
THE
PRISONERS
HAD
BEEN
FLED
BUT
PAUL
CRIED
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
SAYING
DO
THYSELF
NO
HARM
FOR
WE
ARE
ALL
HERE
THEN
HE
CALLED
FOR
A
LIGHT
AND
SPRANG
IN
AND
CAME
TREMBLING
AND
FELL
DOWN
BEFORE
PAUL
AND
SILAS
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
OUT
AND
SAID
SIRS
WHAT
MUST
I
DO
TO
BE
SAVED
AND
THEY
SAID
BELIEVE
ON
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
THOU
SHALT
BE
SAVED
AND
THY
HOUSE
AND
THEY
SPAKE
UNTO
HIM
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
AND
TO
ALL
THAT
WERE
IN
HIS
HOUSE
AND
HE
TOOK
THEM
THE
SAME
HOUR
OF
THE
NIGHT
AND
WASHED
THEIR
STRIPES
AND
WAS
BAPTIZED
HE
AND
ALL
HIS
STRAIGHTWAY
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
BROUGHT
THEM
INTO
HIS
HOUSE
HE
SET
MEAT
BEFORE
THEM
AND
REJOICED
BELIEVING
IN
GOD
WITH
ALL
HIS
HOUSE
AND
WHEN
IT
WAS
DAY
THE
MAGISTRATES
SENT
THE
SERJEANTS
SAYING
LET
THOSE
MEN
GO
AND
THE
KEEPER
OF
THE
PRISON
TOLD
THIS
SAYING
TO
PAUL
THE
MAGISTRATES
HAVE
SENT
TO
LET
YOU
GO
NOW
THEREFORE
DEPART
AND
GO
IN
PEACE
BUT
PAUL
SAID
UNTO
THEM
THEY
HAVE
BEATEN
US
OPENLY
UNCONDEMNED
BEING
ROMANS
AND
HAVE
CAST
US
INTO
PRISON
AND
NOW
DO
THEY
THRUST
US
OUT
PRIVILY
NAY
VERILY
BUT
LET
THEM
COME
THEMSELVES
AND
FETCH
US
OUT
AND
THE
SERJEANTS
TOLD
THESE
WORDS
UNTO
THE
MAGISTRATES
AND
THEY
FEARED
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
THEY
WERE
ROMANS
AND
THEY
CAME
AND
BESOUGHT
THEM
AND
BROUGHT
THEM
OUT
AND
DESIRED
THEM
TO
DEPART
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AND
THEY
WENT
OUT
OF
THE
PRISON
AND
ENTERED
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
LYDIA
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
SEEN
THE
BRETHREN
THEY
COMFORTED
THEM
AND
DEPARTED
NOW
WHEN
THEY
HAD
PASSED
THROUGH
AMPHIPOLIS
AND
APOLLONIA
THEY
CAME
TO
THESSALONICA
WHERE
WAS
A
SYNAGOGUE
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
PAUL
AS
HIS
MANNER
WAS
WENT
IN
UNTO
THEM
AND
THREE
SABBATH
DAYS
REASONED
WITH
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
OPENING
AND
ALLEGING
THAT
CHRIST
MUST
NEEDS
HAVE
SUFFERED
AND
RISEN
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
THAT
THIS
JESUS
WHOM
I
PREACH
UNTO
YOU
IS
CHRIST
AND
SOME
OF
THEM
BELIEVED
AND
CONSORTED
WITH
PAUL
AND
SILAS
AND
OF
THE
DEVOUT
GREEKS
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
AND
OF
THE
CHIEF
WOMEN
NOT
A
FEW
BUT
THE
JEWS
WHICH
BELIEVED
NOT
MOVED
WITH
ENVY
TOOK
UNTO
THEM
CERTAIN
LEWD
FELLOWS
OF
THE
BASER
SORT
AND
GATHERED
A
COMPANY
AND
SET
ALL
THE
CITY
ON
AN
UPROAR
AND
ASSAULTED
THE
HOUSE
OF
JASON
AND
SOUGHT
TO
BRING
THEM
OUT
TO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WHEN
THEY
FOUND
THEM
NOT
THEY
DREW
JASON
AND
CERTAIN
BRETHREN
UNTO
THE
RULERS
OF
THE
CITY
CRYING
THESE
THAT
HAVE
TURNED
THE
WORLD
UPSIDE
DOWN
ARE
COME
HITHER
ALSO
WHOM
JASON
HATH
RECEIVED
AND
THESE
ALL
DO
CONTRARY
TO
THE
DECREES
OF
CAESAR
SAYING
THAT
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
KING
ONE
JESUS
AND
THEY
TROUBLED
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
RULERS
OF
THE
CITY
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
SECURITY
OF
JASON
AND
OF
THE
OTHER
THEY
LET
THEM
GO
AND
THE
BRETHREN
IMMEDIATELY
SENT
AWAY
PAUL
AND
SILAS
BY
NIGHT
UNTO
BEREA
WHO
COMING
THITHER
WENT
INTO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
OF
THE
JEWS
THESE
WERE
MORE
NOBLE
THAN
THOSE
IN
THESSALONICA
IN
THAT
THEY
RECEIVED
THE
WORD
WITH
ALL
READINESS
OF
MIND
AND
SEARCHED
THE
SCRIPTURES
DAILY
WHETHER
THOSE
THINGS
WERE
SO
THEREFORE
MANY
OF
THEM
BELIEVED
ALSO
OF
HONOURABLE
WOMEN
WHICH
WERE
GREEKS
AND
OF
MEN
NOT
A
FEW
BUT
WHEN
THE
JEWS
OF
THESSALONICA
HAD
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
WAS
PREACHED
OF
PAUL
AT
BEREA
THEY
CAME
THITHER
ALSO
AND
STIRRED
UP
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THEN
IMMEDIATELY
THE
BRETHREN
SENT
AWAY
PAUL
TO
GO
AS
IT
WERE
TO
THE
SEA
BUT
SILAS
AND
TIMOTHEUS
ABODE
THERE
STILL
AND
THEY
THAT
CONDUCTED
PAUL
BROUGHT
HIM
UNTO
ATHENS
AND
RECEIVING
A
COMMANDMENT
UNTO
SILAS
AND
TIMOTHEUS
FOR
TO
COME
TO
HIM
WITH
ALL
SPEED
THEY
DEPARTED
NOW
WHILE
PAUL
WAITED
FOR
THEM
AT
ATHENS
HIS
SPIRIT
WAS
STIRRED
IN
HIM
WHEN
HE
SAW
THE
CITY
WHOLLY
GIVEN
TO
IDOLATRY
THEREFORE
DISPUTED
HE
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
WITH
THE
JEWS
AND
WITH
THE
DEVOUT
PERSONS
AND
IN
THE
MARKET
DAILY
WITH
THEM
THAT
MET
WITH
HIM
THEN
CERTAIN
PHILOSOPHERS
OF
THE
EPICUREANS
AND
OF
THE
STOICKS
ENCOUNTERED
HIM
AND
SOME
SAID
WHAT
WILL
THIS
BABBLER
SAY
OTHER
SOME
HE
SEEMETH
TO
BE
A
SETTER
FORTH
OF
STRANGE
GODS
BECAUSE
HE
PREACHED
UNTO
THEM
JESUS
AND
THE
RESURRECTION
AND
THEY
TOOK
HIM
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
UNTO
AREOPAGUS
SAYING
MAY
WE
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
NEW
DOCTRINE
WHEREOF
THOU
SPEAKEST
IS
FOR
THOU
BRINGEST
CERTAIN
STRANGE
THINGS
TO
OUR
EARS
WE
WOULD
KNOW
THEREFORE
WHAT
THESE
THINGS
MEAN
FOR
ALL
THE
ATHENIANS
AND
STRANGERS
WHICH
WERE
THERE
SPENT
THEIR
TIME
IN
NOTHING
ELSE
BUT
EITHER
TO
TELL
OR
TO
HEAR
SOME
NEW
THING
THEN
PAUL
STOOD
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
MARS'
HILL
AND
SAID
YE
MEN
OF
ATHENS
I
PERCEIVE
THAT
IN
ALL
THINGS
YE
ARE
TOO
SUPERSTITIOUS
FOR
AS
I
PASSED
BY
AND
BEHELD
YOUR
DEVOTIONS
I
FOUND
AN
ALTAR
WITH
THIS
INSCRIPTION
TO
THE
UNKNOWN
GOD
WHOM
THEREFORE
YE
IGNORANTLY
WORSHIP
HIM
DECLARE
I
UNTO
YOU
GOD
THAT
MADE
THE
WORLD
AND
ALL
THINGS
THEREIN
SEEING
THAT
HE
IS
LORD
OF
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
DWELLETH
NOT
IN
TEMPLES
MADE
WITH
HANDS
NEITHER
IS
WORSHIPPED
WITH
MEN'S
HANDS
AS
THOUGH
HE
NEEDED
ANY
THING
SEEING
HE
GIVETH
TO
ALL
LIFE
AND
BREATH
AND
ALL
THINGS
AND
HATH
MADE
OF
ONE
BLOOD
ALL
NATIONS
OF
MEN
FOR
TO
DWELL
ON
ALL
THE
FACE
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
HATH
DETERMINED
THE
TIMES
BEFORE
APPOINTED
AND
THE
BOUNDS
OF
THEIR
HABITATION
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SEEK
THE
LORD
IF
HAPLY
THEY
MIGHT
FEEL
AFTER
HIM
AND
FIND
HIM
THOUGH
HE
BE
NOT
FAR
FROM
EVERY
ONE
OF
US
FOR
IN
HIM
WE
LIVE
AND
MOVE
AND
HAVE
OUR
BEING
AS
CERTAIN
ALSO
OF
YOUR
OWN
POETS
HAVE
SAID
FOR
WE
ARE
ALSO
HIS
OFFSPRING
FORASMUCH
THEN
AS
WE
ARE
THE
OFFSPRING
OF
GOD
WE
OUGHT
NOT
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
GODHEAD
IS
LIKE
UNTO
GOLD
OR
SILVER
OR
STONE
GRAVEN
BY
ART
AND
MAN'S
DEVICE
AND
THE
TIMES
OF
THIS
IGNORANCE
GOD
WINKED
AT
BUT
NOW
COMMANDETH
ALL
MEN
EVERY
WHERE
TO
REPENT
BECAUSE
HE
HATH
APPOINTED
A
DAY
IN
THE
WHICH
HE
WILL
JUDGE
THE
WORLD
IN
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BY
THAT
MAN
WHOM
HE
HATH
ORDAINED
WHEREOF
HE
HATH
GIVEN
ASSURANCE
UNTO
ALL
MEN
IN
THAT
HE
HATH
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
SOME
MOCKED
AND
OTHERS
SAID
WE
WILL
HEAR
THEE
AGAIN
OF
THIS
MATTER
SO
PAUL
DEPARTED
FROM
AMONG
THEM
HOWBEIT
CERTAIN
MEN
CLAVE
UNTO
HIM
AND
BELIEVED
AMONG
THE
WHICH
WAS
DIONYSIUS
THE
AREOPAGITE
AND
A
WOMAN
NAMED
DAMARIS
AND
OTHERS
WITH
THEM
AFTER
THESE
THINGS
PAUL
DEPARTED
FROM
ATHENS
AND
CAME
TO
CORINTH
AND
FOUND
A
CERTAIN
JEW
NAMED
AQUILA
BORN
IN
PONTUS
LATELY
COME
FROM
ITALY
WITH
HIS
WIFE
PRISCILLA
BECAUSE
THAT
CLAUDIUS
HAD
COMMANDED
ALL
JEWS
TO
DEPART
FROM
ROME
AND
CAME
UNTO
THEM
AND
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
OF
THE
SAME
CRAFT
HE
ABODE
WITH
THEM
AND
WROUGHT
FOR
BY
THEIR
OCCUPATION
THEY
WERE
TENTMAKERS
AND
HE
REASONED
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
EVERY
SABBATH
AND
PERSUADED
THE
JEWS
AND
THE
GREEKS
AND
WHEN
SILAS
AND
TIMOTHEUS
WERE
COME
FROM
MACEDONIA
PAUL
WAS
PRESSED
IN
THE
SPIRIT
AND
TESTIFIED
TO
THE
JEWS
THAT
JESUS
WAS
CHRIST
AND
WHEN
THEY
OPPOSED
THEMSELVES
AND
BLASPHEMED
HE
SHOOK
HIS
RAIMENT
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YOUR
BLOOD
BE
UPON
YOUR
OWN
HEADS
I
AM
CLEAN
FROM
HENCEFORTH
I
WILL
GO
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
HE
DEPARTED
THENCE
AND
ENTERED
INTO
A
CERTAIN
MAN'S
HOUSE
NAMED
JUSTUS
ONE
THAT
WORSHIPPED
GOD
WHOSE
HOUSE
JOINED
HARD
TO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
CRISPUS
THE
CHIEF
RULER
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
BELIEVED
ON
THE
LORD
WITH
ALL
HIS
HOUSE
AND
MANY
OF
THE
CORINTHIANS
HEARING
BELIEVED
AND
WERE
BAPTIZED
THEN
SPAKE
THE
LORD
TO
PAUL
IN
THE
NIGHT
BY
A
VISION
BE
NOT
AFRAID
BUT
SPEAK
AND
HOLD
NOT
THY
PEACE
FOR
I
AM
WITH
THEE
AND
NO
MAN
SHALL
SET
ON
THEE
TO
HURT
THEE
FOR
I
HAVE
MUCH
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
CITY
AND
HE
CONTINUED
THERE
A
YEAR
AND
SIX
MONTHS
TEACHING
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AMONG
THEM
AND
WHEN
GALLIO
WAS
THE
DEPUTY
OF
ACHAIA
THE
JEWS
MADE
INSURRECTION
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
AGAINST
PAUL
AND
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
SAYING
THIS
FELLOW
PERSUADETH
MEN
TO
WORSHIP
GOD
CONTRARY
TO
THE
LAW
AND
WHEN
PAUL
WAS
NOW
ABOUT
TO
OPEN
HIS
MOUTH
GALLIO
SAID
UNTO
THE
JEWS
IF
IT
WERE
A
MATTER
OF
WRONG
OR
WICKED
LEWDNESS
O
YE
JEWS
REASON
WOULD
THAT
I
SHOULD
BEAR
WITH
YOU
BUT
IF
IT
BE
A
QUESTION
OF
WORDS
AND
NAMES
AND
OF
YOUR
LAW
LOOK
YE
TO
IT
FOR
I
WILL
BE
NO
JUDGE
OF
SUCH
MATTERS
AND
HE
DRAVE
THEM
FROM
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
THEN
ALL
THE
GREEKS
TOOK
SOSTHENES
THE
CHIEF
RULER
OF
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
BEAT
HIM
BEFORE
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
AND
GALLIO
CARED
FOR
NONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
AND
PAUL
AFTER
THIS
TARRIED
THERE
YET
A
GOOD
WHILE
AND
THEN
TOOK
HIS
LEAVE
OF
THE
BRETHREN
AND
SAILED
THENCE
INTO
SYRIA
AND
WITH
HIM
PRISCILLA
AND
AQUILA
HAVING
SHORN
HIS
HEAD
IN
CENCHREA
FOR
HE
HAD
A
VOW
AND
HE
CAME
TO
EPHESUS
AND
LEFT
THEM
THERE
BUT
HE
HIMSELF
ENTERED
INTO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
REASONED
WITH
THE
JEWS
WHEN
THEY
DESIRED
HIM
TO
TARRY
LONGER
TIME
WITH
THEM
HE
CONSENTED
NOT
BUT
BADE
THEM
FAREWELL
SAYING
I
MUST
BY
ALL
MEANS
KEEP
THIS
FEAST
THAT
COMETH
IN
JERUSALEM
BUT
I
WILL
RETURN
AGAIN
UNTO
YOU
IF
GOD
WILL
AND
HE
SAILED
FROM
EPHESUS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
LANDED
AT
CAESAREA
AND
GONE
UP
AND
SALUTED
THE
CHURCH
HE
WENT
DOWN
TO
ANTIOCH
AND
AFTER
HE
HAD
SPENT
SOME
TIME
THERE
HE
DEPARTED
AND
WENT
OVER
ALL
THE
COUNTRY
OF
GALATIA
AND
PHRYGIA
IN
ORDER
STRENGTHENING
ALL
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
A
CERTAIN
JEW
NAMED
APOLLOS
BORN
AT
ALEXANDRIA
AN
ELOQUENT
MAN
AND
MIGHTY
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
CAME
TO
EPHESUS
THIS
MAN
WAS
INSTRUCTED
IN
THE
WAY
OF
THE
LORD
AND
BEING
FERVENT
IN
THE
SPIRIT
HE
SPAKE
AND
TAUGHT
DILIGENTLY
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
LORD
KNOWING
ONLY
THE
BAPTISM
OF
JOHN
AND
HE
BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
BOLDLY
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
WHOM
WHEN
AQUILA
AND
PRISCILLA
HAD
HEARD
THEY
TOOK
HIM
UNTO
THEM
AND
EXPOUNDED
UNTO
HIM
THE
WAY
OF
GOD
MORE
PERFECTLY
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
DISPOSED
TO
PASS
INTO
ACHAIA
THE
BRETHREN
WROTE
EXHORTING
THE
DISCIPLES
TO
RECEIVE
HIM
WHO
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
HELPED
THEM
MUCH
WHICH
HAD
BELIEVED
THROUGH
GRACE
FOR
HE
MIGHTILY
CONVINCED
THE
JEWS
AND
THAT
PUBLICKLY
SHEWING
BY
THE
SCRIPTURES
THAT
JESUS
WAS
CHRIST
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHILE
APOLLOS
WAS
AT
CORINTH
PAUL
HAVING
PASSED
THROUGH
THE
UPPER
COASTS
CAME
TO
EPHESUS
AND
FINDING
CERTAIN
DISCIPLES
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
HAVE
YE
RECEIVED
THE
HOLY
GHOST
SINCE
YE
BELIEVED
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WE
HAVE
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
HEARD
WHETHER
THERE
BE
ANY
HOLY
GHOST
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
UNTO
WHAT
THEN
WERE
YE
BAPTIZED
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
JOHN'S
BAPTISM
THEN
SAID
PAUL
JOHN
VERILY
BAPTIZED
WITH
THE
BAPTISM
OF
REPENTANCE
SAYING
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
WHICH
SHOULD
COME
AFTER
HIM
THAT
IS
ON
CHRIST
JESUS
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THIS
THEY
WERE
BAPTIZED
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
AND
WHEN
PAUL
HAD
LAID
HIS
HANDS
UPON
THEM
THE
HOLY
GHOST
CAME
ON
THEM
AND
THEY
SPAKE
WITH
TONGUES
AND
PROPHESIED
AND
ALL
THE
MEN
WERE
ABOUT
TWELVE
AND
HE
WENT
INTO
THE
SYNAGOGUE
AND
SPAKE
BOLDLY
FOR
THE
SPACE
OF
THREE
MONTHS
DISPUTING
AND
PERSUADING
THE
THINGS
CONCERNING
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
BUT
WHEN
DIVERS
WERE
HARDENED
AND
BELIEVED
NOT
BUT
SPAKE
EVIL
OF
THAT
WAY
BEFORE
THE
MULTITUDE
HE
DEPARTED
FROM
THEM
AND
SEPARATED
THE
DISCIPLES
DISPUTING
DAILY
IN
THE
SCHOOL
OF
ONE
TYRANNUS
AND
THIS
CONTINUED
BY
THE
SPACE
OF
TWO
YEARS
SO
THAT
ALL
THEY
WHICH
DWELT
IN
ASIA
HEARD
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
BOTH
JEWS
AND
GREEKS
AND
GOD
WROUGHT
SPECIAL
MIRACLES
BY
THE
HANDS
OF
PAUL
SO
THAT
FROM
HIS
BODY
WERE
BROUGHT
UNTO
THE
SICK
HANDKERCHIEFS
OR
APRONS
AND
THE
DISEASES
DEPARTED
FROM
THEM
AND
THE
EVIL
SPIRITS
WENT
OUT
OF
THEM
THEN
CERTAIN
OF
THE
VAGABOND
JEWS
EXORCISTS
TOOK
UPON
THEM
TO
CALL
OVER
THEM
WHICH
HAD
EVIL
SPIRITS
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
SAYING
WE
ADJURE
YOU
BY
JESUS
WHOM
PAUL
PREACHETH
AND
THERE
WERE
SEVEN
SONS
OF
ONE
SCEVA
A
JEW
AND
CHIEF
OF
THE
PRIESTS
WHICH
DID
SO
AND
THE
EVIL
SPIRIT
ANSWERED
AND
SAID
JESUS
I
KNOW
AND
PAUL
I
KNOW
BUT
WHO
ARE
YE
AND
THE
MAN
IN
WHOM
THE
EVIL
SPIRIT
WAS
LEAPED
ON
THEM
AND
OVERCAME
THEM
AND
PREVAILED
AGAINST
THEM
SO
THAT
THEY
FLED
OUT
OF
THAT
HOUSE
NAKED
AND
WOUNDED
AND
THIS
WAS
KNOWN
TO
ALL
THE
JEWS
AND
GREEKS
ALSO
DWELLING
AT
EPHESUS
AND
FEAR
FELL
ON
THEM
ALL
AND
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
WAS
MAGNIFIED
AND
MANY
THAT
BELIEVED
CAME
AND
CONFESSED
AND
SHEWED
THEIR
DEEDS
MANY
OF
THEM
ALSO
WHICH
USED
CURIOUS
ARTS
BROUGHT
THEIR
BOOKS
TOGETHER
AND
BURNED
THEM
BEFORE
ALL
MEN
AND
THEY
COUNTED
THE
PRICE
OF
THEM
AND
FOUND
IT
FIFTY
THOUSAND
PIECES
OF
SILVER
SO
MIGHTILY
GREW
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
PREVAILED
AFTER
THESE
THINGS
WERE
ENDED
PAUL
PURPOSED
IN
THE
SPIRIT
WHEN
HE
HAD
PASSED
THROUGH
MACEDONIA
AND
ACHAIA
TO
GO
TO
JERUSALEM
SAYING
AFTER
I
HAVE
BEEN
THERE
I
MUST
ALSO
SEE
ROME
SO
HE
SENT
INTO
MACEDONIA
TWO
OF
THEM
THAT
MINISTERED
UNTO
HIM
TIMOTHEUS
AND
ERASTUS
BUT
HE
HIMSELF
STAYED
IN
ASIA
FOR
A
SEASON
AND
THE
SAME
TIME
THERE
AROSE
NO
SMALL
STIR
ABOUT
THAT
WAY
FOR
A
CERTAIN
MAN
NAMED
DEMETRIUS
A
SILVERSMITH
WHICH
MADE
SILVER
SHRINES
FOR
DIANA
BROUGHT
NO
SMALL
GAIN
UNTO
THE
CRAFTSMEN
WHOM
HE
CALLED
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
WORKMEN
OF
LIKE
OCCUPATION
AND
SAID
SIRS
YE
KNOW
THAT
BY
THIS
CRAFT
WE
HAVE
OUR
WEALTH
MOREOVER
YE
SEE
AND
HEAR
THAT
NOT
ALONE
AT
EPHESUS
BUT
ALMOST
THROUGHOUT
ALL
ASIA
THIS
PAUL
HATH
PERSUADED
AND
TURNED
AWAY
MUCH
PEOPLE
SAYING
THAT
THEY
BE
NO
GODS
WHICH
ARE
MADE
WITH
HANDS
SO
THAT
NOT
ONLY
THIS
OUR
CRAFT
IS
IN
DANGER
TO
BE
SET
AT
NOUGHT
BUT
ALSO
THAT
THE
TEMPLE
OF
THE
GREAT
GODDESS
DIANA
SHOULD
BE
DESPISED
AND
HER
MAGNIFICENCE
SHOULD
BE
DESTROYED
WHOM
ALL
ASIA
AND
THE
WORLD
WORSHIPPETH
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THESE
SAYINGS
THEY
WERE
FULL
OF
WRATH
AND
CRIED
OUT
SAYING
GREAT
IS
DIANA
OF
THE
EPHESIANS
AND
THE
WHOLE
CITY
WAS
FILLED
WITH
CONFUSION
AND
HAVING
CAUGHT
GAIUS
AND
ARISTARCHUS
MEN
OF
MACEDONIA
PAUL'S
COMPANIONS
IN
TRAVEL
THEY
RUSHED
WITH
ONE
ACCORD
INTO
THE
THEATRE
AND
WHEN
PAUL
WOULD
HAVE
ENTERED
IN
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
THE
DISCIPLES
SUFFERED
HIM
NOT
AND
CERTAIN
OF
THE
CHIEF
OF
ASIA
WHICH
WERE
HIS
FRIENDS
SENT
UNTO
HIM
DESIRING
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
ADVENTURE
HIMSELF
INTO
THE
THEATRE
SOME
THEREFORE
CRIED
ONE
THING
AND
SOME
ANOTHER
FOR
THE
ASSEMBLY
WAS
CONFUSED
AND
THE
MORE
PART
KNEW
NOT
WHEREFORE
THEY
WERE
COME
TOGETHER
AND
THEY
DREW
ALEXANDER
OUT
OF
THE
MULTITUDE
THE
JEWS
PUTTING
HIM
FORWARD
AND
ALEXANDER
BECKONED
WITH
THE
HAND
AND
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
HIS
DEFENCE
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
BUT
WHEN
THEY
KNEW
THAT
HE
WAS
A
JEW
ALL
WITH
ONE
VOICE
ABOUT
THE
SPACE
OF
TWO
HOURS
CRIED
OUT
GREAT
IS
DIANA
OF
THE
EPHESIANS
AND
WHEN
THE
TOWNCLERK
HAD
APPEASED
THE
PEOPLE
HE
SAID
YE
MEN
OF
EPHESUS
WHAT
MAN
IS
THERE
THAT
KNOWETH
NOT
HOW
THAT
THE
CITY
OF
THE
EPHESIANS
IS
A
WORSHIPPER
OF
THE
GREAT
GODDESS
DIANA
AND
OF
THE
IMAGE
WHICH
FELL
DOWN
FROM
JUPITER
SEEING
THEN
THAT
THESE
THINGS
CANNOT
BE
SPOKEN
AGAINST
YE
OUGHT
TO
BE
QUIET
AND
TO
DO
NOTHING
RASHLY
FOR
YE
HAVE
BROUGHT
HITHER
THESE
MEN
WHICH
ARE
NEITHER
ROBBERS
OF
CHURCHES
NOR
YET
BLASPHEMERS
OF
YOUR
GODDESS
WHEREFORE
IF
DEMETRIUS
AND
THE
CRAFTSMEN
WHICH
ARE
WITH
HIM
HAVE
A
MATTER
AGAINST
ANY
MAN
THE
LAW
IS
OPEN
AND
THERE
ARE
DEPUTIES
LET
THEM
IMPLEAD
ONE
ANOTHER
BUT
IF
YE
ENQUIRE
ANY
THING
CONCERNING
OTHER
MATTERS
IT
SHALL
BE
DETERMINED
IN
A
LAWFUL
ASSEMBLY
FOR
WE
ARE
IN
DANGER
TO
BE
CALLED
IN
QUESTION
FOR
THIS
DAY'S
UPROAR
THERE
BEING
NO
CAUSE
WHEREBY
WE
MAY
GIVE
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
THIS
CONCOURSE
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
THUS
SPOKEN
HE
DISMISSED
THE
ASSEMBLY
AND
AFTER
THE
UPROAR
WAS
CEASED
PAUL
CALLED
UNTO
HIM
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
EMBRACED
THEM
AND
DEPARTED
FOR
TO
GO
INTO
MACEDONIA
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
GONE
OVER
THOSE
PARTS
AND
HAD
GIVEN
THEM
MUCH
EXHORTATION
HE
CAME
INTO
GREECE
AND
THERE
ABODE
THREE
MONTHS
AND
WHEN
THE
JEWS
LAID
WAIT
FOR
HIM
AS
HE
WAS
ABOUT
TO
SAIL
INTO
SYRIA
HE
PURPOSED
TO
RETURN
THROUGH
MACEDONIA
AND
THERE
ACCOMPANIED
HIM
INTO
ASIA
SOPATER
OF
BEREA
AND
OF
THE
THESSALONIANS
ARISTARCHUS
AND

AND
GAIUS
OF
DERBE
AND
TIMOTHEUS
AND
OF
ASIA
TYCHICUS
AND
TROPHIMUS
THESE
GOING
BEFORE
TARRIED
FOR
US
AT
TROAS
AND
WE
SAILED
AWAY
FROM
PHILIPPI
AFTER
THE
DAYS
OF
UNLEAVENED
BREAD
AND
CAME
UNTO
THEM
TO
TROAS
IN
FIVE
DAYS
WHERE
WE
ABODE
SEVEN
DAYS
AND
UPON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
WHEN
THE
DISCIPLES
CAME
TOGETHER
TO
BREAK
BREAD
PAUL
PREACHED
UNTO
THEM
READY
TO
DEPART
ON
THE
MORROW
AND
CONTINUED
HIS
SPEECH
UNTIL
MIDNIGHT
AND
THERE
WERE
MANY
LIGHTS
IN
THE
UPPER
CHAMBER
WHERE
THEY
WERE
GATHERED
TOGETHER
AND
THERE
SAT
IN
A
WINDOW
A
CERTAIN
YOUNG
MAN
NAMED
EUTYCHUS
BEING
FALLEN
INTO
A
DEEP
SLEEP
AND
AS
PAUL
WAS
LONG
PREACHING
HE
SUNK
DOWN
WITH
SLEEP
AND
FELL
DOWN
FROM
THE
THIRD
LOFT
AND
WAS
TAKEN
UP
DEAD
AND
PAUL
WENT
DOWN
AND
FELL
ON
HIM
AND
EMBRACING
HIM
SAID
TROUBLE
NOT
YOURSELVES
FOR
HIS
LIFE
IS
IN
HIM
WHEN
HE
THEREFORE
WAS
COME
UP
AGAIN
AND
HAD
BROKEN
BREAD
AND
EATEN
AND
TALKED
A
LONG
WHILE
EVEN
TILL
BREAK
OF
DAY
SO
HE
DEPARTED
AND
THEY
BROUGHT
THE
YOUNG
MAN
ALIVE
AND
WERE
NOT
A
LITTLE
COMFORTED
AND
WE
WENT
BEFORE
TO
SHIP
AND
SAILED
UNTO
ASSOS
THERE
INTENDING
TO
TAKE
IN
PAUL
FOR
SO
HAD
HE
APPOINTED
MINDING
HIMSELF
TO
GO
AFOOT
AND
WHEN
HE
MET
WITH
US
AT
ASSOS
WE
TOOK
HIM
IN
AND
CAME
TO
MITYLENE
AND
WE
SAILED
THENCE
AND
CAME
THE
NEXT
DAY
OVER
AGAINST
CHIOS
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
WE
ARRIVED
AT
SAMOS
AND
TARRIED
AT
TROGYLLIUM
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
WE
CAME
TO
MILETUS
FOR
PAUL
HAD
DETERMINED
TO
SAIL
BY
EPHESUS
BECAUSE
HE
WOULD
NOT
SPEND
THE
TIME
IN
ASIA
FOR
HE
HASTED
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
FOR
HIM
TO
BE
AT
JERUSALEM
THE
DAY
OF
PENTECOST
AND
FROM
MILETUS
HE
SENT
TO
EPHESUS
AND
CALLED
THE
ELDERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
TO
HIM
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
YE
KNOW
FROM
THE
FIRST
DAY
THAT
I
CAME
INTO
ASIA
AFTER
WHAT
MANNER
I
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
YOU
AT
ALL
SEASONS
SERVING
THE
LORD
WITH
ALL
HUMILITY
OF
MIND
AND
WITH
MANY
TEARS
AND
TEMPTATIONS
WHICH
BEFELL
ME
BY
THE
LYING
IN
WAIT
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
HOW
I
KEPT
BACK
NOTHING
THAT
WAS
PROFITABLE
UNTO
YOU
BUT
HAVE
SHEWED
YOU
AND
HAVE
TAUGHT
YOU
PUBLICKLY
AND
FROM
HOUSE
TO
HOUSE
TESTIFYING
BOTH
TO
THE
JEWS
AND
ALSO
TO
THE
GREEKS
REPENTANCE
TOWARD
GOD
AND
FAITH
TOWARD
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
NOW
BEHOLD
I
GO
BOUND
IN
THE
SPIRIT
UNTO
JERUSALEM
NOT
KNOWING
THE
THINGS
THAT
SHALL
BEFALL
ME
THERE
SAVE
THAT
THE
HOLY
GHOST
WITNESSETH
IN
EVERY
CITY
SAYING
THAT
BONDS
AND
AFFLICTIONS
ABIDE
ME
BUT
NONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
MOVE
ME
NEITHER
COUNT
I
MY
LIFE
DEAR
UNTO
MYSELF
SO
THAT
I
MIGHT
FINISH
MY
COURSE
WITH
JOY
AND
THE
MINISTRY
WHICH
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
TO
TESTIFY
THE
GOSPEL
OF
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
AND
NOW
BEHOLD
I
KNOW
THAT
YE
ALL
AMONG
WHOM
I
HAVE
GONE
PREACHING
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
SHALL
SEE
MY
FACE
NO
MORE
WHEREFORE
I
TAKE
YOU
TO
RECORD
THIS
DAY
THAT
I
AM
PURE
FROM
THE
BLOOD
OF
ALL
MEN
FOR
I
HAVE
NOT
SHUNNED
TO
DECLARE
UNTO
YOU
ALL
THE
COUNSEL
OF
GOD
TAKE
HEED
THEREFORE
UNTO
YOURSELVES
AND
TO
ALL
THE
FLOCK
OVER
THE
WHICH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
HATH
MADE
YOU
OVERSEERS
TO
FEED
THE
CHURCH
OF
GOD
WHICH
HE
HATH
PURCHASED
WITH
HIS
OWN
BLOOD
FOR
I
KNOW
THIS
THAT
AFTER
MY
DEPARTING
SHALL
GRIEVOUS
WOLVES
ENTER
IN
AMONG
YOU
NOT
SPARING
THE
FLOCK
ALSO
OF
YOUR
OWN
SELVES
SHALL
MEN
ARISE
SPEAKING
PERVERSE
THINGS
TO
DRAW
AWAY
DISCIPLES
AFTER
THEM
THEREFORE
WATCH
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
BY
THE
SPACE
OF
THREE
YEARS
I
CEASED
NOT
TO
WARN
EVERY
ONE
NIGHT
AND
DAY
WITH
TEARS
AND
NOW
BRETHREN
I
COMMEND
YOU
TO
GOD
AND
TO
THE
WORD
OF
HIS
GRACE
WHICH
IS
ABLE
TO
BUILD
YOU
UP
AND
TO
GIVE
YOU
AN
INHERITANCE
AMONG
ALL
THEM
WHICH
ARE
SANCTIFIED
I
HAVE
COVETED
NO
MAN'S
SILVER
OR
GOLD
OR
APPAREL
YEA
YE
YOURSELVES
KNOW
THAT
THESE
HANDS
HAVE
MINISTERED
UNTO
MY
NECESSITIES
AND
TO
THEM
THAT
WERE
WITH
ME
I
HAVE
SHEWED
YOU
ALL
THINGS
HOW
THAT
SO
LABOURING
YE
OUGHT
TO
SUPPORT
THE
WEAK
AND
TO
REMEMBER
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
HOW
HE
SAID
IT
IS
MORE
BLESSED
TO
GIVE
THAN
TO
RECEIVE
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
THUS
SPOKEN
HE
KNEELED
DOWN
AND
PRAYED
WITH
THEM
ALL
AND
THEY
ALL
WEPT
SORE
AND
FELL
ON
PAUL'S
NECK
AND
KISSED
HIM
SORROWING
MOST
OF
ALL
FOR
THE
WORDS
WHICH
HE
SPAKE
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SEE
HIS
FACE
NO
MORE
AND
THEY
ACCOMPANIED
HIM
UNTO
THE
SHIP
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
AFTER
WE
WERE
GOTTEN
FROM
THEM
AND
HAD
LAUNCHED
WE
CAME
WITH
A
STRAIGHT
COURSE
UNTO
COOS
AND
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
UNTO
RHODES
AND
FROM
THENCE
UNTO
PATARA
AND
FINDING
A
SHIP
SAILING
OVER
UNTO
PHENICIA
WE
WENT
ABOARD
AND
SET
FORTH
NOW
WHEN
WE
HAD
DISCOVERED
CYPRUS
WE
LEFT
IT
ON
THE
LEFT
HAND
AND
SAILED
INTO
SYRIA
AND
LANDED
AT
TYRE
FOR
THERE
THE
SHIP
WAS
TO
UNLADE
HER
BURDEN
AND
FINDING
DISCIPLES
WE
TARRIED
THERE
SEVEN
DAYS
WHO
SAID
TO
PAUL
THROUGH
THE
SPIRIT
THAT
HE
SHOULD
NOT
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
ACCOMPLISHED
THOSE
DAYS
WE
DEPARTED
AND
WENT
OUR
WAY
AND
THEY
ALL
BROUGHT
US
ON
OUR
WAY
WITH
WIVES
AND
CHILDREN
TILL
WE
WERE
OUT
OF
THE
CITY
AND
WE
KNEELED
DOWN
ON
THE
SHORE
AND
PRAYED
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
TAKEN
OUR
LEAVE
ONE
OF
ANOTHER
WE
TOOK
SHIP
AND
THEY
RETURNED
HOME
AGAIN
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
FINISHED
OUR
COURSE
FROM
TYRE
WE
CAME
TO
PTOLEMAIS
AND
SALUTED
THE
BRETHREN
AND
ABODE
WITH
THEM
ONE
DAY
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
WE
THAT
WERE
OF
PAUL'S
COMPANY
DEPARTED
AND
CAME
UNTO
CAESAREA
AND
WE
ENTERED
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
PHILIP
THE
EVANGELIST
WHICH
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
SEVEN
AND
ABODE
WITH
HIM
AND
THE
SAME
MAN
HAD
FOUR
DAUGHTERS
VIRGINS
WHICH
DID
PROPHESY
AND
AS
WE
TARRIED
THERE
MANY
DAYS
THERE
CAME
DOWN
FROM
JUDAEA
A
CERTAIN
PROPHET
NAMED
AGABUS
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
UNTO
US
HE
TOOK
PAUL'S
GIRDLE
AND
BOUND
HIS
OWN
HANDS
AND
FEET
AND
SAID
THUS
SAITH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
SO
SHALL
THE
JEWS
AT
JERUSALEM
BIND
THE
MAN
THAT
OWNETH
THIS
GIRDLE
AND
SHALL
DELIVER
HIM
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
GENTILES
AND
WHEN
WE
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
BOTH
WE
AND
THEY
OF
THAT
PLACE
BESOUGHT
HIM
NOT
TO
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
THEN
PAUL
ANSWERED
WHAT
MEAN
YE
TO
WEEP
AND
TO
BREAK
MINE
HEART
FOR
I
AM
READY
NOT
TO
BE
BOUND
ONLY
BUT
ALSO
TO
DIE
AT
JERUSALEM
FOR
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
AND
WHEN
HE
WOULD
NOT
BE
PERSUADED
WE
CEASED
SAYING
THE
WILL
OF
THE
LORD
BE
DONE
AND
AFTER
THOSE
DAYS
WE
TOOK
UP
OUR
CARRIAGES
AND
WENT
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
THERE
WENT
WITH
US
ALSO
CERTAIN
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
OF
CAESAREA
AND
BROUGHT
WITH
THEM
ONE
MNASON
OF
CYPRUS
AN
OLD
DISCIPLE
WITH
WHOM
WE
SHOULD
LODGE
AND
WHEN
WE
WERE
COME
TO
JERUSALEM
THE
BRETHREN
RECEIVED
US
GLADLY
AND
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
PAUL
WENT
IN
WITH
US
UNTO
JAMES
AND
ALL
THE
ELDERS
WERE
PRESENT
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
SALUTED
THEM
HE
DECLARED
PARTICULARLY
WHAT
THINGS
GOD
HAD
WROUGHT
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
BY
HIS
MINISTRY
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
IT
THEY
GLORIFIED
THE
LORD
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
SEEST
BROTHER
HOW
MANY
THOUSANDS
OF
JEWS
THERE
ARE
WHICH
BELIEVE
AND
THEY
ARE
ALL
ZEALOUS
OF
THE
LAW
AND
THEY
ARE
INFORMED
OF
THEE
THAT
THOU
TEACHEST
ALL
THE
JEWS
WHICH
ARE
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
TO
FORSAKE
MOSES
SAYING
THAT
THEY
OUGHT
NOT
TO
CIRCUMCISE
THEIR
CHILDREN
NEITHER
TO
WALK
AFTER
THE
CUSTOMS
WHAT
IS
IT
THEREFORE
THE
MULTITUDE
MUST
NEEDS
COME
TOGETHER
FOR
THEY
WILL
HEAR
THAT
THOU
ART
COME
DO
THEREFORE
THIS
THAT
WE
SAY
TO
THEE
WE
HAVE
FOUR
MEN
WHICH
HAVE
A
VOW
ON
THEM
THEM
TAKE
AND
PURIFY
THYSELF
WITH
THEM
AND
BE
AT
CHARGES
WITH
THEM
THAT
THEY
MAY
SHAVE
THEIR
HEADS
AND
ALL
MAY
KNOW
THAT
THOSE
THINGS
WHEREOF
THEY
WERE
INFORMED
CONCERNING
THEE
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
THAT
THOU
THYSELF
ALSO
WALKEST
ORDERLY
AND
KEEPEST
THE
LAW
AS
TOUCHING
THE
GENTILES
WHICH
BELIEVE
WE
HAVE
WRITTEN
AND
CONCLUDED
THAT
THEY
OBSERVE
NO
SUCH
THING
SAVE
ONLY
THAT
THEY
KEEP
THEMSELVES
FROM
THINGS
OFFERED
TO
IDOLS
AND
FROM
BLOOD
AND
FROM
STRANGLED
AND
FROM
FORNICATION
THEN
PAUL
TOOK
THE
MEN
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
PURIFYING
HIMSELF
WITH
THEM
ENTERED
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
TO
SIGNIFY
THE
ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF
THE
DAYS
OF
PURIFICATION
UNTIL
THAT
AN
OFFERING
SHOULD
BE
OFFERED
FOR
EVERY
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
WHEN
THE
SEVEN
DAYS
WERE
ALMOST
ENDED
THE
JEWS
WHICH
WERE
OF
ASIA
WHEN
THEY
SAW
HIM
IN
THE
TEMPLE
STIRRED
UP
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
AND
LAID
HANDS
ON
HIM
CRYING
OUT
MEN
OF
ISRAEL
HELP
THIS
IS
THE
MAN
THAT
TEACHETH
ALL
MEN
EVERY
WHERE
AGAINST
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
LAW
AND
THIS
PLACE
AND
FURTHER
BROUGHT
GREEKS
ALSO
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
AND
HATH
POLLUTED
THIS
HOLY
PLACE
FOR
THEY
HAD
SEEN
BEFORE
WITH
HIM
IN
THE
CITY
TROPHIMUS
AN
EPHESIAN
WHOM
THEY
SUPPOSED
THAT
PAUL
HAD
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
TEMPLE
AND
ALL
THE
CITY
WAS
MOVED
AND
THE
PEOPLE
RAN
TOGETHER
AND
THEY
TOOK
PAUL
AND
DREW
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
TEMPLE
AND
FORTHWITH
THE
DOORS
WERE
SHUT
AND
AS
THEY
WENT
ABOUT
TO
KILL
HIM
TIDINGS
CAME
UNTO
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
BAND
THAT
ALL
JERUSALEM
WAS
IN
AN
UPROAR
WHO
IMMEDIATELY
TOOK
SOLDIERS
AND
CENTURIONS
AND
RAN
DOWN
UNTO
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
AND
THE
SOLDIERS
THEY
LEFT
BEATING
OF
PAUL
THEN
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
CAME
NEAR
AND
TOOK
HIM
AND
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
BE
BOUND
WITH
TWO
CHAINS
AND
DEMANDED
WHO
HE
WAS
AND
WHAT
HE
HAD
DONE
AND
SOME
CRIED
ONE
THING
SOME
ANOTHER
AMONG
THE
MULTITUDE
AND
WHEN
HE
COULD
NOT
KNOW
THE
CERTAINTY
FOR
THE
TUMULT
HE
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
BE
CARRIED
INTO
THE
CASTLE
AND
WHEN
HE
CAME
UPON
THE
STAIRS
SO
IT
WAS
THAT
HE
WAS
BORNE
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
FOR
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FOLLOWED
AFTER
CRYING
AWAY
WITH
HIM
AND
AS
PAUL
WAS
TO
BE
LED
INTO
THE
CASTLE
HE
SAID
UNTO
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
MAY
I
SPEAK
UNTO
THEE
WHO
SAID
CANST
THOU
SPEAK
GREEK
ART
NOT
THOU
THAT
EGYPTIAN
WHICH
BEFORE
THESE
DAYS
MADEST
AN
UPROAR
AND
LEDDEST
OUT
INTO
THE
WILDERNESS
FOUR
THOUSAND
MEN
THAT
WERE
MURDERERS
BUT
PAUL
SAID
I
AM
A
MAN
WHICH
AM
A
JEW
OF
TARSUS
A
CITY
IN
CILICIA
A
CITIZEN
OF
NO
MEAN
CITY
AND
I
BESEECH
THEE
SUFFER
ME
TO
SPEAK
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
LICENCE
PAUL
STOOD
ON
THE
STAIRS
AND
BECKONED
WITH
THE
HAND
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WHEN
THERE
WAS
MADE
A
GREAT
SILENCE
HE
SPAKE
UNTO
THEM
IN
THE
HEBREW
TONGUE
SAYING
MEN
BRETHREN
AND
FATHERS
HEAR
YE
MY
DEFENCE
WHICH
I
MAKE
NOW
UNTO
YOU
AND
WHEN
THEY
HEARD
THAT
HE
SPAKE
IN
THE
HEBREW
TONGUE
TO
THEM
THEY
KEPT
THE
MORE
SILENCE
AND
HE
SAITH
I
AM
VERILY
A
MAN
WHICH
AM
A
JEW
BORN
IN
TARSUS
A
CITY
IN
CILICIA
YET
BROUGHT
UP
IN
THIS
CITY
AT
THE
FEET
OF
GAMALIEL
AND
TAUGHT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PERFECT
MANNER
OF
THE
LAW
OF
THE
FATHERS
AND
WAS
ZEALOUS
TOWARD
GOD
AS
YE
ALL
ARE
THIS
DAY
AND
I
PERSECUTED
THIS
WAY
UNTO
THE
DEATH
BINDING
AND
DELIVERING
INTO
PRISONS
BOTH
MEN
AND
WOMEN
AS
ALSO
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
DOTH
BEAR
ME
WITNESS
AND
ALL
THE
ESTATE
OF
THE
ELDERS
FROM
WHOM
ALSO
I
RECEIVED
LETTERS
UNTO
THE
BRETHREN
AND
WENT
TO
DAMASCUS
TO
BRING
THEM
WHICH
WERE
THERE
BOUND
UNTO
JERUSALEM
FOR
TO
BE
PUNISHED
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
AS
I
MADE
MY
JOURNEY
AND
WAS
COME
NIGH
UNTO
DAMASCUS
ABOUT
NOON
SUDDENLY
THERE
SHONE
FROM
HEAVEN
A
GREAT
LIGHT
ROUND
ABOUT
ME
AND
I
FELL
UNTO
THE
GROUND
AND
HEARD
A
VOICE
SAYING
UNTO
ME
SAUL
SAUL
WHY
PERSECUTEST
THOU
ME
AND
I
ANSWERED
WHO
ART
THOU
LORD
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
I
AM
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
WHOM
THOU
PERSECUTEST
AND
THEY
THAT
WERE
WITH
ME
SAW
INDEED
THE
LIGHT
AND
WERE
AFRAID
BUT
THEY
HEARD
NOT
THE
VOICE
OF
HIM
THAT
SPAKE
TO
ME
AND
I
SAID
WHAT
SHALL
I
DO
LORD
AND
THE
LORD
SAID
UNTO
ME
ARISE
AND
GO
INTO
DAMASCUS
AND
THERE
IT
SHALL
BE
TOLD
THEE
OF
ALL
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
APPOINTED
FOR
THEE
TO
DO
AND
WHEN
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
FOR
THE
GLORY
OF
THAT
LIGHT
BEING
LED
BY
THE
HAND
OF
THEM
THAT
WERE
WITH
ME
I
CAME
INTO
DAMASCUS
AND
ONE
ANANIAS
A
DEVOUT
MAN
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LAW
HAVING
A
GOOD
REPORT
OF
ALL
THE
JEWS
WHICH
DWELT
THERE
CAME
UNTO
ME
AND
STOOD
AND
SAID
UNTO
ME
BROTHER
SAUL
RECEIVE
THY
SIGHT
AND
THE
SAME
HOUR
I
LOOKED
UP
UPON
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
THE
GOD
OF
OUR
FATHERS
HATH
CHOSEN
THEE
THAT
THOU
SHOULDEST
KNOW
HIS
WILL
AND
SEE
THAT
JUST
ONE
AND
SHOULDEST
HEAR
THE
VOICE
OF
HIS
MOUTH
FOR
THOU
SHALT
BE
HIS
WITNESS
UNTO
ALL
MEN
OF
WHAT
THOU
HAST
SEEN
AND
HEARD
AND
NOW
WHY
TARRIEST
THOU
ARISE
AND
BE
BAPTIZED
AND
WASH
AWAY
THY
SINS
CALLING
ON
THE
NAME
OF
THE
LORD
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
WHEN
I
WAS
COME
AGAIN
TO
JERUSALEM
EVEN
WHILE
I
PRAYED
IN
THE
TEMPLE
I
WAS
IN
A
TRANCE
AND
SAW
HIM
SAYING
UNTO
ME
MAKE
HASTE
AND
GET
THEE
QUICKLY
OUT
OF
JERUSALEM
FOR
THEY
WILL
NOT
RECEIVE
THY
TESTIMONY
CONCERNING
ME
AND
I
SAID
LORD
THEY
KNOW
THAT
I
IMPRISONED
AND
BEAT
IN
EVERY
SYNAGOGUE
THEM
THAT
BELIEVED
ON
THEE
AND
WHEN
THE
BLOOD
OF

STEPHEN
WAS
SHED
I
ALSO
WAS
STANDING
BY

CONSENTING
UNTO
HIS
DEATH
AND
KEPT
THE
RAIMENT
OF
THEM
THAT
SLEW
HIM
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
DEPART
FOR
I
WILL
SEND
THEE
FAR
HENCE
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
THEY
GAVE
HIM
AUDIENCE
UNTO
THIS
WORD
AND
THEN
LIFTED
UP
THEIR
VOICES
AND
SAID
AWAY
WITH
SUCH
A
FELLOW
FROM
THE
EARTH
FOR
IT
IS
NOT
FIT
THAT
HE
SHOULD
LIVE
AND
AS
THEY
CRIED
OUT
AND
CAST
OFF
THEIR
CLOTHES
AND
THREW
DUST
INTO
THE
AIR
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
BE
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
CASTLE
AND
BADE
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
EXAMINED
BY
SCOURGING
THAT
HE
MIGHT
KNOW
WHEREFORE
THEY
CRIED
SO
AGAINST
HIM
AND
AS
THEY
BOUND
HIM
WITH
THONGS
PAUL
SAID
UNTO
THE
CENTURION
THAT
STOOD
BY
IS
IT
LAWFUL
FOR
YOU
TO
SCOURGE
A
MAN
THAT
IS
A

AND
UNCONDEMNED
WHEN
THE
CENTURION
HEARD
THAT
HE
WENT
AND
TOLD
THE

CAME
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM

SAID
YEA
AND
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
ANSWERED
WITH
A
GREAT
SUM
OBTAINED
I
THIS
FREEDOM
AND
PAUL
SAID
BUT
I
WAS
FREE
BORN
THEN
STRAIGHTWAY
THEY
DEPARTED
FROM
HIM
WHICH
SHOULD
HAVE
EXAMINED
HIM
AND
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
ALSO
WAS
AFRAID
AFTER
HE
KNEW
THAT
HE
WAS
A
ROMAN
AND
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
BOUND
HIM
ON
THE
MORROW
BECAUSE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
THE
CERTAINTY
WHEREFORE
HE
WAS
ACCUSED
OF
THE
JEWS
HE
LOOSED
HIM
FROM
HIS

AND
COMMANDED
THE
CHIEF

AND
ALL

REVILEST
THOU
GOD'S

WAS
THE

FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THOU
SHALT
NOT
SPEAK
EVIL
OF
THE
RULER
OF

BUT
WHEN
PAUL
PERCEIVED
THAT
THE
ONE
PART
WERE
SADDUCEES
AND
THE
OTHER
PHARISEES
HE
CRIED
OUT
IN
THE
COUNCIL
MEN

THE
SON
OF

WHEN
HE
HAD
SO
SAID
THERE
AROSE
A
DISSENSION
BETWEEN
THE
PHARISEES
AND
THE
SADDUCEES
AND
THE
MULTITUDE
WAS
DIVIDED
FOR
THE
SADDUCEES
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
RESURRECTION
NEITHER
ANGEL
NOR
SPIRIT
BUT
THE
PHARISEES
CONFESS
BOTH
AND
THERE
AROSE
A
GREAT
CRY
AND
THE
SCRIBES
THAT
WERE
OF
THE
PHARISEES'
PART
AROSE
AND
STROVE
SAYING
WE

IN
THIS
MAN
BUT
IF
A
SPIRIT
OR
AN
ANGEL
HATH
SPOKEN
TO
HIM
LET
US
NOT
FIGHT
AGAINST
GOD
AND
WHEN
THERE

BUT
TO

NOTHING
LAID
TO
HIS

WORTHY
OF

A
PESTILENT
FELLOW

OF
SEDITION
AMONG
ALL
THE

THROUGHOUT

ANSWERED
FORASMUCH
AS
I
KNOW
THAT
THOU
HAST
BEEN
OF
MANY
YEARS
A
JUDGE
UNTO
THIS
NATION
I
DO
THE
MORE
CHEERFULLY
ANSWER
FOR
MYSELF
BECAUSE
THAT
THOU
MAYEST
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THERE
ARE
YET
BUT
TWELVE
DAYS
SINCE
I
WENT
UP
TO

FOR
TO
WORSHIP
AND

DISPUTING
WITH
ANY

NEITHER
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUES
NOR
IN
THE

NEITHER
CAN
THEY
PROVE
THE
THINGS
WHEREOF
THEY
NOW
ACCUSE
ME
BUT
THIS
I
CONFESS
UNTO
THEE
THAT
AFTER
THE
WAY
WHICH
THEY
CALL
HERESY
SO
WORSHIP
I
THE
GOD
OF
MY
FATHERS
BELIEVING
ALL
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
LAW

IN
THE
PROPHETS
AND
HAVE
HOPE
TOWARD

THEMSELVES
ALSO
ALLOW
THAT
THERE
SHALL
BE
A
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
BOTH
OF
THE
JUST

UNJUST
AND
HEREIN
DO
I
EXERCISE
MYSELF
TO
HAVE
ALWAYS
A
CONSCIENCE
VOID
TO
OFFENCE
TOWARD
GOD
AND
TOWARD
MEN
NOW
AFTER

AND
OFFERINGS
WHEREUPON
CERTAIN
JEWS
FROM
ASIA
FOUND
ME
PURIFIED
IN
THE
TEMPLE
NEITHER
WITH
MULTITUDE
NOR
WITH
TUMULT
WHO
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
HERE
BEFORE
THEE
AND
OBJECT
IF
THEY
HAD
OUGHT
AGAINST
ME
OR

LET
THESE
SAME
HERE
SAY
IF
THEY
HAVE
FOUND
ANY
EVIL
DOING
IN

BE
FOR
THIS
ONE
VOICE
THAT
I
CRIED
STANDING
AMONG
THEM
TOUCHING
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
I
AM
CALLED
IN
QUESTION
BY
YOU
THIS
DAY
AND
WHEN
FELIX
HEARD
THESE
THINGS
HAVING
MORE
PERFECT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THAT
WAY
HE
DEFERRED
THEM
AND
SAID
WHEN
LYSIAS
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAIN
SHALL
COME
DOWN
I
WILL
KNOW
THE
UTTERMOST
OF
YOUR
MATTER
AND
HE
COMMANDED
A
CENTURION
TO
KEEP
PAUL
AND
TO
LET
HIM
HAVE
LIBERTY
AND
THAT
HE
SHOULD
FORBID
NONE
OF
HIS
ACQUAINTANCE
TO
MINISTER
OR
COME
UNTO
HIM
AND
AFTER
CERTAIN
DAYS
WHEN
FELIX
CAME
WITH
HIS
WIFE
DRUSILLA
WHICH
WAS
A
JEWESS
HE
SENT
FOR
PAUL
AND
HEARD
HIM
CONCERNING
THE
FAITH
IN

REASONED
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
TEMPERANCE
AND
JUDGMENT

FELIX
TREMBLED
AND
ANSWERED
GO
THY
WAY
FOR
THIS
TIME
WHEN
I
HAVE
A
CONVENIENT
SEASON
I
WILL
CALL
FOR
THEE
HE
HOPED
ALSO
THAT
MONEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
HIM
OF
PAUL
THAT
HE
MIGHT
LOOSE
HIM
WHEREFORE
HE
SENT
FOR
HIM
THE
OFTENER
AND
COMMUNED
WITH
HIM
BUT
AFTER
TWO
YEARS
PORCIUS
FESTUS
CAME
INTO
FELIX'
ROOM

FELIX
WILLING
TO
SHEW
THE
JEWS
A
PLEASURE
LEFT
PAUL
BOUND
NOW
WHEN
FESTUS
WAS
COME
INTO
THE
PROVINCE
AFTER
THREE
DAYS

ASCENDED
FROM

TO
JERUSALEM
THEN
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
AND
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
JEWS
INFORMED
HIM
AGAINST
PAUL
AND
BESOUGHT
HIM
AND
DESIRED
FAVOUR
AGAINST
HIM
THAT
HE
WOULD
SEND
FOR
HIM
TO
JERUSALEM
LAYING
WAIT
IN
THE
WAY
TO
KILL
HIM
BUT
FESTUS
ANSWERED
THAT
PAUL
SHOULD
BE
KEPT
AT
CAESAREA
AND
THAT
HE
HIMSELF
WOULD
DEPART
SHORTLY
THITHER
LET
THEM
THEREFORE
SAID
HE
WHICH
AMONG
YOU
ARE
ABLE
GO
DOWN
WITH
ME
AND
ACCUSE
THIS
MAN
IF
THERE

ANY
WICKEDNESS
IN
HIM
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
TARRIED
AMONG

MORE
THAN
TEN
DAYS
HE
WENT
DOWN
UNTO
CAESAREA
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
SITTING
ON
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
COMMANDED
PAUL
TO
BE
BROUGHT
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
COME
THE
JEWS
WHICH
CAME
DOWN
FROM
JERUSALEM
STOOD
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
LAID
MANY
AND
GRIEVOUS
COMPLAINTS
AGAINST
PAUL
WHICH
THEY
COULD
NOT
PROVE
WHILE
HE
ANSWERED
FOR
HIMSELF
NEITHER
AGAINST
THE
LAW
OF
THE
JEWS
NEITHER
AGAINST
THE
TEMPLE
NOR
YET
AGAINST
CAESAR
HAVE
I
OFFENDED
ANY
THING
AT
ALL
BUT
FESTUS
WILLING
TO
DO
THE
JEWS
A
PLEASURE
ANSWERED
PAUL
AND
SAID
WILT
THOU
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THERE
BE
JUDGED
OF
THESE
THINGS
BEFORE
ME
THEN
SAID
PAUL
I
STAND
AT
CAESAR'S
JUDGMENT
SEAT
WHERE
I
OUGHT
TO
BE
JUDGED
TO
THE
JEWS
HAVE
I
DONE
NO
WRONG
AS
THOU
VERY
WELL
KNOWEST
FOR
IF
I
BE
AN
OFFENDER
OR
HAVE
COMMITTED
ANY
THING
WORTHY
OF
DEATH
I
REFUSE
NOT
TO
DIE
BUT
IF
THERE
BE
NONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
WHEREOF
THESE
ACCUSE
ME
NO
MAN
MAY
DELIVER
ME
UNTO
THEM
I
APPEAL
UNTO

HAD
CONFERRED
WITH
THE
COUNCIL
ANSWERED
HAST
THOU
APPEALED
UNTO
CAESAR
UNTO
CAESAR
SHALT
THOU
GO
AND
AFTER
CERTAIN
DAYS
KING
AGRIPPA
AND
BERNICE
CAME
UNTO
CAESAREA
TO
SALUTE
FESTUS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
BEEN
THERE
MANY
DAYS
FESTUS
DECLARED
PAUL'S
CAUSE
UNTO
THE
KING
SAYING
THERE
IS
A
CERTAIN
MAN
LEFT
IN
BONDS
BY
FELIX
ABOUT
WHOM
WHEN
I
WAS
AT
JERUSALEM
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
THE
ELDERS
OF
THE
JEWS
INFORMED
ME
DESIRING
TO
HAVE
JUDGMENT
AGAINST
HIM
TO
WHOM
I
ANSWERED
IT
IS
NOT
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
ROMANS
TO
DELIVER
ANY
MAN
TO
DIE
BEFORE
THAT
HE
WHICH
IS
ACCUSED
HAVE
THE
ACCUSERS
FACE
TO
FACE
AND
HAVE
LICENCE
TO
ANSWER
FOR
HIMSELF
CONCERNING
THE
CRIME
LAID
AGAINST
HIM
THEREFORE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
HITHER
WITHOUT
ANY
DELAY
ON
THE
MORROW
I
SAT
ON
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
AND
COMMANDED
THE
MAN
TO
BE
BROUGHT
FORTH
AGAINST
WHOM
WHEN
THE
ACCUSERS
STOOD
UP
THEY
BROUGHT
NONE
ACCUSATION
OF
SUCH
THINGS
AS
I
SUPPOSED
BUT
HAD
CERTAIN
QUESTIONS
AGAINST
HIM
OF
THEIR
OWN
SUPERSTITION
AND
OF
ONE
JESUS
WHICH
WAS
DEAD
WHOM
PAUL
AFFIRMED
TO
BE
ALIVE
AND
BECAUSE
I
DOUBTED
OF
SUCH
MANNER
OF
QUESTIONS
I
ASKED
HIM
WHETHER
HE
WOULD
GO
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THERE
BE
JUDGED
OF
THESE
MATTERS
BUT
WHEN
PAUL
HAD
APPEALED
TO
BE
RESERVED
UNTO
THE
HEARING
OF
AUGUSTUS
I
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
BE
KEPT
TILL
I
MIGHT
SEND
HIM
TO
CAESAR
THEN
AGRIPPA
SAID
UNTO
FESTUS
I
WOULD
ALSO
HEAR
THE
MAN
MYSELF
TO
MORROW
SAID
HE
THOU
SHALT
HEAR
HIM
AND
ON
THE
MORROW
WHEN
AGRIPPA
WAS
COME
AND
BERNICE
WITH
GREAT
POMP
AND
WAS
ENTERED
INTO
THE
PLACE
OF
HEARING
WITH
THE
CHIEF
CAPTAINS
AND
PRINCIPAL
MEN
OF
THE
CITY
AT
FESTUS'
COMMANDMENT
PAUL
WAS
BROUGHT
FORTH
AND
FESTUS
SAID
KING
AGRIPPA
AND
ALL
MEN
WHICH
ARE
HERE
PRESENT
WITH
US
YE
SEE
THIS
MAN
ABOUT
WHOM
ALL
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
THE
JEWS
HAVE
DEALT
WITH
ME
BOTH
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
ALSO
HERE
CRYING
THAT
HE
OUGHT
NOT
TO
LIVE
ANY
LONGER
BUT
WHEN
I
FOUND
THAT
HE
HAD
COMMITTED
NOTHING
WORTHY
OF
DEATH
AND
THAT
HE
HIMSELF
HATH
APPEALED
TO
AUGUSTUS
I
HAVE
DETERMINED
TO
SEND
HIM
OF
WHOM
I
HAVE
NO
CERTAIN
THING
TO
WRITE
UNTO
MY
LORD
WHEREFORE
I
HAVE
BROUGHT
HIM
FORTH
BEFORE
YOU
AND
SPECIALLY
BEFORE
THEE
O
KING
AGRIPPA
THAT
AFTER
EXAMINATION
HAD
I
MIGHT
HAVE
SOMEWHAT
TO
WRITE
FOR
IT
SEEMETH
TO
ME
UNREASONABLE
TO
SEND
A
PRISONER
AND
NOT
WITHAL
TO
SIGNIFY
THE
CRIMES
LAID
AGAINST
HIM
THEN
AGRIPPA
SAID
UNTO
PAUL
THOU
ART
PERMITTED
TO
SPEAK
FOR
THYSELF
THEN
PAUL
STRETCHED
FORTH
THE
HAND
AND
ANSWERED
FOR
HIMSELF
I
THINK
MYSELF
HAPPY
KING
AGRIPPA
BECAUSE
I
SHALL
ANSWER
FOR
MYSELF
THIS
DAY
BEFORE
THEE
TOUCHING
ALL
THE
THINGS
WHEREOF
I
AM
ACCUSED
OF
THE
JEWS
ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
THEE
TO
BE
EXPERT
IN
ALL
CUSTOMS
AND
QUESTIONS
WHICH
ARE
AMONG
THE
JEWS
WHEREFORE
I
BESEECH
THEE
TO
HEAR
ME
PATIENTLY
MY
MANNER
OF
LIFE
FROM
MY
YOUTH
WHICH
WAS
AT
THE
FIRST
AMONG
MINE
OWN
NATION
AT
JERUSALEM
KNOW
ALL
THE
JEWS
WHICH
KNEW
ME
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
IF
THEY
WOULD
TESTIFY
THAT
AFTER
THE
MOST
STRAITEST
SECT
OF
OUR
RELIGION
I
LIVED
A
PHARISEE
AND
NOW
I
STAND
AND
AM
JUDGED
FOR
THE
HOPE
OF
THE
PROMISE
MADE
OF
GOD
UNTO
OUR
FATHERS
UNTO
WHICH
PROMISE
OUR
TWELVE
TRIBES
INSTANTLY
SERVING
GOD
DAY
AND
NIGHT
HOPE
TO
COME
FOR
WHICH
HOPE'S
SAKE
KING
AGRIPPA
I
AM
ACCUSED
OF
THE
JEWS
WHY
SHOULD
IT
BE
THOUGHT
A
THING
INCREDIBLE
WITH
YOU
THAT
GOD
SHOULD
RAISE
THE
DEAD
I
VERILY
THOUGHT
WITH
MYSELF
THAT
I
OUGHT
TO
DO
MANY
THINGS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
WHICH
THING
I
ALSO
DID
IN
JERUSALEM
AND
MANY
OF
THE
SAINTS
DID
I
SHUT
UP
IN
PRISON
HAVING
RECEIVED
AUTHORITY
FROM
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
PUT
TO
DEATH
I
GAVE
MY
VOICE
AGAINST
THEM
AND
I
PUNISHED
THEM
OFT
IN
EVERY
SYNAGOGUE
AND
COMPELLED
THEM
TO
BLASPHEME
AND
BEING
EXCEEDINGLY
MAD
AGAINST
THEM
I
PERSECUTED
THEM
EVEN
UNTO
STRANGE
CITIES
WHEREUPON
AS
I
WENT
TO
DAMASCUS
WITH
AUTHORITY
AND
COMMISSION
FROM
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AT
MIDDAY
O
KING
I
SAW
IN
THE
WAY
A
LIGHT
FROM
HEAVEN
ABOVE
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
THE
SUN
SHINING
ROUND
ABOUT
ME
AND
THEM
WHICH
JOURNEYED
WITH
ME
AND
WHEN
WE
WERE
ALL
FALLEN
TO
THE
EARTH
I
HEARD
A
VOICE
SPEAKING
UNTO
ME
AND
SAYING
IN
THE
HEBREW
TONGUE
SAUL
SAUL
WHY
PERSECUTEST
THOU
ME
IT
IS
HARD
FOR
THEE
TO
KICK
AGAINST
THE
PRICKS
AND
I
SAID
WHO
ART
THOU
LORD
AND
HE
SAID
I
AM
JESUS
WHOM
THOU
PERSECUTEST
BUT
RISE
AND
STAND
UPON
THY
FEET
FOR
I
HAVE
APPEARED
UNTO
THEE
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
TO
MAKE
THEE
A
MINISTER
AND
A
WITNESS
BOTH
OF
THESE
THINGS
WHICH
THOU
HAST
SEEN
AND
OF
THOSE
THINGS
IN
THE
WHICH
I
WILL
APPEAR
UNTO
THEE
DELIVERING
THEE
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
AND
FROM
THE
GENTILES
UNTO
WHOM
NOW
I
SEND
THEE
TO
OPEN
THEIR
EYES
AND
TO
TURN
THEM
FROM
DARKNESS
TO
LIGHT
AND
FROM
THE
POWER
OF
SATAN
UNTO
GOD
THAT
THEY
MAY
RECEIVE
FORGIVENESS
OF
SINS
AND
INHERITANCE
AMONG
THEM
WHICH
ARE
SANCTIFIED
BY
FAITH
THAT
IS
IN
ME
WHEREUPON
O
KING
AGRIPPA
I
WAS
NOT
DISOBEDIENT
UNTO
THE
HEAVENLY
VISION
BUT
SHEWED
FIRST
UNTO
THEM
OF
DAMASCUS
AND
AT
JERUSALEM
AND
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
COASTS
OF
JUDAEA
AND
THEN
TO
THE
GENTILES
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
REPENT
AND
TURN
TO
GOD
AND
DO
WORKS
MEET
FOR
REPENTANCE
FOR
THESE
CAUSES
THE
JEWS
CAUGHT
ME
IN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
WENT
ABOUT
TO
KILL
ME
HAVING
THEREFORE
OBTAINED
HELP
OF
GOD
I
CONTINUE
UNTO
THIS
DAY
WITNESSING
BOTH
TO
SMALL
AND
GREAT
SAYING
NONE
OTHER
THINGS
THAN
THOSE
WHICH
THE
PROPHETS
AND
MOSES
DID
SAY
SHOULD
COME
THAT
CHRIST
SHOULD
SUFFER
AND
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
THE
FIRST
THAT
SHOULD
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
SHOULD
SHEW
LIGHT
UNTO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
TO
THE
GENTILES
AND
AS
HE
THUS
SPAKE
FOR
HIMSELF
FESTUS
SAID
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
PAUL
THOU
ART
BESIDE
THYSELF
MUCH
LEARNING
DOTH
MAKE
THEE
MAD
BUT
HE
SAID
I
AM
NOT
MAD
MOST
NOBLE
FESTUS
BUT
SPEAK
FORTH
THE
WORDS
OF
TRUTH
AND
SOBERNESS
FOR
THE
KING
KNOWETH
OF
THESE
THINGS
BEFORE
WHOM
ALSO
I
SPEAK
FREELY
FOR
I
AM
PERSUADED
THAT
NONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
ARE
HIDDEN
FROM
HIM
FOR
THIS
THING
WAS
NOT
DONE
IN
A
CORNER
KING
AGRIPPA
BELIEVEST
THOU
THE
PROPHETS
I
KNOW
THAT
THOU
BELIEVEST
THEN
AGRIPPA
SAID
UNTO
PAUL
ALMOST
THOU
PERSUADEST
ME
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
AND
PAUL
SAID
I
WOULD
TO
GOD
THAT
NOT
ONLY
THOU
BUT
ALSO
ALL
THAT
HEAR
ME
THIS
DAY
WERE
BOTH
ALMOST
AND
ALTOGETHER
SUCH
AS
I
AM
EXCEPT
THESE
BONDS
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
THUS
SPOKEN
THE
KING
ROSE
UP
AND
THE
GOVERNOR
AND
BERNICE
AND
THEY
THAT
SAT
WITH
THEM
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GONE
ASIDE
THEY
TALKED
BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
SAYING
THIS
MAN
DOETH
NOTHING
WORTHY
OF
DEATH
OR
OF
BONDS
THEN
SAID
AGRIPPA
UNTO
FESTUS
THIS
MAN
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
SET
AT
LIBERTY
IF
HE
HAD
NOT
APPEALED
UNTO
CAESAR
AND
WHEN
IT
WAS
DETERMINED
THAT
WE
SHOULD
SAIL
INTO
ITALY
THEY
DELIVERED
PAUL
AND
CERTAIN
OTHER
PRISONERS
UNTO
ONE
NAMED
JULIUS
A
CENTURION
OF
AUGUSTUS'
BAND
AND
ENTERING
INTO
A
SHIP
OF
ADRAMYTTIUM
WE
LAUNCHED
MEANING
TO
SAIL
BY
THE
COASTS
OF
ASIA
ONE
ARISTARCHUS
A
MACEDONIAN
OF
THESSALONICA
BEING
WITH
US
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
WE
TOUCHED
AT
SIDON
AND
JULIUS
COURTEOUSLY
ENTREATED
PAUL
AND
GAVE
HIM
LIBERTY
TO
GO
UNTO
HIS
FRIENDS
TO
REFRESH
HIMSELF
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
LAUNCHED
FROM
THENCE
WE
SAILED
UNDER
CYPRUS
BECAUSE
THE
WINDS
WERE
CONTRARY
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
SAILED
OVER
THE
SEA
OF
CILICIA
AND
PAMPHYLIA
WE
CAME
TO
MYRA
A
CITY
OF
LYCIA
AND
THERE
THE
CENTURION
FOUND
A
SHIP
OF
ALEXANDRIA
SAILING
INTO
ITALY
AND
HE
PUT
US
THEREIN
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
SAILED
SLOWLY
MANY
DAYS
AND
SCARCE
WERE
COME
OVER
AGAINST
CNIDUS
THE
WIND
NOT
SUFFERING
US
WE
SAILED
UNDER
CRETE
OVER
AGAINST
SALMONE
AND
HARDLY
PASSING
IT
CAME
UNTO
A
PLACE
WHICH
IS
CALLED
THE
FAIR
HAVENS
NIGH
WHEREUNTO
WAS
THE
CITY
OF
LASEA
NOW
WHEN
MUCH
TIME
WAS
SPENT
AND
WHEN
SAILING
WAS
NOW
DANGEROUS
BECAUSE
THE
FAST
WAS
NOW
ALREADY
PAST
PAUL
ADMONISHED
THEM
AND
SAID
UNTO
THEM
SIRS
I
PERCEIVE
THAT
THIS
VOYAGE
WILL
BE
WITH
HURT
AND
MUCH
DAMAGE
NOT
ONLY
OF
THE
LADING
AND
SHIP
BUT
ALSO
OF
OUR
LIVES
NEVERTHELESS
THE
CENTURION
BELIEVED
THE
MASTER
AND
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
SHIP
MORE
THAN
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
BY
PAUL
AND
BECAUSE
THE
HAVEN
WAS
NOT
COMMODIOUS
TO
WINTER
IN
THE
MORE
PART
ADVISED
TO
DEPART
THENCE
ALSO
IF
BY
ANY
MEANS
THEY
MIGHT
ATTAIN
TO
PHENICE
AND
THERE
TO
WINTER
WHICH
IS
AN
HAVEN
OF
CRETE
AND
LIETH
TOWARD
THE
SOUTH
WEST
AND
NORTH
WEST
AND
WHEN
THE
SOUTH
WIND
BLEW
SOFTLY
SUPPOSING
THAT
THEY
HAD
OBTAINED
THEIR
PURPOSE
LOOSING
THENCE
THEY
SAILED
CLOSE
BY
CRETE
BUT
NOT
LONG
AFTER
THERE
AROSE
AGAINST
IT
A
TEMPESTUOUS
WIND
CALLED
EUROCLYDON
AND
WHEN
THE
SHIP
WAS
CAUGHT
AND
COULD
NOT
BEAR
UP
INTO
THE
WIND
WE
LET
HER
DRIVE
AND
RUNNING
UNDER
A
CERTAIN
ISLAND
WHICH
IS
CALLED
CLAUDA
WE
HAD
MUCH
WORK
TO
COME
BY
THE
BOAT
WHICH
WHEN
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
UP
THEY
USED
HELPS
UNDERGIRDING
THE
SHIP
AND
FEARING
LEST
THEY
SHOULD
FALL
INTO
THE
QUICKSANDS
STRAKE
SAIL
AND
SO
WERE
DRIVEN
AND
WE
BEING
EXCEEDINGLY
TOSSED
WITH
A
TEMPEST
THE
NEXT
DAY
THEY
LIGHTENED
THE
SHIP
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
WE
CAST
OUT
WITH
OUR
OWN
HANDS
THE
TACKLING
OF
THE
SHIP
AND
WHEN
NEITHER
SUN
NOR
STARS
IN
MANY
DAYS
APPEARED
AND
NO
SMALL
TEMPEST
LAY
ON
US
ALL
HOPE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
SAVED
WAS
THEN
TAKEN
AWAY
BUT
AFTER
LONG
ABSTINENCE
PAUL
STOOD
FORTH
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEM
AND
SAID
SIRS
YE
SHOULD
HAVE
HEARKENED
UNTO
ME
AND
NOT
HAVE
LOOSED
FROM
CRETE
AND
TO
HAVE
GAINED
THIS
HARM
AND
LOSS
AND
NOW
I
EXHORT
YOU
TO
BE
OF
GOOD
CHEER
FOR
THERE
SHALL
BE
NO
LOSS
OF
ANY
MAN'S
LIFE
AMONG
YOU
BUT
OF
THE
SHIP
FOR
THERE
STOOD
BY
ME
THIS
NIGHT
THE
ANGEL
OF
GOD
WHOSE
I
AM
AND
WHOM
I
SERVE
SAYING
FEAR
NOT
PAUL
THOU
MUST
BE
BROUGHT
BEFORE
CAESAR
AND
LO
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
THEE
ALL
THEM
THAT
SAIL
WITH
THEE
WHEREFORE
SIRS
BE
OF
GOOD
CHEER
FOR
I
BELIEVE
GOD
THAT
IT
SHALL
BE
EVEN
AS
IT
WAS
TOLD
ME
HOWBEIT
WE
MUST
BE
CAST
UPON
A
CERTAIN
ISLAND
BUT
WHEN
THE
FOURTEENTH
NIGHT
WAS
COME
AS
WE
WERE
DRIVEN
UP
AND
DOWN
IN
ADRIA
ABOUT
MIDNIGHT
THE
SHIPMEN
DEEMED
THAT
THEY
DREW
NEAR
TO
SOME
COUNTRY
AND
SOUNDED
AND
FOUND
IT
TWENTY
FATHOMS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
GONE
A
LITTLE
FURTHER
THEY
SOUNDED
AGAIN
AND
FOUND
IT
FIFTEEN
FATHOMS
THEN
FEARING
LEST
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
FALLEN
UPON
ROCKS
THEY
CAST
FOUR
ANCHORS
OUT
OF
THE
STERN
AND
WISHED
FOR
THE
DAY
AND
AS
THE
SHIPMEN
WERE
ABOUT
TO
FLEE
OUT
OF
THE
SHIP
WHEN
THEY
HAD
LET
DOWN
THE
BOAT
INTO
THE
SEA
UNDER
COLOUR
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
CAST
ANCHORS
OUT
OF
THE
FORESHIP
PAUL
SAID
TO
THE
CENTURION
AND
TO
THE
SOLDIERS
EXCEPT
THESE
ABIDE
IN
THE
SHIP
YE
CANNOT
BE
SAVED
THEN
THE
SOLDIERS
CUT
OFF
THE
ROPES
OF
THE
BOAT
AND
LET
HER
FALL
OFF
AND
WHILE
THE
DAY
WAS
COMING
ON
PAUL
BESOUGHT
THEM
ALL
TO
TAKE
MEAT
SAYING
THIS
DAY
IS
THE
FOURTEENTH
DAY
THAT
YE
HAVE
TARRIED
AND
CONTINUED
FASTING
HAVING
TAKEN
NOTHING
WHEREFORE
I
PRAY
YOU
TO
TAKE
SOME
MEAT
FOR
THIS
IS
FOR
YOUR
HEALTH
FOR
THERE
SHALL
NOT
AN
HAIR
FALL
FROM
THE
HEAD
OF
ANY
OF
YOU
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
THUS
SPOKEN
HE
TOOK
BREAD
AND
GAVE
THANKS
TO
GOD
IN
PRESENCE
OF
THEM
ALL
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
BROKEN
IT
HE
BEGAN
TO
EAT
THEN
WERE
THEY
ALL
OF
GOOD
CHEER
AND
THEY
ALSO
TOOK
SOME
MEAT
AND
WE
WERE
IN
ALL
IN
THE
SHIP
TWO
HUNDRED
THREESCORE
AND
SIXTEEN
SOULS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
EATEN
ENOUGH
THEY
LIGHTENED
THE
SHIP
AND
CAST
OUT
THE
WHEAT
INTO
THE
SEA
AND
WHEN
IT
WAS
DAY
THEY
KNEW
NOT
THE
LAND
BUT
THEY
DISCOVERED
A
CERTAIN
CREEK
WITH
A
SHORE
INTO
THE
WHICH
THEY
WERE
MINDED
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
TO
THRUST
IN
THE
SHIP
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
UP
THE
ANCHORS
THEY
COMMITTED
THEMSELVES
UNTO
THE
SEA
AND
LOOSED
THE
RUDDER
BANDS
AND
HOISED
UP
THE
MAINSAIL
TO
THE
WIND
AND
MADE
TOWARD
SHORE
AND
FALLING
INTO
A
PLACE
WHERE
TWO
SEAS
MET
THEY
RAN
THE
SHIP
AGROUND
AND
THE
FOREPART
STUCK
FAST
AND
REMAINED
UNMOVEABLE
BUT
THE
HINDER
PART
WAS
BROKEN
WITH
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
THE
WAVES
AND
THE
SOLDIERS'
COUNSEL
WAS
TO
KILL
THE
PRISONERS
LEST
ANY
OF
THEM
SHOULD
SWIM
OUT
AND
ESCAPE
BUT
THE
CENTURION
WILLING
TO
SAVE
PAUL
KEPT
THEM
FROM
THEIR
PURPOSE
AND
COMMANDED
THAT
THEY
WHICH
COULD
SWIM
SHOULD
CAST
THEMSELVES
FIRST
INTO
THE
SEA
AND
GET
TO
LAND
AND
THE
REST
SOME
ON
BOARDS
AND
SOME
ON
BROKEN
PIECES
OF
THE
SHIP
AND
SO
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
THEY
ESCAPED
ALL
SAFE
TO
LAND
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ESCAPED
THEN
THEY
KNEW
THAT
THE
ISLAND
WAS
CALLED
MELITA
AND
THE
BARBAROUS
PEOPLE
SHEWED
US
NO
LITTLE
KINDNESS
FOR
THEY
KINDLED
A
FIRE
AND
RECEIVED
US
EVERY
ONE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
RAIN
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THE
COLD
AND
WHEN
PAUL
HAD
GATHERED
A
BUNDLE
OF
STICKS
AND
LAID
THEM
ON
THE
FIRE
THERE
CAME
A
VIPER
OUT
OF
THE
HEAT
AND
FASTENED
ON
HIS
HAND
AND
WHEN
THE
BARBARIANS
SAW
THE
VENOMOUS
BEAST
HANG
ON
HIS
HAND
THEY
SAID
AMONG
THEMSELVES
NO
DOUBT
THIS
MAN
IS
A
MURDERER
WHOM
THOUGH
HE
HATH
ESCAPED
THE
SEA
YET
VENGEANCE
SUFFERETH
NOT
TO
LIVE
AND
HE
SHOOK
OFF
THE
BEAST
INTO
THE
FIRE
AND
FELT
NO
HARM
HOWBEIT
THEY
LOOKED
WHEN
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
SWOLLEN
OR
FALLEN
DOWN
DEAD
SUDDENLY
BUT
AFTER
THEY
HAD
LOOKED
A
GREAT
WHILE
AND
SAW
NO
HARM
COME
TO
HIM
THEY
CHANGED
THEIR
MINDS
AND
SAID
THAT
HE
WAS
A
GOD
IN
THE
SAME
QUARTERS
WERE
POSSESSIONS
OF
THE
CHIEF
MAN
OF
THE
ISLAND
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
PUBLIUS
WHO
RECEIVED
US
AND
LODGED
US
THREE
DAYS
COURTEOUSLY
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
THE
FATHER
OF
PUBLIUS
LAY
SICK
OF
A
FEVER
AND
OF
A
BLOODY
FLUX
TO
WHOM
PAUL
ENTERED
IN
AND
PRAYED
AND
LAID
HIS
HANDS
ON
HIM
AND
HEALED
HIM
SO
WHEN
THIS
WAS
DONE
OTHERS
ALSO
WHICH
HAD
DISEASES
IN
THE
ISLAND
CAME
AND
WERE
HEALED
WHO
ALSO
HONOURED
US
WITH
MANY
HONOURS
AND
WHEN
WE
DEPARTED
THEY
LADED
US
WITH
SUCH
THINGS
AS
WERE
NECESSARY
AND
AFTER
THREE
MONTHS
WE
DEPARTED
IN
A
SHIP
OF
ALEXANDRIA
WHICH
HAD
WINTERED
IN
THE
ISLE
WHOSE
SIGN
WAS
CASTOR
AND
POLLUX
AND
LANDING
AT
SYRACUSE
WE
TARRIED
THERE
THREE
DAYS
AND
FROM
THENCE
WE
FETCHED
A
COMPASS
AND
CAME
TO
RHEGIUM
AND
AFTER
ONE
DAY
THE
SOUTH
WIND
BLEW
AND
WE
CAME
THE
NEXT
DAY
TO
PUTEOLI
WHERE
WE
FOUND
BRETHREN
AND
WERE
DESIRED
TO
TARRY
WITH
THEM
SEVEN
DAYS
AND
SO
WE
WENT
TOWARD
ROME
AND
FROM
THENCE
WHEN
THE
BRETHREN
HEARD
OF
US
THEY
CAME
TO
MEET
US
AS
FAR
AS
APPII
FORUM
AND
THE
THREE
TAVERNS
WHOM
WHEN
PAUL
SAW
HE
THANKED
GOD
AND
TOOK
COURAGE
AND
WHEN
WE
CAME
TO
ROME
THE
CENTURION
DELIVERED
THE
PRISONERS
TO
THE
CAPTAIN
OF
THE
GUARD
BUT
PAUL
WAS
SUFFERED
TO
DWELL
BY
HIMSELF
WITH
A
SOLDIER
THAT
KEPT
HIM
AND
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
AFTER
THREE
DAYS
PAUL
CALLED
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
JEWS
TOGETHER
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
TOGETHER
HE
SAID
UNTO
THEM
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
THOUGH
I
HAVE
COMMITTED
NOTHING
AGAINST
THE
PEOPLE
OR
CUSTOMS
OF
OUR
FATHERS
YET
WAS
I
DELIVERED
PRISONER
FROM
JERUSALEM
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
ROMANS
WHO
WHEN
THEY
HAD
EXAMINED
ME
WOULD
HAVE
LET
ME
GO
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NO
CAUSE
OF
DEATH
IN
ME
BUT
WHEN
THE
JEWS
SPAKE
AGAINST
IT
I
WAS
CONSTRAINED
TO
APPEAL
UNTO
CAESAR
NOT
THAT
I
HAD
OUGHT
TO
ACCUSE
MY
NATION
OF
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
THEREFORE
HAVE
I
CALLED
FOR
YOU
TO
SEE
YOU
AND
TO
SPEAK
WITH
YOU
BECAUSE
THAT
FOR
THE
HOPE
OF
ISRAEL
I
AM
BOUND
WITH
THIS
CHAIN
AND
THEY
SAID
UNTO
HIM
WE
NEITHER
RECEIVED
LETTERS
OUT
OF
JUDAEA
CONCERNING
THEE
NEITHER
ANY
OF
THE
BRETHREN
THAT
CAME
SHEWED
OR
SPAKE
ANY
HARM
OF
THEE
BUT
WE
DESIRE
TO
HEAR
OF
THEE
WHAT
THOU
THINKEST
FOR
AS
CONCERNING
THIS
SECT
WE
KNOW
THAT
EVERY
WHERE
IT
IS
SPOKEN
AGAINST
AND
WHEN
THEY
HAD
APPOINTED
HIM
A
DAY
THERE
CAME
MANY
TO
HIM
INTO
HIS
LODGING
TO
WHOM
HE
EXPOUNDED
AND
TESTIFIED
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
PERSUADING
THEM
CONCERNING
JESUS
BOTH
OUT
OF
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
AND
OUT
OF
THE
PROPHETS
FROM
MORNING
TILL
EVENING
AND
SOME
BELIEVED
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
AND
SOME
BELIEVED
NOT
AND
WHEN
THEY
AGREED
NOT
AMONG
THEMSELVES
THEY
DEPARTED
AFTER
THAT
PAUL
HAD
SPOKEN
ONE
WORD
WELL
SPAKE
THE
HOLY
GHOST
BY
ESAIAS
THE
PROPHET
UNTO
OUR
FATHERS
SAYING
GO
UNTO
THIS
PEOPLE
AND
SAY
HEARING
YE
SHALL
HEAR
AND
SHALL
NOT
UNDERSTAND
AND
SEEING
YE
SHALL
SEE
AND
NOT
PERCEIVE
FOR
THE
HEART
OF
THIS
PEOPLE
IS
WAXED
GROSS
AND
THEIR
EARS
ARE
DULL
OF
HEARING
AND
THEIR
EYES
HAVE
THEY
CLOSED
LEST
THEY
SHOULD
SEE
WITH
THEIR
EYES
AND
HEAR
WITH
THEIR
EARS
AND
UNDERSTAND
WITH
THEIR
HEART
AND
SHOULD
BE
CONVERTED
AND
I
SHOULD
HEAL
THEM
BE
IT
KNOWN
THEREFORE
UNTO
YOU
THAT
THE
SALVATION
OF
GOD
IS
SENT
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
THAT
THEY
WILL
HEAR
IT
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
SAID
THESE
WORDS
THE
JEWS
DEPARTED
AND
HAD
GREAT
REASONING
AMONG
THEMSELVES
AND
PAUL
DWELT
TWO
WHOLE
YEARS
IN
HIS
OWN
HIRED
HOUSE
AND
RECEIVED
ALL
THAT
CAME
IN
UNTO
HIM
PREACHING
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
TEACHING
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
CONCERN
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
WITH
ALL
CONFIDENCE
NO
MAN
FORBIDDING
HIM
PAUL
A
SERVANT
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
CALLED
TO
BE
AN
APOSTLE
SEPARATED
UNTO
THE
GOSPEL
OF
GOD
WHICH
HE
HAD
PROMISED
AFORE
BY
HIS
PROPHETS
IN
THE
HOLY
SCRIPTURES
CONCERNING
HIS
SON
JESUS
CHRIST
OUR
LORD
WHICH
WAS
MADE
OF
THE
SEED
OF
DAVID
ACCORDING
TO
THE
FLESH
AND
DECLARED
TO
BE
THE
SON
OF
GOD
WITH
POWER
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SPIRIT
OF
HOLINESS
BY
THE
RESURRECTION
FROM
THE
DEAD
BY
WHOM
WE
HAVE

FOR
THE

OF

IS
REVEALED
FROM
HEAVEN
AGAINST
ALL
UNGODLINESS
AND
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
MEN
WHO
HOLD
THE
TRUTH
IN
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
BECAUSE
THAT
WHICH
MAY
BE
KNOWN
OF
GOD
IS
MANIFEST
IN
THEM
FOR
GOD
HATH
SHEWED
IT
UNTO
THEM
FOR
THE
INVISIBLE
THINGS
OF
HIM
FROM
THE

OF
THE
WORLD
ARE
CLEARLY
SEEN
BEING
UNDERSTOOD
BY
THE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
MADE
EVEN
HIS
ETERNAL
POWER
AND
GODHEAD
SO
THAT
THEY
ARE
WITHOUT
EXCUSE
BECAUSE
THAT
WHEN
THEY
KNEW
GOD
THEY
GLORIFIED
HIM
NOT
AS
GOD
NEITHER
WERE
THANKFUL
BUT
BECAME
VAIN
IN
THEIR
IMAGINATIONS
AND
THEIR
FOOLISH
HEART
WAS
DARKENED
PROFESSING
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
WISE
THEY
BECAME
FOOLS
AND
CHANGED
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
UNCORRUPTIBLE
GOD
INTO
AN
IMAGE
MADE
LIKE
TO
CORRUPTIBLE
MAN
AND
TO
BIRDS
AND
FOURFOOTED

WHEREFORE
GOD
ALSO
GAVE
THEM
UP
TO
UNCLEANNESS
THROUGH
THE
LUSTS
OF
THEIR
OWN
HEARTS
TO
DISHONOUR
THEIR

BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
WHO
CHANGED
THE

AND
WORSHIPPED
AND
SERVED
THE

MORE
THAN
THE

WHO
IS
BLESSED
FOR
EVER
AMEN
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
GOD
GAVE
THEM
UP
UNTO
VILE
AFFECTIONS
FOR
EVEN
THEIR

DID
CHANGE
THE
NATURAL
USE
INTO
THAT
WHICH
IS
AGAINST

AND
LIKEWISE
ALSO
THE

LEAVING
THE

OF
THE

BURNED
IN

WITH

WHICH
IS
UNSEEMLY

OF

WHICH
WAS
MEET
AND
EVEN
AS
THEY
DID
NOT

TO

IN

GOD
GAVE
THEM
OVER
TO
A
REPROBATE
MIND
TO
DO
THOSE

WHICH
ARE

WITH
ALL

WHOSE

THEN
ARE

NO
IN
NO

FOR
WE
HAVE
BEFORE
PROVED

THAT
THEY
ARE

AS
IT
IS

THERE
IS
NONE
RIGHTEOUS
NO
NOT

THERE
IS

THAT
UNDERSTANDETH
THERE
IS
NONE
THAT
SEEKETH
AFTER
GOD
THEY
ARE
ALL
GONE
OUT
OF
THE

THEY
ARE
TOGETHER
BECOME
UNPROFITABLE
THERE
IS
NONE
THAT
DOETH

NO
NOT

THEIR

IS
AN
OPEN
SEPULCHRE
WITH
THEIR
TONGUES
THEY
HAVE

DECEIT
THE

OF

IS
UNDER
THEIR

WHOSE
MOUTH
IS
FULL
OF
CURSING
AND
BITTERNESS
THEIR
FEET
ARE
SWIFT
TO
SHED
BLOOD
DESTRUCTION
AND
MISERY
ARE
IN
THEIR
WAYS
AND
THE
WAY
OF
PEACE
HAVE
THEY
NOT
KNOWN
THERE
IS
NO
FEAR
OF
GOD
BEFORE
THEIR

NOW
WE
KNOW
THAT
WHAT
THINGS
SOEVER
THE
LAW
SAITH
IT
SAITH
TO
THEM
WHO
ARE
UNDER
THE
LAW
THAT
EVERY
MOUTH
MAY
BE
STOPPED
AND
ALL
THE
WORLD
MAY
BECOME
GUILTY
BEFORE
GOD
THEREFORE
BY
THE
DEEDS
OF
THE
LAW
THERE
SHALL
NO
FLESH
BE
JUSTIFIED
IN
HIS
SIGHT
FOR
BY
THE
LAW
IS
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SIN
BUT
NOW
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
WITHOUT
THE
LAW
IS
MANIFESTED
BEING
WITNESSED
BY
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
EVEN
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
WHICH
IS
BY
FAITH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
UNTO
ALL
AND
UPON
ALL
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
FOR
ALL
HAVE
SINNED
AND
COME
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
BEING
JUSTIFIED
FREELY
BY
HIS
GRACE
THROUGH
THE
REDEMPTION
THAT
IS
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
WHOM
GOD
HATH
SET
FORTH
TO
BE
A
PROPITIATION
THROUGH
FAITH
IN
HIS
BLOOD
TO
DECLARE
HIS
RIGHTEOUSNESS
FOR
THE
REMISSION
OF
SINS
THAT
ARE
PAST
THROUGH
THE
FORBEARANCE
OF
GOD
TO
DECLARE
I
SAY
AT
THIS
TIME
HIS
RIGHTEOUSNESS
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
JUST
AND
THE
JUSTIFIER
OF
HIM
WHICH
BELIEVETH
IN
JESUS
WHERE
IS
BOASTING
THEN
IT
IS
EXCLUDED
BY
WHAT
LAW
OF
WORKS
NAY
BUT
BY
THE
LAW
OF
FAITH
THEREFORE
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
A
MAN
IS
JUSTIFIED
BY
FAITH
WITHOUT
THE
DEEDS
OF
THE
LAW
IS
HE
THE
GOD
OF
THE
JEWS
ONLY
IS
HE
NOT
ALSO
OF
THE
GENTILES
YES
OF
THE
GENTILES
ALSO
SEEING
IT
IS
ONE
GOD
WHICH
SHALL
JUSTIFY
THE
CIRCUMCISION
BY
FAITH
AND
UNCIRCUMCISION
THROUGH
FAITH
DO
WE
THEN
MAKE
VOID
THE
LAW
THROUGH
FAITH
GOD
FORBID
YEA
WE
ESTABLISH
THE
LAW
WHAT
SHALL
WE
SAY
THEN
THAT
ABRAHAM
OUR
FATHER
AS
PERTAINING
TO
THE
FLESH
HATH
FOUND
FOR
IF
ABRAHAM
WERE
JUSTIFIED
BY
WORKS
HE
HATH
WHEREOF
TO
GLORY
BUT
NOT
BEFORE
GOD
FOR
WHAT
SAITH
THE
SCRIPTURE
ABRAHAM
BELIEVED
GOD
AND
IT
WAS
COUNTED
UNTO
HIM
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
NOW
TO
HIM
THAT
WORKETH
IS
THE
REWARD
NOT
RECKONED
OF
GRACE
BUT
OF
DEBT
BUT
TO
HIM
THAT
WORKETH
NOT
BUT
BELIEVETH
ON
HIM
THAT
JUSTIFIETH
THE
UNGODLY
HIS
FAITH
IS
COUNTED
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
EVEN
AS
DAVID
ALSO
DESCRIBETH
THE
BLESSEDNESS
OF
THE
MAN
UNTO
WHOM
GOD
IMPUTETH
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WITHOUT
WORKS
SAYING
BLESSED
ARE
THEY
WHOSE
INIQUITIES
ARE
FORGIVEN
AND
WHOSE
SINS
ARE
COVERED
BLESSED
IS
THE
MAN
TO
WHOM
THE
LORD
WILL
NOT
IMPUTE
SIN
COMETH
THIS
BLESSEDNESS
THEN
UPON
THE
CIRCUMCISION
ONLY
OR
UPON
THE
UNCIRCUMCISION
ALSO
FOR
WE
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WAS
RECKONED
TO
ABRAHAM
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
HOW
WAS
IT
THEN
RECKONED
WHEN
HE
WAS
IN
CIRCUMCISION
OR
IN
UNCIRCUMCISION
NOT
IN
CIRCUMCISION
BUT
IN
UNCIRCUMCISION
AND
HE
RECEIVED
THE
SIGN
OF
CIRCUMCISION
A
SEAL
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE
FAITH
WHICH
HE
HAD
YET
BEING
UNCIRCUMCISED
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
THE
FATHER
OF
ALL
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
THOUGH
THEY
BE
NOT
CIRCUMCISED
THAT
RIGHTEOUSNESS
MIGHT
BE
IMPUTED
UNTO
THEM
ALSO
AND
THE
FATHER
OF
CIRCUMCISION
TO
THEM
WHO
ARE
NOT
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
ONLY
BUT
WHO
ALSO
WALK
IN
THE
STEPS
OF
THAT
FAITH
OF
OUR
FATHER
ABRAHAM
WHICH
HE
HAD
BEING
YET
UNCIRCUMCISED
FOR
THE
PROMISE
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
THE
HEIR
OF
THE
WORLD
WAS
NOT
TO
ABRAHAM
OR
TO
HIS
SEED
THROUGH
THE
LAW
BUT
THROUGH
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
FAITH
FOR
IF
THEY
WHICH
ARE
OF
THE
LAW
BE
HEIRS
FAITH
IS
MADE
VOID
AND
THE
PROMISE
MADE
OF
NONE
EFFECT
BECAUSE
THE
LAW
WORKETH
WRATH
FOR
WHERE
NO
LAW
IS
THERE
IS
NO
TRANSGRESSION
THEREFORE
IT
IS
OF
FAITH
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
BY
GRACE
TO
THE
END
THE
PROMISE
MIGHT
BE
SURE
TO
ALL
THE
SEED
NOT
TO
THAT
ONLY
WHICH
IS
OF
THE
LAW
BUT
TO
THAT
ALSO
WHICH
IS
OF
THE
FAITH
OF
ABRAHAM
WHO
IS
THE
FATHER
OF
US
ALL
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
I
HAVE
MADE
THEE
A
FATHER
OF
MANY
NATIONS
BEFORE
HIM
WHOM
HE
BELIEVED
EVEN
GOD
WHO
QUICKENETH
THE
DEAD
AND
CALLETH
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
BE
NOT
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
WHO
AGAINST
HOPE
BELIEVED
IN
HOPE
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BECOME
THE
FATHER
OF
MANY
NATIONS
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
WHICH
WAS
SPOKEN
SO
SHALL
THY
SEED
BE
AND
BEING
NOT
WEAK
IN
FAITH
HE
CONSIDERED
NOT
HIS
OWN
BODY
NOW
DEAD
WHEN
HE
WAS
ABOUT
AN
HUNDRED
YEARS
OLD
NEITHER
YET
THE
DEADNESS
OF
SARAH'S
WOMB
HE
STAGGERED
NOT
AT
THE
PROMISE
OF
GOD
THROUGH
UNBELIEF
BUT
WAS
STRONG
IN
FAITH
GIVING
GLORY
TO
GOD
AND
BEING
FULLY
PERSUADED
THAT
WHAT
HE
HAD
PROMISED
HE
WAS
ABLE
ALSO
TO
PERFORM
AND
THEREFORE
IT
WAS
IMPUTED
TO
HIM
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
NOW
IT
WAS
NOT
WRITTEN
FOR
HIS
SAKE
ALONE
THAT
IT
WAS
IMPUTED
TO
HIM
BUT
FOR
US
ALSO
TO
WHOM
IT
SHALL
BE
IMPUTED
IF
WE
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
THAT
RAISED
UP
JESUS
OUR
LORD
FROM
THE
DEAD
WHO
WAS
DELIVERED
FOR
OUR
OFFENCES
AND
WAS
RAISED
AGAIN
FOR
OUR
JUSTIFICATION
THEREFORE
BEING
JUSTIFIED
BY
FAITH
WE
HAVE
PEACE
WITH
GOD
THROUGH
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
BY
WHOM
ALSO
WE
HAVE
ACCESS
BY
FAITH
INTO
THIS
GRACE
WHEREIN
WE
STAND
AND
REJOICE
IN
HOPE
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
AND
NOT
ONLY
SO
BUT
WE
GLORY
IN
TRIBULATIONS
ALSO
KNOWING
THAT
TRIBULATION
WORKETH
PATIENCE
AND
PATIENCE
EXPERIENCE
AND
EXPERIENCE
HOPE
AND
HOPE
MAKETH
NOT
ASHAMED
BECAUSE
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
IS
SHED
ABROAD
IN
OUR
HEARTS
BY
THE
HOLY
GHOST
WHICH
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
US
FOR

GOD
COMMENDETH
HIS

IN

WHILE
WE

HATH
ABOUNDED
UNTO

SO
IS
THE

EVEN
SO
MIGHT
GRACE
REIGN
THROUGH

UNTO
ETERNAL

THAT
LIKE
AS

UP
FROM

BY

THAT

IS
FREED

NOW
IF

WE

NO

THEREOF
NEITHER

SHALL
NOT

FOR
YE
ARE

WHAT
THEN
SHALL
WE
SIN
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
NOT

FOR
WHEN

THEN
IN

BUT
IF
THE
HUSBAND
BE

SHE
IS
LOOSED
FROM

SO
THEN
IF
WHILE
HER
HUSBAND
LIVETH
SHE

SHE

BE
CALLED
AN
ADULTERESS
BUT
IF

SHE
IS
FREE

SO
THAT
SHE
IS
NO

WHEREFORE
MY

THAT
YE
SHOULD
BE
MARRIED

EVEN
TO

WHO
IS

THAT

FOR

THE
MOTIONS
OF

WHICH
WERE
BY

DID
WORK
IN
OUR

TO
BRING

BUT
NOW
WE
ARE

THAT
WE
SHOULD

IN
NEWNESS
OF

OF

WE
SAY
THEN
IS
THE

SIN
GOD
FORBID
NAY
I
HAD
NOT

SIN
BUT
BY

FOR
I
HAD
NOT

LUST
EXCEPT
THE

HAD
SAID
THOU
SHALT

BY
THE

WROUGHT
IN

ALL
MANNER

FOR
WITHOUT

SIN
WAS

AND
THE

I
FOUND
TO
BE
UNTO

FOR
SIN
TAKING
OCCASION
BY

AND
BY
IT
SLEW
ME
WHEREFORE
THE

IS
HOLY
AND
THE

HOLY
AND
JUST

GOOD
WAS
THEN
THAT
WHICH
IS

MADE
DEATH
UNTO

SIN
WORKING
DEATH
IN

BY
THAT
WHICH
IS

THAT
SIN
BY

MIGHT
BECOME
EXCEEDING
SINFUL
FOR
WE

IS
SPIRITUAL
BUT
I
AM
CARNAL
SOLD
UNDER
SIN
FOR
THAT
WHICH
I
DO
I
ALLOW
NOT
FOR
WHAT
I

THAT
DO
I
NOT

WHAT
I

I
IF
THEN
I
DO
THAT
WHICH
I

NOT
I
CONSENT
UNTO
THE

THAT

NO

I

IS

FOR
I
DELIGHT
IN

I
SEE
ANOTHER

IN
MY

WARRING
AGAINST
THE
LAW
OF
MY

AND
BRINGING
ME
INTO
CAPTIVITY
TO
THE
LAW
OF

WHICH
IS
IN
MY

O
WRETCHED
MAN
THAT
I
AM
WHO
SHALL
DELIVER
ME
FROM
THE

OF
THIS
DEATH
I
THANK
GOD
THROUGH
JESUS
CHRIST
OUR

SO
THEN
WITH
THE
MIND
I
MYSELF
SERVE
THE
LAW
OF
GOD
BUT
WITH
THE
FLESH
THE
LAW
OF
SIN
THERE
IS
THEREFORE
NOW
NO
CONDEMNATION
TO
THEM
WHICH
ARE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
WHO
WALK
NOT
AFTER
THE

BUT
AFTER
THE

FOR
THE
LAW
OF
THE
SPIRIT
OF
LIFE
IN

JESUS
HATH
MADE
ME
FREE
FROM
THE

OF
SIN
AND
DEATH
FOR
WHAT
THE

COULD
NOT
DO
IN
THAT
IT
WAS
WEAK
THROUGH
THE
FLESH
GOD
SENDING
HIS
OWN
SON
IN
THE
LIKENESS
OF
SINFUL
FLESH
AND
FOR
SIN
CONDEMNED
SIN
IN
THE
FLESH
THAT
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE
LAW
MIGHT
BE
FULFILLED
IN
US
WHO
WALK
NOT
AFTER
THE
FLESH
BUT
AFTER
THE
SPIRIT
FOR
THEY
THAT
ARE
AFTER
THE
FLESH
DO
MIND
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
FLESH
BUT
THEY
THAT
ARE
AFTER
THE
SPIRIT
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
FOR
TO
BE
CARNALLY
MINDED
IS
DEATH
BUT
TO
BE
SPIRITUALLY
MINDED
IS
LIFE
AND
PEACE
BECAUSE
THE
CARNAL
MIND
IS
ENMITY
AGAINST
GOD
FOR
IT
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
THE
LAW
OF
GOD
NEITHER
INDEED
CAN
BE
SO
THEN
THEY
THAT
ARE
IN
THE
FLESH
CANNOT
PLEASE
GOD
BUT
YE
ARE
NOT
IN
THE

BUT
IN
THE

IF
SO
BE
THAT
THE

OF

DWELL
IN
YOU
NOW
IF
ANY
MAN
HAVE
NOT
THE

OF

HE
IS
NONE
OF
HIS
AND
IF
CHRIST
BE
IN
YOU
THE
BODY
IS
DEAD
BECAUSE
OF
SIN
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
IS
LIFE
BECAUSE
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BUT
IF
THE

OF
HIM
THAT
RAISED
UP
JESUS
FROM
THE

DWELL
IN
YOU
HE
THAT
RAISED
UP
CHRIST
FROM
THE

SHALL
ALSO
QUICKEN
YOUR
MORTAL
BODIES
BY
HIS

THAT
DWELLETH
IN
YOU
THEREFORE
BRETHREN
WE
ARE
DEBTORS
NOT
TO
THE
FLESH
TO
LIVE
AFTER
THE
FLESH
FOR
IF
YE
LIVE
AFTER
THE

YE
SHALL
DIE
BUT
IF
YE
THROUGH
THE

DO
MORTIFY
THE
DEEDS
OF
THE
BODY
YE
SHALL
LIVE
FOR
AS
MANY
AS
ARE
LED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
THEY
ARE
THE
SONS
OF
GOD
FOR
YE
HAVE
NOT
RECEIVED
THE
SPIRIT
OF
BONDAGE
AGAIN
TO
FEAR
BUT
YE
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
SPIRIT
OF
ADOPTION
WHEREBY
WE
CRY
ABBA
FATHER
THE
SPIRIT
ITSELF
BEARETH
WITNESS
WITH
OUR

THAT
WE
ARE
THE

AND
IF
CHILDREN
THEN
HEIRS
HEIRS
OF

AND
JOINT-HEIRS
WITH

IF
SO
BE
THAT
WE
SUFFER
WITH
HIM
THAT
WE
MAY
BE
ALSO
GLORIFIED
TOGETHER
FOR
I
RECKON
THAT
THE
SUFFERINGS
OF
THIS
PRESENT
TIME
ARE
NOT
WORTHY
TO
BE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
GLORY
WHICH
SHALL
BE
REVEALED
IN
US
FOR
THE
EARNEST
EXPECTATION
OF
THE
CREATURE
WAITETH
FOR
THE
MANIFESTATION
OF
THE
SONS
OF
GOD
FOR
THE
CREATURE
WAS
MADE
SUBJECT
TO
VANITY
NOT
WILLINGLY
BUT
BY
REASON
OF
HIM
WHO
HATH
SUBJECTED
THE
SAME
IN
HOPE
BECAUSE
THE
CREATURE
ITSELF
ALSO
SHALL
BE
DELIVERED
FROM
THE
BONDAGE
OF
CORRUPTION
INTO
THE
GLORIOUS
LIBERTY
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
FOR
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
WHOLE
CREATION
GROANETH
AND
TRAVAILETH
IN
PAIN
TOGETHER
UNTIL
NOW
AND
NOT
ONLY
THEY
BUT
OURSELVES
ALSO
WHICH
HAVE
THE
FIRSTFRUITS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
EVEN
WE
OURSELVES
GROAN
WITHIN
OURSELVES
WAITING
FOR
THE
ADOPTION
TO
WIT
THE
REDEMPTION
OF
OUR
BODY
FOR
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
HOPE
BUT
HOPE
THAT
IS
SEEN
IS
NOT
HOPE
FOR
WHAT
A
MAN
SEETH
WHY
DOTH
HE
YET
HOPE
FOR
BUT
IF
WE
HOPE
FOR
THAT
WE
SEE
NOT
THEN
DO
WE
WITH
PATIENCE
WAIT
FOR
IT
LIKEWISE
THE
SPIRIT
ALSO
HELPETH
OUR
INFIRMITIES
FOR
WE
KNOW
NOT
WHAT
WE
SHOULD
PRAY
FOR
AS
WE
OUGHT
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
ITSELF
MAKETH
INTERCESSION
FOR
US
WITH
GROANINGS
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
UTTERED
AND
HE
THAT
SEARCHETH
THE
HEARTS
KNOWETH
WHAT
IS
THE
MIND
OF
THE
SPIRIT
BECAUSE
HE
MAKETH
INTERCESSION
FOR
THE
SAINTS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
AND
WE
KNOW
THAT
ALL
THINGS
WORK
TOGETHER
FOR
GOOD
TO
THEM
THAT
LOVE
GOD
TO
THEM
WHO
ARE
THE
CALLED
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
PURPOSE
FOR
WHOM
HE
DID
FOREKNOW
HE
ALSO
DID
PREDESTINATE
TO
BE
CONFORMED
TO
THE
IMAGE
OF
HIS

THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
THE
FIRSTBORN
AMONG
MANY
BRETHREN
MOREOVER
WHOM
HE
DID
PREDESTINATE
THEM
HE
ALSO
CALLED
AND
WHOM
HE
CALLED
THEM
HE
ALSO
JUSTIFIED
AND
WHOM
HE
JUSTIFIED
THEM
HE
ALSO
GLORIFIED
WHAT
SHALL
WE
THEN
SAY
TO
THESE
THINGS
IF
GOD
BE
FOR
US
WHO
CAN
BE
AGAINST
US
HE
THAT
SPARED
NOT
HIS
OWN
SON
BUT
DELIVERED
HIM
UP
FOR
US
ALL
HOW
SHALL
HE
NOT
WITH
HIM
ALSO
FREELY
GIVE
US
ALL
THINGS
WHO
SHALL
LAY
ANY
THING
TO
THE
CHARGE
OF
GOD'S
ELECT
IT
IS
GOD
THAT
JUSTIFIETH
WHO
IS
HE
THAT
CONDEMNETH
IT
IS

THAT
DIED
YEA
RATHER
THAT
IS
RISEN

WHO
IS
EVEN
AT
THE

WHO
ALSO

FOR
THE

NAY
IN
ALL
THESE

WE
ARE

THAT
IS
THEY
WHICH
ARE
THE

THESE
ARE
NOT
THE

BUT
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE

ARE
COUNTED
FOR
THE

FOR
THIS
IS
THE
WORD
OF
PROMISE
AT

WILL
I
COME
AND
SARAH
SHALL
HAVE
A

AND
NOT

THIS
BUT
WHEN
REBECCA
ALSO
HAD
CONCEIVED
BY

EVEN
BY
OUR
FATHER
ISAAC
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
BEING
NOT

BORN
NEITHER
HAVING
DONE
ANY
GOOD
OR
EVIL
THAT
THE
PURPOSE
OF

ACCORDING

MIGHT
STAND
NOT

OF
HIM
THAT
CALLETH
IT
WAS
SAID
UNTO

THE
ELDER
SHALL
SERVE
THE
YOUNGER
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
JACOB
HAVE
I
LOVED
BUT
ESAU
HAVE
I
HATED
WHAT
SHALL
WE
SAY
THEN
IS
THERE
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
WITH
GOD
GOD
FORBID
FOR
HE
SAITH
TO
MOSES
I
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
ON
WHOM
I
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
AND
I
WILL
HAVE
COMPASSION
ON
WHOM
I
WILL
HAVE
COMPASSION
SO
THEN
IT
IS
NOT
OF
HIM
THAT
WILLETH
NOR
OF
HIM
THAT
RUNNETH
BUT
OF
GOD
THAT
SHEWETH
MERCY
FOR
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAITH
UNTO
PHARAOH
EVEN
FOR
THIS

PURPOSE
HAVE
I
RAISED
THEE

THAT
I

THEREFORE
HATH

MERCY
ON
WHOM
HE
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
AND
WHOM

HE
HARDENETH
THOU
WILT
SAY
THEN
UNTO

WHY
DOTH
HE
YET
FIND
FAULT
FOR
WHO
HATH
RESISTED
HIS

NAY
BUT
O
MAN
WHO
ART
THOU
THAT
REPLIEST
AGAINST
GOD
SHALL
THE
THING
FORMED
SAY
TO
HIM
THAT
FORMED
IT
WHY
HAST
THOU
MADE
ME
THUS
HATH
NOT
THE
POTTER
POWER
OVER
THE
CLAY
OF
THE

TO
MAKE
ONE
VESSEL
UNTO
HONOUR
AND
ANOTHER
UNTO
DISHONOUR
WHAT
IF
GOD
WILLING
TO
SHEW
HIS
WRATH
AND
TO
MAKE
HIS
POWER
KNOWN
ENDURED
WITH
MUCH
LONGSUFFERING
THE
VESSELS
OF
WRATH
FITTED
TO
DESTRUCTION
AND
THAT
HE
MIGHT
MAKE
KNOWN
THE
RICHES
OF
HIS

ON
THE

OF

WHICH
HE
HAD
AFORE
PREPARED
UNTO

EVEN
US
WHOM
HE
HATH

NOT

BUT
ALSO
OF
THE

AS
HE
SAITH
ALSO
IN

I
WILL
CALL
THEM
MY

WHICH
WERE
NOT
MY

BELOVED
WHICH
WAS

AND
IT
SHALL
COME
TO
PASS
THAT
IN
THE

WHERE
IT
WAS

YE
ARE
NOT

THE

ESAIAS
ALSO

CONCERNING
ISRAEL
THOUGH
THE

A

SHALL
BE
SAVED
FOR
HE
WILL
FINISH
THE

CUT
IT
SHORT
IN
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BECAUSE
A
SHORT
WORK
WILL
THE

MAKE
UPON
THE

AND
AS
ESAIAS
SAID
BEFORE
EXCEPT
THE
LORD
OF
SABAOTH
HAD
LEFT
US
A
SEED
WE
HAD
BEEN
AS
SODOMA
AND
BEEN
MADE
LIKE
UNTO
GOMORRHA
WHAT
SHALL
WE
SAY
THEN
THAT
THE
GENTILES
WHICH
FOLLOWED
NOT
AFTER
RIGHTEOUSNESS
HAVE
ATTAINED
TO
RIGHTEOUSNESS
EVEN
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHICH
IS
OF

BUT
ISRAEL
WHICH
FOLLOWED
AFTER
THE
LAW
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
HATH
NOT
ATTAINED
TO
THE
LAW
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHEREFORE
BECAUSE
THEY
SOUGHT
IT
NOT
BY
FAITH
BUT
AS
IT
WERE
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE

FOR
THEY
STUMBLED
AT
THAT
STUMBLINGSTONE
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
BEHOLD
I
LAY
IN
SION
A
STUMBLINGSTONE
AND
ROCK
OF
OFFENCE
AND
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
ON
HIM
SHALL
NOT
BE
ASHAMED
BRETHREN
MY
HEART'S
DESIRE
AND
PRAYER
TO
GOD
FOR
ISRAEL
IS
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
BE
SAVED
FOR
I
BEAR
THEM
RECORD
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
ZEAL
OF
GOD
BUT
NOT
ACCORDING
TO
KNOWLEDGE
FOR
THEY
BEING
IGNORANT
OF
GOD'S
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
GOING
ABOUT
TO
ESTABLISH
THEIR
OWN
RIGHTEOUSNESS
HAVE
NOT
SUBMITTED
THEMSELVES
UNTO
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
FOR
CHRIST
IS
THE
END
OF
THE
LAW
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
TO
EVERY
ONE
THAT
BELIEVETH
FOR
MOSES
DESCRIBETH
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHICH
IS
OF
THE
LAW
THAT
THE
MAN
WHICH
DOETH
THOSE
THINGS
SHALL
LIVE
BY
THEM
BUT
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHICH
IS
OF
FAITH
SPEAKETH
ON
THIS
WISE
SAY
NOT
IN
THINE
HEART
WHO
SHALL
ASCEND
INTO
HEAVEN
THAT
IS
TO
BRING
CHRIST
DOWN
FROM
ABOVE
OR
WHO
SHALL
DESCEND
INTO
THE

THAT
IS
TO
BRING
UP
CHRIST
AGAIN
FROM
THE

BUT
WHAT
SAITH
IT
THE
WORD
IS
NIGH
THEE
EVEN
IN
THY
MOUTH
AND
IN
THY

THAT
IS
THE
WORD
OF

WHICH
WE
PREACH
THAT
IF
THOU
SHALT
CONFESS
WITH

THE

JESUS
AND
SHALT
BELIEVE
IN
THINE

THAT
GOD
HATH

THOU
SHALT

CONFESSION
IS

UNTO
SALVATION
FOR
THE

SAITH
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
ON

SHALL
NOT

FOR
THERE
IS
NO

BETWEEN
THE

FOR
THE

OVER

UNTO
ALL
THAT
CALL

FOR
WHOSOEVER

THE

HOW

IN
WHOM
THEY

AND
HOW

IN

OF
WHOM
THEY
HAVE
NOT

AND
HOW

THEY
HEAR
WITHOUT
A

AND
HOW

THEY
PREACH
EXCEPT
THEY
BE
SENT
AS
IT
IS

HOW
BEAUTIFUL
ARE
THE
FEET
OF
THEM
THAT
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
OF
PEACE
AND
BRING
GLAD
TIDINGS
OF
GOOD

BUT
THEY
HAVE
NOT

OBEYED
THE
GOSPEL
FOR
ESAIAS
SAITH
LORD
WHO
HATH
BELIEVED
OUR
REPORT
SO
THEN
FAITH
COMETH
BY

AND
HEARING
BY
THE

BUT
I
SAY
HAVE
THEY
NOT
HEARD
YES
VERILY
THEIR
SOUND
WENT
INTO
ALL
THE

AND
THEIR

UNTO
THE

OF
THE

BUT
I

DID
NOT
ISRAEL
KNOW
FIRST
MOSES
SAITH
I
WILL
PROVOKE
YOU
TO
JEALOUSY
BY
THEM
THAT
ARE
NO

AND
BY
A
FOOLISH
NATION
I
WILL
ANGER
YOU
BUT
ESAIAS
IS
VERY
BOLD
AND
SAITH
I
WAS
FOUND
OF
THEM
THAT
SOUGHT
ME
NOT
I
WAS
MADE
MANIFEST
UNTO
THEM
THAT
ASKED
NOT
AFTER
ME
BUT
TO
ISRAEL
HE
SAITH
ALL
DAY
LONG
I
HAVE
STRETCHED
FORTH
MY
HANDS
UNTO
A
DISOBEDIENT
AND
GAINSAYING
PEOPLE
I
SAY
THEN
HATH
GOD
CAST
AWAY
HIS
PEOPLE
GOD
FORBID
FOR
I
ALSO
AM
AN
ISRAELITE
OF
THE

OF
ABRAHAM
OF
THE

OF
BENJAMIN
GOD
HATH
NOT
CAST
AWAY
HIS
PEOPLE
WHICH
HE
FOREKNEW
WOT
YE
NOT
WHAT
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAITH
OF
ELIAS
HOW
HE
MAKETH
INTERCESSION
TO
GOD
AGAINST
ISRAEL
SAYING
LORD
THEY
HAVE
KILLED
THY
PROPHETS
AND
DIGGED
DOWN
THINE
ALTARS
AND
I
AM
LEFT
ALONE
AND
THEY
SEEK
MY

BUT
WHAT
SAITH
THE
ANSWER
OF
GOD
UNTO
HIM
I
HAVE
RESERVED
TO
MYSELF
SEVEN
THOUSAND
MEN
WHO
HAVE
NOT
BOWED
THE
KNEE
TO
THE
IMAGE
OF
BAAL
EVEN
SO
THEN
AT
THIS
PRESENT
TIME
ALSO
THERE
IS
A
REMNANT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ELECTION
OF

AND
IF
BY

THEN
IS
IT
NO
MORE
OF
WORKS
OTHERWISE
GRACE
IS
NO

GRACE
BUT
IF
IT
BE
OF

THEN
IT
IS
NO

GRACE
OTHERWISE
WORK
IS
NO
MORE
WORK
WHAT
THEN
ISRAEL
HATH
NOT
OBTAINED
THAT
WHICH
HE
SEEKETH
FOR
BUT
THE
ELECTION
HATH
OBTAINED
IT
AND
THE
REST
WERE
BLINDED
ACCORDING
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
GOD
HATH
GIVEN
THEM
THE
SPIRIT
OF
SLUMBER
EYES
THAT
THEY

LET

UNTO

LET

THAT
THEY

ALWAY
I

GOD

BUT
RATHER
THROUGH

SALVATION
IS
COME
UNTO

THE

HOW

FOR
IF
THE

OF

BE
THE
RECONCILING
OF
THE

WHAT

THE
RECEIVING
OF

BE
BUT
LIFE
FROM
THE

FOR
IF
THE
FIRSTFRUIT
BE
HOLY
THE

IS
ALSO
HOLY
AND
IF
THE

BE
HOLY
SO
ARE
THE

AND
IF
SOME
OF
THE

BE
BROKEN
OFF
AND
THOU
BEING
A

OLIVE
TREE
WERT
GRAFFED
IN
AMONG

AND
WITH

PARTAKEST
OF
THE

OF

BUT
IF
THOU
BOAST
THOU
BEAREST
NOT
THE

BUT
THE

THEE
THOU
WILT
SAY
THEN
THE
BRANCHES
WERE
BROKEN
OFF
THAT
I
MIGHT
BE
GRAFFED
IN
WELL
BECAUSE
OF
UNBELIEF
THEY
WERE
BROKEN
OFF
AND
THOU
STANDEST
BY

BE
NOT
HIGHMINDED
BUT
FEAR
FOR
IF
GOD
SPARED
NOT
THE
NATURAL
BRANCHES
TAKE
HEED
LEST
HE
ALSO
SPARE
NOT
THEE
BEHOLD
THEREFORE
THE

AND
SEVERITY
OF

WHICH
FELL
SEVERITY
BUT
TOWARD

IF

OTHERWISE
THOU
ALSO
SHALT

AND
THEY
ALSO
IF
THEY

NOT
STILL
IN

WHICH
IS

HOW
MUCH
MORE
SHALL
THESE
WHICH
BE
THE

FOR
I
WOULD
NOT
BRETHREN
THAT
YE
SHOULD
BE
IGNORANT
OF
THIS
MYSTERY
LEST
YE
SHOULD
BE
WISE
IN
YOUR

CONCEITS
THAT
BLINDNESS
IN
PART
IS
HAPPENED
TO
ISRAEL
UNTIL
THE

OF
THE

SO
ALL
ISRAEL

AS
IT
IS

THERE
SHALL
COME
OUT
OF

THE

UNGODLINESS
FROM

FOR
THIS
IS
MY

UNTO
THEM
WHEN
I
SHALL
TAKE
AWAY
THEIR

AS
CONCERNING
THE

THEY
ARE
ENEMIES
FOR
YOUR

BUT
AS
TOUCHING
THE

THEY
ARE
BELOVED
FOR
THE

FOR
THE

HAVE
NOT

THROUGH

HATH
CONCLUDED

BOTH
OF
THE

THE

THE
WEAK
THINGS
OF

BASE
THINGS
OF
THE

HATH
GOD
CHOSEN

AND
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
NOT

THINGS
THAT

JESUS
WHO
OF

IS
MADE
UNTO

WISDOM
AND
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
SANCTIFICATION
AND
REDEMPTION
THAT
ACCORDING
AS

HE
THAT

LET

AND
I
BRETHREN
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
YOU
CAME
NOT
WITH
EXCELLENCY
OF

OR
OF
WISDOM
DECLARING
UNTO
YOU
THE
TESTIMONY
OF

FOR
I
DETERMINED
NOT

CRUCIFIED
AND
I
WAS
WITH
YOU
IN
WEAKNESS
AND
IN
FEAR
AND
IN
MUCH
TREMBLING
AND
MY
SPEECH
AND
MY
PREACHING
WAS
NOT
WITH
ENTICING
WORDS
OF
MAN'S
WISDOM
BUT
IN
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THE
SPIRIT
AND
OF
POWER
THAT
YOUR
FAITH
SHOULD
NOT
STAND
IN
THE
WISDOM
OF
MEN
BUT
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
HOWBEIT
WE
SPEAK
WISDOM
AMONG
THEM
THAT
ARE
PERFECT
YET
NOT
THE
WISDOM
OF
THIS
WORLD
NOR
OF
THE
PRINCES
OF
THIS
WORLD
THAT
COME
TO
NOUGHT
BUT
WE
SPEAK
THE
WISDOM
OF
GOD
IN
A
MYSTERY
EVEN
THE
HIDDEN
WISDOM
WHICH
GOD
ORDAINED
BEFORE
THE
WORLD
UNTO
OUR
GLORY
WHICH
NONE
OF
THE
PRINCES
OF
THIS
WORLD
KNEW
FOR
HAD
THEY
KNOWN
IT
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
CRUCIFIED
THE
LORD
OF
GLORY
BUT
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
EYE
HATH
NOT
SEEN
NOR
EAR
HEARD
NEITHER
HAVE
ENTERED
INTO
THE
HEART
OF
MAN
THE
THINGS
WHICH
GOD
HATH
PREPARED
FOR
THEM
THAT
LOVE
HIM
BUT
GOD
HATH
REVEALED
THEM
UNTO
US
BY
HIS
SPIRIT
FOR
THE
SPIRIT
SEARCHETH
ALL
THINGS
YEA
THE
DEEP
THINGS
OF
GOD
FOR
WHAT
MAN
KNOWETH
THE
THINGS
OF
A
MAN
SAVE
THE
SPIRIT
OF
MAN
WHICH
IS
IN
HIM
EVEN
SO
THE
THINGS
OF
GOD
KNOWETH
NO
MAN
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
NOW
WE
HAVE
RECEIVED
NOT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
WORLD
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
WHICH
IS
OF
GOD
THAT
WE
MIGHT
KNOW
THE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
FREELY
GIVEN
TO
US
OF
GOD
WHICH
THINGS
ALSO
WE
SPEAK
NOT
IN
THE
WORDS
WHICH
MAN'S
WISDOM
TEACHETH
BUT
WHICH
THE
HOLY
GHOST
TEACHETH
COMPARING
SPIRITUAL
THINGS
WITH
SPIRITUAL
BUT
THE
NATURAL
MAN
RECEIVETH
NOT
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
FOR
THEY
ARE
FOOLISHNESS
UNTO
HIM
NEITHER
CAN
HE
KNOW
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SPIRITUALLY
DISCERNED
BUT
HE
THAT
IS
SPIRITUAL
JUDGETH
ALL
THINGS
YET
HE
HIMSELF
IS
JUDGED
OF
NO
MAN
FOR
WHO
HATH
KNOWN
THE
MIND
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
HE
MAY
INSTRUCT
HIM
BUT
WE
HAVE
THE
MIND
OF
CHRIST
AND
I
BRETHREN
COULD
NOT
SPEAK
UNTO
YOU
AS
UNTO
SPIRITUAL
BUT
AS
UNTO
CARNAL
EVEN
AS
UNTO
BABES
IN
CHRIST
I
HAVE
FED
YOU
WITH
MILK
AND
NOT
WITH
MEAT
FOR
HITHERTO
YE
WERE
NOT
ABLE
TO
BEAR
IT
NEITHER
YET
NOW
ARE
YE
ABLE
FOR
YE
ARE
YET
CARNAL
FOR
WHEREAS
THERE
IS
AMONG
YOU
ENVYING
AND
STRIFE
AND
DIVISIONS
ARE
YE
NOT
CARNAL
AND
WALK
AS
MEN
FOR
WHILE
ONE
SAITH
I
AM
OF
PAUL
AND
ANOTHER
I
AM
OF
APOLLOS
ARE
YE
NOT
CARNAL
WHO
THEN
IS
PAUL
AND
WHO
IS
APOLLOS
BUT
MINISTERS
BY
WHOM
YE
BELIEVED
EVEN
AS
THE
LORD
GAVE
TO
EVERY
MAN
I
HAVE
PLANTED
APOLLOS
WATERED
BUT
GOD
GAVE
THE
INCREASE
SO
THEN
NEITHER
IS
HE
THAT
PLANTETH
ANY
THING
NEITHER
HE
THAT
WATERETH
BUT
GOD
THAT
GIVETH
THE
INCREASE
NOW
HE
THAT
PLANTETH
AND
HE
THAT
WATERETH
ARE
ONE
AND
EVERY
MAN
SHALL
RECEIVE
HIS
OWN
REWARD
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
OWN
LABOUR
FOR
WE
ARE
LABOURERS
TOGETHER
WITH
GOD
YE
ARE
GOD'S
HUSBANDRY
YE
ARE
GOD'S
BUILDING
ACCORDING
TO
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
WHICH
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
ME
AS
A
WISE
MASTERBUILDER
I
HAVE
LAID
THE
FOUNDATION
AND
ANOTHER
BUILDETH
THEREON
BUT
LET
EVERY
MAN
TAKE
HEED
HOW
HE
BUILDETH
THEREUPON
FOR
OTHER
FOUNDATION
CAN
NO
MAN
LAY
THAN
THAT
IS
LAID
WHICH
IS
JESUS
CHRIST
NOW
IF
ANY
MAN
BUILD
UPON
THIS
FOUNDATION
GOLD
SILVER
PRECIOUS
STONES
WOOD
HAY
STUBBLE
EVERY
MAN'S
WORK
SHALL
BE
MADE
MANIFEST
FOR
THE
DAY
SHALL
DECLARE
IT
BECAUSE
IT
SHALL
BE
REVEALED
BY
FIRE
AND
THE
FIRE
SHALL
TRY
EVERY
MAN'S
WORK
OF
WHAT
SORT
IT
IS
IF
ANY
MAN'S
WORK
ABIDE
WHICH
HE
HATH
BUILT
THEREUPON
HE
SHALL
RECEIVE
A
REWARD
IF
ANY
MAN'S
WORK
SHALL
BE
BURNED
HE
SHALL
SUFFER
LOSS
BUT
HE
HIMSELF
SHALL
BE
SAVED
YET
SO
AS
BY
FIRE
KNOW
YE
NOT
THAT
YE
ARE
THE
TEMPLE
OF
GOD
AND
THAT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
DWELLETH
IN
YOU
IF
ANY
MAN
DEFILE
THE
TEMPLE
OF
GOD
HIM
SHALL
GOD
DESTROY
FOR
THE
TEMPLE
OF
GOD
IS
HOLY
WHICH
TEMPLE
YE
ARE
LET
NO
MAN
DECEIVE
HIMSELF
IF
ANY
MAN
AMONG
YOU
SEEMETH
TO
BE
WISE
IN
THIS
WORLD
LET
HIM
BECOME
A
FOOL
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
WISE
FOR
THE
WISDOM
OF
THIS
WORLD
IS
FOOLISHNESS
WITH
GOD
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
HE
TAKETH
THE
WISE
IN
THEIR
OWN
CRAFTINESS
AND
AGAIN
THE
LORD
KNOWETH
THE
THOUGHTS
OF
THE
WISE
THAT
THEY
ARE
VAIN
THEREFORE
LET
NO
MAN
GLORY
IN
MEN
FOR
ALL
THINGS
ARE
YOUR'S
WHETHER
PAUL
OR
APOLLOS
OR
CEPHAS
OR
THE
WORLD
OR
LIFE
OR
DEATH
OR
THINGS
PRESENT
OR
THINGS
TO
COME
ALL
ARE
YOUR'S
AND
YE
ARE
CHRIST'S
AND
CHRIST
IS
GOD'S
LET
A
MAN
SO
ACCOUNT
OF
US
AS
OF
THE
MINISTERS
OF
CHRIST
AND
STEWARDS
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
GOD
MOREOVER
IT
IS
REQUIRED
IN
STEWARDS
THAT
A
MAN
BE
FOUND
FAITHFUL
BUT
WITH
ME
IT
IS
A
VERY
SMALL
THING
THAT
I
SHOULD
BE
JUDGED
OF
YOU
OR
OF
MAN'S
JUDGMENT
YEA
I
JUDGE
NOT
MINE
OWN
SELF
FOR
I
KNOW
NOTHING
BY
MYSELF
YET
AM
I
NOT
HEREBY
JUSTIFIED
BUT
HE
THAT
JUDGETH
ME
IS
THE
LORD
THEREFORE
JUDGE
NOTHING
BEFORE
THE
TIME
UNTIL
THE
LORD
COME
WHO
BOTH
WILL
BRING
TO
LIGHT
THE
HIDDEN
THINGS
OF
DARKNESS
AND
WILL
MAKE
MANIFEST
THE
COUNSELS
OF
THE
HEARTS
AND
THEN
SHALL
EVERY
MAN
HAVE
PRAISE
OF
GOD
AND
THESE
THINGS
BRETHREN
I
HAVE
IN
A
FIGURE
TRANSFERRED
TO
MYSELF
AND
TO
APOLLOS
FOR
YOUR
SAKES
THAT
YE
MIGHT
LEARN
IN
US
NOT
TO
THINK
OF
MEN
ABOVE
THAT
WHICH
IS
WRITTEN
THAT
NO
ONE
OF
YOU
BE
PUFFED
UP
FOR
ONE
AGAINST
ANOTHER
FOR
WHO
MAKETH
THEE
TO
DIFFER
FROM

AND
WHAT
HAST
THOU
THAT
THOU
DIDST
NOT
RECEIVE
NOW
IF
THOU
DIDST
RECEIVE
IT
WHY
DOST
THOU
GLORY
AS
IF
THOU
HADST
NOT

IT
NOW
YE
ARE
FULL
NOW
YE
ARE
RICH
YE
HAVE
REIGNED
AS
KINGS
WITHOUT
US
AND
I
WOULD
TO
GOD
YE
DID
REIGN
THAT
WE
ALSO
MIGHT
REIGN
WITH
YOU
FOR
I
THINK
THAT
GOD
HATH
SET
FORTH
US
THE
APOSTLES
LAST
AS
IT
WERE
APPOINTED
TO
DEATH
FOR
WE
ARE
MADE
A
SPECTACLE
UNTO
THE
WORLD
AND
TO
ANGELS
AND
TO
MEN
WE
ARE
FOOLS
FOR
CHRIST'S
SAKE
BUT
YE
ARE
WISE
IN
CHRIST
WE
ARE
WEAK
BUT
YE
ARE
STRONG
YE
ARE
HONOURABLE
BUT
WE
ARE
DESPISED
EVEN
UNTO
THIS

AND
ARE
NAKED
AND
ARE
BUFFETED
AND
HAVE
NO
CERTAIN
DWELLINGPLACE
AND

WORKING
WITH
OUR

BEING
REVILED
WE
BLESS
BEING
PERSECUTED
WE
SUFFER
IT
BEING
DEFAMED
WE
INTREAT
WE
ARE

THE
OFFSCOURING
OF
ALL

UNTO
THIS

COME
TO
YOU
SHORTLY
IF
THE
LORD
WILL
AND
WILL
KNOW
NOT
THE
SPEECH
OF
THEM
WHICH

BUT
THE
POWER

IS
NOT
IN

BUT
IN
POWER
WHAT
WILL
YE
SHALL
I
COME
UNTO
YOU
WITH
A
ROD
OR
IN

AND
IN
THE
SPIRIT
OF

SUCH
FORNICATION
AS

NOT
SO

AS
NAMED
AMONG

HAVE
HIS
FATHER'S
WIFE
AND
YE
ARE
PUFFED
UP
AND
HAVE
NOT
RATHER
MOURNED
THAT
HE
THAT
HATH

THIS
DEED

NOT
WITH

AN
HUSBAND
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
AND
IF
HE
BE
PLEASED
TO
DWELL
WITH
HER
LET
HER
NOT
LEAVE
HIM
FOR
THE
UNBELIEVING
HUSBAND

AND
THE
UNBELIEVING
WIFE
IS
SANCTIFIED
BY
THE
HUSBAND
ELSE
WERE
YOUR

UNCLEAN
BUT
NOW
ARE
THEY
HOLY
BUT
IF
THE
UNBELIEVING
DEPART
LET
HIM
DEPART
A
BROTHER
OR
A
SISTER
IS
NOT
UNDER
BONDAGE
IN
SUCH
CASES
BUT
GOD
HATH
CALLED
US
TO
PEACE
FOR
WHAT
KNOWEST
THOU
O
WIFE
WHETHER
THOU
SHALT
SAVE
THY
HUSBAND
OR
HOW
KNOWEST
THOU
O
MAN
WHETHER
THOU
SHALT
SAVE
THY
WIFE
BUT
AS
GOD
HATH
DISTRIBUTED
TO
EVERY
MAN
AS
THE
LORD
HATH
CALLED
EVERY
ONE
SO
LET
HIM
WALK
AND
SO
ORDAIN
I
IN
ALL
CHURCHES
IS
ANY
MAN
CALLED
BEING
CIRCUMCISED
LET
HIM
NOT
BECOME
UNCIRCUMCISED
IS
ANY
CALLED
IN
UNCIRCUMCISION
LET
HIM
NOT
BE
CIRCUMCISED
CIRCUMCISION
IS
NOTHING
AND
UNCIRCUMCISION
IS
NOTHING
BUT
THE
KEEPING
OF
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
GOD
LET
EVERY
MAN
ABIDE
IN
THE
SAME
CALLING
WHEREIN
HE
WAS
CALLED
ART
THOU
CALLED
BEING
A
SERVANT
CARE
NOT
FOR
IT
BUT
IF
THOU
MAYEST
BE
MADE
FREE
USE
IT
RATHER
FOR
HE
THAT
IS
CALLED
IN
THE
LORD
BEING
A
SERVANT
IS
THE
LORD'S
FREEMAN
LIKEWISE
ALSO
HE
THAT
IS
CALLED
BEING
FREE
IS
CHRIST'S
SERVANT
YE
ARE
BOUGHT
WITH
A
PRICE
BE
NOT
YE
THE
SERVANTS
OF
MEN
BRETHREN
LET
EVERY
MAN
WHEREIN
HE
IS
CALLED
THEREIN
ABIDE
WITH
GOD
NOW
CONCERNING
VIRGINS
I
HAVE
NO
COMMANDMENT
OF
THE
LORD
YET
I
GIVE
MY
JUDGMENT
AS
ONE
THAT
HATH
OBTAINED
MERCY
OF
THE
LORD
TO
BE
FAITHFUL
I
SUPPOSE
THEREFORE
THAT
THIS
IS
GOOD
FOR
THE
PRESENT
DISTRESS
I
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
GOOD
FOR
A
MAN
SO
TO
BE
ART
THOU
BOUND
UNTO
A
WIFE
SEEK
NOT
TO
BE
LOOSED
ART
THOU
LOOSED
FROM
A
WIFE
SEEK
NOT
A
WIFE
BUT
AND
IF
THOU
MARRY
THOU
HAST
NOT
SINNED
AND
IF
A
VIRGIN
MARRY
SHE
HATH
NOT
SINNED
NEVERTHELESS
SUCH
SHALL
HAVE
TROUBLE
IN
THE
FLESH
BUT
I
SPARE
YOU
BUT
THIS
I
SAY
BRETHREN
THE
TIME
IS
SHORT
IT
REMAINETH
THAT
BOTH
THEY
THAT
HAVE
WIVES
BE
AS
THOUGH
THEY
HAD
NONE
AND
THEY
THAT
WEEP
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WEPT
NOT
AND
THEY
THAT
REJOICE
AS
THOUGH
THEY
REJOICED
NOT
AND
THEY
THAT
BUY
AS
THOUGH
THEY
POSSESSED
NOT
AND
THEY
THAT
USE
THIS
WORLD
AS
NOT
ABUSING
IT
FOR
THE
FASHION
OF
THIS
WORLD
PASSETH
AWAY
BUT
I
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
WITHOUT
CAREFULNESS
HE
THAT
IS
UNMARRIED
CARETH
FOR
THE
THINGS
THAT
BELONG
TO
THE
LORD
HOW
HE
MAY
PLEASE
THE
LORD
BUT
HE
THAT
IS
MARRIED
CARETH
FOR
THE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
OF
THE
WORLD
HOW
HE
MAY
PLEASE
HIS
WIFE
THERE
IS
DIFFERENCE
ALSO
BETWEEN
A
WIFE
AND
A
VIRGIN
THE
UNMARRIED
WOMAN
CARETH
FOR
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
SHE
MAY
BE
HOLY
BOTH
IN
BODY
AND
IN
SPIRIT
BUT
SHE
THAT
IS
MARRIED
CARETH
FOR
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
WORLD
HOW
SHE
MAY
PLEASE
HER
HUSBAND
AND
THIS
I
SPEAK
FOR
YOUR
OWN
PROFIT
NOT
THAT
I
MAY
CAST
A
SNARE
UPON
YOU
BUT
FOR
THAT
WHICH
IS
COMELY
AND
THAT
YE
MAY
ATTEND
UPON
THE
LORD
WITHOUT
DISTRACTION
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
THINK
THAT
HE
BEHAVETH
HIMSELF
UNCOMELY
TOWARD
HIS
VIRGIN
IF
SHE
PASS
THE
FLOWER
OF
HER
AGE
AND
NEED
SO
REQUIRE
LET
HIM
DO
WHAT
HE
WILL
HE
SINNETH
NOT
LET
THEM
MARRY
NEVERTHELESS
HE
THAT
STANDETH
STEDFAST
IN
HIS
HEART
HAVING
NO
NECESSITY
BUT
HATH
POWER
OVER
HIS
OWN
WILL
AND
HATH
SO
DECREED
IN
HIS
HEART
THAT
HE
WILL
KEEP
HIS
VIRGIN
DOETH
WELL
SO
THEN
HE
THAT
GIVETH
HER
IN
MARRIAGE
DOETH
WELL
BUT
HE
THAT
GIVETH
HER
NOT
IN
MARRIAGE
DOETH
BETTER
THE
WIFE
IS
BOUND
BY
THE
LAW
AS
LONG
AS
HER
HUSBAND
LIVETH
BUT
IF
HER
HUSBAND
BE
DEAD
SHE
IS
AT
LIBERTY
TO
BE
MARRIED
TO
WHOM
SHE
WILL
ONLY
IN
THE
LORD
BUT
SHE
IS
HAPPIER
IF
SHE
SO
ABIDE
AFTER
MY
JUDGMENT
AND
I
THINK
ALSO
THAT
I
HAVE
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
NOW
AS
TOUCHING
THINGS
OFFERED
UNTO
IDOLS
WE
KNOW
THAT
WE
ALL
HAVE
KNOWLEDGE
KNOWLEDGE
PUFFETH
UP
BUT
CHARITY
EDIFIETH
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
THINK
THAT
HE
KNOWETH
ANY
THING
HE
KNOWETH
NOTHING
YET
AS
HE
OUGHT
TO
KNOW
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
LOVE
GOD
THE
SAME
IS
KNOWN
OF
HIM
AS
CONCERNING
THEREFORE
THE
EATING
OF
THOSE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
OFFERED
IN
SACRIFICE
UNTO
IDOLS
WE
KNOW
THAT
AN
IDOL
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
NONE
OTHER
GOD
BUT
ONE
FOR
THOUGH
THERE
BE
THAT
ARE
CALLED
GODS
WHETHER
IN
HEAVEN
OR
IN
EARTH
AS
THERE
BE
GODS
MANY
AND
LORDS
MANY
BUT
TO
US
THERE
IS
BUT
ONE
GOD
THE
FATHER
OF
WHOM
ARE
ALL
THINGS
AND
WE
IN
HIM
AND
ONE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
BY
WHOM
ARE
ALL

AND
WE
BY
HIM
HOWBEIT
THERE
IS
NOT

UNTO
THIS

EAT
IT
AS
A

THESE

MAN
CREATED
FOR
THE

BUT
THE
WOMAN
FOR
THE
MAN
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
OUGHT
THE
WOMAN
TO
HAVE
POWER
ON
HER
HEAD
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ANGELS
NEVERTHELESS
NEITHER
IS
THE
MAN
WITHOUT
THE
WOMAN
NEITHER
THE
WOMAN
WITHOUT
THE
MAN
IN
THE
LORD
FOR
AS
THE
WOMAN
IS
OF
THE
MAN
EVEN
SO
IS
THE
MAN
ALSO
BY
THE
WOMAN
BUT
ALL
THINGS
OF
GOD
JUDGE
IN
YOURSELVES
IS
IT
COMELY
THAT
A
WOMAN
PRAY
UNTO
GOD
UNCOVERED
DOTH
NOT
EVEN
NATURE
ITSELF
TEACH
YOU
THAT
IF
A
MAN
HAVE
LONG
HAIR
IT
IS
A
SHAME
UNTO
HIM
BUT
IF
A
WOMAN
HAVE
LONG
HAIR
IT
IS
A
GLORY
TO
HER
FOR
HER
HAIR
IS
GIVEN
HER
FOR
A
COVERING
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
SEEM
TO
BE
CONTENTIOUS
WE
HAVE
NO
SUCH
CUSTOM
NEITHER
THE
CHURCHES
OF
GOD
NOW
IN
THIS
THAT
I
DECLARE
UNTO
YOU
I
PRAISE
YOU
NOT
THAT
YE
COME
TOGETHER
NOT
FOR
THE
BETTER
BUT
FOR
THE
WORSE
FOR
FIRST
OF
ALL
WHEN
YE
COME
TOGETHER
IN
THE
CHURCH
I
HEAR
THAT
THERE
BE
DIVISIONS
AMONG
YOU
AND
I
PARTLY
BELIEVE
IT
FOR
THERE
MUST
BE
ALSO
HERESIES
AMONG
YOU
THAT
THEY
WHICH
ARE
APPROVED
MAY
BE
MADE
MANIFEST
AMONG
YOU
WHEN
YE
COME
TOGETHER
THEREFORE
INTO
ONE
PLACE
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
EAT
THE
LORD'S
SUPPER
FOR
IN
EATING
EVERY
ONE
TAKETH
BEFORE
OTHER
HIS
OWN
SUPPER
AND
ONE
IS
HUNGRY
AND
ANOTHER
IS
DRUNKEN
WHAT
HAVE
YE
NOT
HOUSES
TO
EAT
AND
TO
DRINK
IN
OR
DESPISE
YE
THE
CHURCH
OF
GOD
AND
SHAME
THEM
THAT
HAVE
NOT
WHAT
SHALL
I
SAY
TO
YOU
SHALL
I
PRAISE
YOU
IN
THIS
I
PRAISE
YOU
NOT
FOR
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
WHICH
ALSO
I
DELIVERED
UNTO
YOU
THAT
THE
LORD
JESUS
THE
SAME
NIGHT
IN
WHICH
HE
WAS
BETRAYED
TOOK
BREAD
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
GIVEN
THANKS
HE
BRAKE
IT
AND
SAID
TAKE
EAT
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
WHICH
IS
BROKEN
FOR
YOU
THIS
DO
IN
REMEMBRANCE
OF
ME
AFTER
THE
SAME
MANNER
ALSO
HE
TOOK
THE
CUP
WHEN
HE
HAD
SUPPED
SAYING
THIS
CUP
IS
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
IN
MY
BLOOD
THIS
DO
YE
AS
OFT
AS
YE
DRINK
IT
IN
REMEMBRANCE
OF
ME
FOR
AS
OFTEN
AS
YE
EAT
THIS
BREAD
AND
DRINK
THIS
CUP
YE
DO
SHEW
THE
LORD'S
DEATH
TILL
HE
COME
WHEREFORE
WHOSOEVER
SHALL
EAT
THIS
BREAD
AND
DRINK
THIS
CUP
OF
THE
LORD
UNWORTHILY
SHALL
BE
GUILTY
OF
THE
BODY
AND
BLOOD
OF
THE
LORD
BUT
LET
A
MAN
EXAMINE
HIMSELF
AND
SO
LET
HIM
EAT
OF
THAT
BREAD
AND
DRINK
OF
THAT
CUP
FOR
HE
THAT
EATETH
AND
DRINKETH
UNWORTHILY
EATETH
AND
DRINKETH
DAMNATION
TO
HIMSELF
NOT
DISCERNING
THE
LORD'S
BODY
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
MANY
ARE
WEAK
AND
SICKLY
AMONG
YOU
AND
MANY
SLEEP
FOR
IF
WE
WOULD
JUDGE
OURSELVES
WE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
JUDGED
BUT
WHEN
WE
ARE
JUDGED
WE
ARE
CHASTENED
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CONDEMNED
WITH
THE
WORLD
WHEREFORE
MY
BRETHREN
WHEN
YE
COME
TOGETHER
TO
EAT
TARRY
ONE
FOR
ANOTHER
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
HUNGER
LET
HIM
EAT
AT
HOME
THAT
YE
COME
NOT
TOGETHER
UNTO
CONDEMNATION
AND
THE
REST
WILL
I
SET
IN
ORDER
WHEN
I
COME
NOW
CONCERNING
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
BRETHREN
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
YOU
IGNORANT
YE
KNOW
THAT
YE
WERE
GENTILES
CARRIED
AWAY
UNTO
THESE
DUMB
IDOLS
EVEN
AS
YE
WERE
LED
WHEREFORE
I
GIVE
YOU
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
NO
MAN
SPEAKING
BY
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
CALLETH
JESUS
ACCURSED
AND
THAT
NO
MAN
CAN
SAY
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
LORD
BUT
BY
THE
HOLY
GHOST
NOW
THERE
ARE
DIVERSITIES
OF
GIFTS
BUT
THE
SAME
SPIRIT
AND
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENCES
OF
ADMINISTRATIONS
BUT
THE
SAME
LORD
AND
THERE
ARE
DIVERSITIES
OF
OPERATIONS
BUT
IT
IS
THE

GOD
WHICH
WORKETH
ALL
IN
ALL
BUT
THE
MANIFESTATION
OF
THE

IS
GIVEN
TO
EVERY

I

UPON

WE

ABUNDANT
HONOUR
AND
OUR
UNCOMELY

HAVE

ABUNDANT
COMELINESS
FOR

GOD
HATH
TEMPERED
THE

TOGETHER
HAVING
GIVEN
MORE
ABUNDANT
HONOUR
TO
THAT

WHICH
LACKED
THAT
THERE
SHOULD

IS

EXCEPT

BRETHREN
IF
I
COME
UNTO

EITHER
BY

OR
BY

AND
EVEN

WITHOUT

IN

HOW
SHALL
IT
BE

WHAT

OR

FOR
IF
THE
TRUMPET
GIVE
AN
UNCERTAIN
SOUND
WHO
SHALL
PREPARE
HIMSELF
TO
THE

SO
LIKEWISE
YE
EXCEPT
YE
UTTER
BY
THE
TONGUE
WORDS
EASY
TO

UNDERSTOOD
HOW
SHALL
IT
BE

WHAT

SPOKEN
FOR
YE
SHALL
SPEAK
INTO

THERE
ARE
IT
MAY
BE
SO
MANY
KINDS
OF
VOICES
IN
THE

AND
NONE
OF

IS
WITHOUT

THEREFORE
IF
I

NOT
THE

I
SHALL
BE
UNTO

THAT
SPEAKETH
A
BARBARIAN
AND

FORASMUCH
AS
YE
ARE
ZEALOUS
OF

SEEK
THAT

TO
THE

OF
THE

WHEREFORE
LET
HIM
THAT
SPEAKETH
IN
AN

TONGUE
PRAY
THAT
HE
MAY
INTERPRET
FOR
IF
I
PRAY
IN
AN
UNKNOWN
TONGUE
MY
SPIRIT
PRAYETH
BUT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
UNFRUITFUL
WHAT
IS
IT
THEN
I
WILL
PRAY
WITH
THE

AND
I
WILL
PRAY
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
ALSO
I
WILL
SING
WITH
THE

AND
I
WILL
SING
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
ALSO
ELSE
WHEN
THOU
SHALT
BLESS
WITH
THE

HOW
SHALL
HE
THAT
OCCUPIETH
THE

OF
THE
UNLEARNED
SAY
AMEN
AT
THY
GIVING
OF
THANKS
SEEING
HE
UNDERSTANDETH
NOT
WHAT
THOU
SAYEST
FOR
THOU
VERILY
GIVEST
THANKS
WELL
BUT
THE
OTHER
IS
NOT
EDIFIED
I
THANK
MY
GOD
I
SPEAK
WITH
TONGUES
MORE
THAN
YE
ALL
YET
IN
THE
CHURCH
I
HAD
RATHER
SPEAK
FIVE
WORDS
WITH
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
BY
MY
VOICE
I
MIGHT
TEACH
OTHERS
ALSO
THAN
TEN
THOUSAND
WORDS
IN
AN
UNKNOWN
TONGUE
BRETHREN
BE
NOT
CHILDREN
IN

HOWBEIT
IN
MALICE
BE
YE
CHILDREN
BUT
IN
UNDERSTANDING
BE
MEN
IN
THE
LAW
IT
IS
WRITTEN
WITH
MEN
OF
OTHER
TONGUES
AND
OTHER
LIPS
WILL
I
SPEAK
UNTO
THIS
PEOPLE
AND
YET
FOR
ALL
THAT
WILL
THEY
NOT
HEAR
ME
SAITH
THE
LORD
WHEREFORE
TONGUES
ARE
FOR
A
SIGN
NOT
TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
BUT
TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
NOT
BUT
PROPHESYING
SERVETH
NOT
FOR
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
NOT
BUT
FOR
THEM
WHICH
BELIEVE
IF
THEREFORE
THE
WHOLE
CHURCH
BE
COME
TOGETHER
INTO
ONE
PLACE
AND
ALL
SPEAK
WITH
TONGUES
AND
THERE
COME
IN
THOSE
THAT
ARE
UNLEARNED
OR
UNBELIEVERS
WILL
THEY
NOT
SAY
THAT
YE
ARE
MAD
BUT
IF
ALL
PROPHESY
AND
THERE
COME
IN
ONE
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
OR
ONE
UNLEARNED
HE
IS
CONVINCED
OF
ALL
HE
IS
JUDGED
OF
ALL
AND
THUS
ARE
THE
SECRETS
OF
HIS
HEART
MADE
MANIFEST
AND
SO
FALLING
DOWN
ON
HIS
FACE
HE
WILL
WORSHIP
GOD
AND
REPORT
THAT
GOD
IS
IN
YOU
OF
A
TRUTH
HOW
IS
IT
THEN
BRETHREN
WHEN
YE
COME
TOGETHER
EVERY
ONE
OF
YOU
HATH
A
PSALM
HATH
A
DOCTRINE
HATH
A
TONGUE
HATH
A
REVELATION
HATH
AN
INTERPRETATION
LET
ALL
THINGS
BE

UNTO
EDIFYING
IF
ANY
MAN
SPEAK
IN
AN

TONGUE
LET
IT
BE
BY
TWO
OR
AT
THE
MOST
BY
THREE
AND
THAT
BY
COURSE
AND
LET
ONE
INTERPRET
BUT
IF
THERE
BE
NO
INTERPRETER
LET
HIM
KEEP
SILENCE
IN
THE
CHURCH
AND
LET
HIM
SPEAK
TO
HIMSELF
AND
TO
GOD
LET
THE
PROPHETS
SPEAK
TWO
OR
THREE
AND
LET
THE
OTHER
JUDGE
IF
ANY
THING
BE
REVEALED
TO
ANOTHER
THAT
SITTETH
BY
LET
THE
FIRST
HOLD
HIS
PEACE
FOR
YE
MAY
ALL
PROPHESY
ONE
BY
ONE
THAT
ALL
MAY
LEARN
AND
ALL
MAY
BE
COMFORTED
AND
THE
SPIRITS
OF
THE
PROPHETS
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
THE
PROPHETS
FOR
GOD
IS
NOT
THE
AUTHOR
OF
CONFUSION
BUT
OF
PEACE
AS
IN
ALL
CHURCHES
OF
THE
SAINTS
LET
YOUR
WOMEN
KEEP
SILENCE
IN
THE
CHURCHES
FOR
IT
IS
NOT
PERMITTED
UNTO
THEM
TO
SPEAK
BUT
THEY
ARE
COMMANDED
TO
BE
UNDER
OBEDIENCE
AS
ALSO
SAITH
THE
LAW
AND
IF
THEY
WILL
LEARN
ANY
THING
LET
THEM
ASK
THEIR
HUSBANDS
AT
HOME
FOR
IT
IS
A
SHAME
FOR
WOMEN
TO
SPEAK
IN
THE
CHURCH
WHAT
CAME
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
OUT
FROM
YOU
OR
CAME
IT
UNTO
YOU
ONLY
IF
ANY
MAN
THINK
HIMSELF
TO

OR
SPIRITUAL
LET
HIM
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
THINGS
THAT
I
WRITE
UNTO
YOU
ARE
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
THE
LORD
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
BE
IGNORANT
LET
HIM
BE
IGNORANT
WHEREFORE
BRETHREN
COVET
TO
PROPHESY
AND
FORBID
NOT
TO
SPEAK
WITH
TONGUES
LET
ALL
THINGS
BE
DONE
DECENTLY
AND
IN

MOREOVER
BRETHREN
I
DECLARE
UNTO

THE

THAT
HE
WAS
BURIED
AND
THAT
HE
ROSE
AGAIN
THE
THIRD
DAY
ACCORDING
TO
THE

FIVE
HUNDRED
BRETHREN
AT

THE
APOSTLES
AND
LAST
OF
ALL
HE
WAS
SEEN
OF

ALSO
AS

FOR
I
AM
THE
LEAST
OF
THE
APOSTLES
THAT
AM
NOT

TO
BE
CALLED
AN
APOSTLE
BECAUSE
I
PERSECUTED
THE

OF

I
AM
WHAT
I
AM
AND
HIS
GRACE
WHICH
WAS
BESTOWED
UPON

GRACE
OF
GOD
WHICH
WAS
WITH
ME
THEREFORE
WHETHER
IT
WERE
I
OR
THEY
SO
WE
PREACH
AND
SO
YE
BELIEVED
NOW
IF
CHRIST
BE
PREACHED
THAT
HE
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
HOW
SAY
SOME
AMONG
YOU
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
BUT
IF
THERE
BE
NO
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
THEN
IS
CHRIST
NOT
RISEN
AND
IF
CHRIST
BE
NOT
RISEN
THEN
IS
OUR
PREACHING
VAIN
AND
YOUR
FAITH
IS
ALSO
VAIN
YEA
AND
WE
ARE
FOUND
FALSE
WITNESSES
OF
GOD
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
TESTIFIED
OF
GOD
THAT
HE
RAISED
UP
CHRIST
WHOM
HE
RAISED
NOT
UP
IF
SO
BE
THAT
THE
DEAD
RISE
NOT
FOR
IF
THE
DEAD
RISE
NOT
THEN
IS
NOT
CHRIST
RAISED
AND
IF
CHRIST
BE
NOT
RAISED
YOUR
FAITH
IS
VAIN
YE
ARE
YET
IN
YOUR
SINS
THEN
THEY
ALSO
WHICH
ARE
FALLEN
ASLEEP
IN
CHRIST
ARE
PERISHED
IF
IN
THIS
LIFE
ONLY
WE
HAVE
HOPE
IN
CHRIST
WE
ARE
OF
ALL
MEN
MOST
MISERABLE
BUT
NOW
IS
CHRIST
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
BECOME
THE
FIRSTFRUITS
OF
THEM
THAT
SLEPT
FOR
SINCE
BY
MAN
CAME
DEATH
BY
MAN
CAME
ALSO
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
FOR
AS
IN
ADAM
ALL
DIE
EVEN
SO
IN
CHRIST
SHALL
ALL
BE
MADE
ALIVE
BUT
EVERY
MAN
IN
HIS
OWN
ORDER
CHRIST
THE
FIRSTFRUITS
AFTERWARD
THEY
THAT
ARE
CHRIST'S
AT
HIS
COMING
THEN
COMETH
THE
END
WHEN
HE
SHALL
HAVE
DELIVERED
UP
THE
KINGDOM
TO
GOD
EVEN
THE
FATHER
WHEN
HE
SHALL
HAVE
PUT
DOWN
ALL
RULE
AND
ALL
AUTHORITY
AND
POWER
FOR
HE
MUST
REIGN
TILL
HE
HATH
PUT
ALL
ENEMIES
UNDER
HIS
FEET
THE
LAST
ENEMY
THAT
SHALL
BE
DESTROYED
IS
DEATH
FOR
HE
HATH
PUT
ALL
THINGS
UNDER
HIS
FEET
BUT
WHEN
HE
SAITH
ALL
THINGS
ARE
PUT
UNDER
HIM
IT
IS
MANIFEST
THAT
HE
IS
EXCEPTED
WHICH
DID
PUT
ALL
THINGS
UNDER
HIM
AND
WHEN
ALL
THINGS
SHALL
BE
SUBDUED
UNTO
HIM
THEN
SHALL
THE
SON
ALSO
HIMSELF
BE
SUBJECT
UNTO
HIM
THAT
PUT
ALL
THINGS
UNDER
HIM
THAT
GOD
MAY
BE
ALL
IN
ALL
ELSE
WHAT
SHALL
THEY
DO
WHICH
ARE
BAPTIZED
FOR
THE
DEAD
IF
THE
DEAD
RISE
NOT
AT
ALL
WHY
ARE
THEY
THEN
BAPTIZED
FOR
THE
DEAD
AND
WHY
STAND
WE
IN
JEOPARDY
EVERY
HOUR
I
PROTEST
BY
YOUR
REJOICING
WHICH
I
HAVE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
OUR
LORD
I
DIE
DAILY
IF
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
MEN
I
HAVE
FOUGHT
WITH
BEASTS
AT
EPHESUS
WHAT
ADVANTAGETH
IT
ME
IF
THE
DEAD
RISE
NOT
LET
US
EAT
AND
DRINK
FOR
TO
MORROW
WE
DIE
BE
NOT
DECEIVED
EVIL
COMMUNICATIONS
CORRUPT
GOOD
MANNERS
AWAKE
TO
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
SIN
NOT
FOR
SOME
HAVE
NOT
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
I
SPEAK
THIS
TO
YOUR
SHAME
BUT
SOME
MAN
WILL
SAY
HOW
ARE
THE
DEAD
RAISED
UP
AND
WITH
WHAT
BODY
DO
THEY
COME
THOU
FOOL
THAT
WHICH
THOU
SOWEST
IS
NOT
QUICKENED
EXCEPT
IT
DIE
AND
THAT
WHICH
THOU
SOWEST
THOU
SOWEST
NOT
THAT
BODY
THAT
SHALL
BE
BUT
BARE
GRAIN
IT
MAY
CHANCE
OF
WHEAT
OR
OF
SOME
OTHER
GRAIN
BUT
GOD
GIVETH
IT
A
BODY
AS
IT
HATH
PLEASED
HIM
AND
TO
EVERY
SEED
HIS
OWN
BODY
ALL
FLESH
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
FLESH
BUT
THERE
IS
ONE
KIND
OF
FLESH
OF
MEN
ANOTHER
FLESH
OF
BEASTS
ANOTHER
OF
FISHES
AND
ANOTHER
OF
BIRDS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
CELESTIAL
BODIES
AND
BODIES
TERRESTRIAL
BUT
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
CELESTIAL
IS
ONE
AND
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
TERRESTRIAL
IS
ANOTHER
THERE
IS
ONE
GLORY
OF
THE
SUN
AND
ANOTHER
GLORY
OF
THE
MOON
AND
ANOTHER
GLORY
OF
THE
STARS
FOR
ONE
STAR
DIFFERETH
FROM
ANOTHER
STAR
IN
GLORY
SO
ALSO
IS
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
IT
IS
SOWN
IN
CORRUPTION
IT
IS
RAISED
IN
INCORRUPTION
IT
IS
SOWN
IN
DISHONOUR
IT
IS
RAISED
IN
GLORY
IT
IS
SOWN
IN
WEAKNESS
IT
IS
RAISED
IN
POWER
IT
IS
SOWN
A
NATURAL
BODY
IT
IS
RAISED
A
SPIRITUAL
BODY
THERE
IS
A
NATURAL
BODY
AND
THERE
IS
A
SPIRITUAL
BODY
AND
SO
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THE
FIRST
MAN
ADAM
WAS
MADE
A
LIVING
SOUL
THE
LAST
ADAM
WAS
MADE
A
QUICKENING
SPIRIT
HOWBEIT
THAT
WAS
NOT
FIRST
WHICH
IS
SPIRITUAL
BUT
THAT
WHICH
IS
NATURAL
AND
AFTERWARD
THAT
WHICH
IS
SPIRITUAL
THE
FIRST
MAN
IS
OF
THE
EARTH
EARTHY
THE
SECOND
MAN
IS
THE
LORD
FROM
HEAVEN
AS
IS
THE
EARTHY
SUCH
ARE
THEY
ALSO
THAT
ARE
EARTHY
AND
AS
IS
THE
HEAVENLY
SUCH
ARE
THEY
ALSO
THAT
ARE
HEAVENLY
AND
AS
WE
HAVE
BORNE
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
EARTHY
WE
SHALL
ALSO
BEAR
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
HEAVENLY
NOW
THIS
I
SAY
BRETHREN
THAT
FLESH
AND
BLOOD
CANNOT
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
NEITHER
DOTH
CORRUPTION
INHERIT
INCORRUPTION
BEHOLD
I
SHEW
YOU
A
MYSTERY
WE
SHALL
NOT
ALL
SLEEP
BUT
WE
SHALL
ALL
BE
CHANGED
IN
A
MOMENT
IN
THE
TWINKLING
OF
AN
EYE
AT
THE
LAST
TRUMP
FOR
THE
TRUMPET
SHALL
SOUND
AND
THE
DEAD
SHALL
BE
RAISED
INCORRUPTIBLE
AND
WE
SHALL
BE
CHANGED
FOR
THIS
CORRUPTIBLE
MUST
PUT
ON
INCORRUPTION
AND
THIS
MORTAL
MUST
PUT
ON
IMMORTALITY
SO
WHEN
THIS
CORRUPTIBLE
SHALL
HAVE
PUT
ON
INCORRUPTION
AND
THIS
MORTAL
SHALL
HAVE
PUT
ON
IMMORTALITY
THEN
SHALL
BE
BROUGHT
TO
PASS
THE
SAYING
THAT
IS
WRITTEN
DEATH
IS
SWALLOWED
UP
IN
VICTORY
O
DEATH
WHERE
IS
THY
STING
O
GRAVE
WHERE
IS
THY
VICTORY
THE
STING
OF
DEATH
IS
SIN
AND
THE
STRENGTH
OF
SIN
IS
THE
LAW
BUT
THANKS
BE
TO
GOD
WHICH
GIVETH
US
THE
VICTORY
THROUGH
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
THEREFORE
MY
BELOVED
BRETHREN
BE
YE
STEDFAST
UNMOVEABLE
ALWAYS
ABOUNDING
IN
THE
WORK

NOW
CONCERNING
THE
COLLECTION
FOR

FIRST
DAY
OF

WEEK

HIM
THAT

NO
GATHERINGS
WHEN

WHOMSOEVER

AT
EPHESUS
UNTIL
PENTECOST
FOR
A
GREAT
DOOR
AND
EFFECTUAL
IS
OPENED
UNTO
ME
AND
THERE
ARE
MANY
ADVERSARIES
NOW
IF
TIMOTHEUS
COME
SEE
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
WITH
YOU
WITHOUT
FEAR
FOR
HE
WORKETH
THE
WORK
OF
THE
LORD
AS
I
ALSO
DO
LET
NO
MAN
THEREFORE
DESPISE
HIM
BUT
CONDUCT
HIM
FORTH
IN
PEACE
THAT
HE
MAY
COME
UNTO
ME
FOR
I
LOOK
FOR
HIM
WITH
THE
BRETHREN
AS

OUR
BROTHER
APOLLOS
I
GREATLY
DESIRED
HIM
TO

WHEREWITH
WE
OURSELVES
ARE

FOR
AS
THE
SUFFERINGS
OF

ABOUND
IN

SO
OUR
CONSOLATION
ALSO
ABOUNDETH
BY

AND
WHETHER
WE

IS
FOR
YOUR

HAVE
YOU
IGNORANT
OF
OUR
TROUBLE
WHICH
CAME
TO
US
IN
ASIA
THAT
WE
WERE
PRESSED
OUT
OF
MEASURE
ABOVE
STRENGTH
INSOMUCH
THAT
WE
DESPAIRED
EVEN
OF
LIFE
BUT
WE
HAD
THE
SENTENCE
OF
DEATH
IN
OURSELVES
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
TRUST
IN
OURSELVES
BUT
IN
GOD
WHICH
RAISETH
THE
DEAD
WHO
DELIVERED
US
FROM
SO
GREAT
A
DEATH
AND
DOTH
DELIVER
IN
WHOM
WE
TRUST
THAT
HE
WILL
YET
DELIVER
US
YE
ALSO
HELPING
TOGETHER
BY
PRAYER
FOR
US
THAT
FOR
THE
GIFT
BESTOWED
UPON
US
BY
THE
MEANS
OF
MANY
PERSONS
THANKS
MAY
BE
GIVEN
BY
MANY
ON
OUR
BEHALF
FOR
OUR
REJOICING
IS
THIS
THE
TESTIMONY
OF
OUR
CONSCIENCE
THAT
IN
SIMPLICITY
AND
GODLY
SINCERITY
NOT
WITH
FLESHLY
WISDOM
BUT
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
WE
HAVE
HAD
OUR
CONVERSATION
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
MORE
ABUNDANTLY
TO
YOU-WARD
FOR
WE
WRITE
NONE
OTHER
THINGS
UNTO
YOU
THAN
WHAT
YE
READ
OR
ACKNOWLEDGE
AND
I
TRUST
YE
SHALL
ACKNOWLEDGE
EVEN
TO
THE
END
AS
ALSO
YE
HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED
US
IN
PART
THAT
WE
ARE
YOUR
REJOICING
EVEN
AS
YE
ALSO
ARE
OUR'S
IN
THE
DAY
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
AND
IN
THIS
CONFIDENCE
I
WAS
MINDED
TO
COME
UNTO
YOU
BEFORE
THAT
YE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
SECOND
BENEFIT
AND
TO
PASS
BY
YOU
INTO
MACEDONIA
AND
TO
COME
AGAIN
OUT
OF
MACEDONIA
UNTO
YOU
AND
OF
YOU
TO
BE
BROUGHT
ON
MY
WAY
TOWARD
JUDAEA
WHEN
I
THEREFORE
WAS
THUS
MINDED
DID
I
USE
LIGHTNESS
OR
THE
THINGS
THAT
I
PURPOSE
DO
I
PURPOSE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
FLESH
THAT
WITH
ME
THERE
SHOULD
BE
YEA
YEA
AND
NAY
NAY
BUT
AS
GOD
IS
TRUE
OUR
WORD
TOWARD
YOU
WAS
NOT
YEA
AND
NAY
FOR
THE
SON
OF
GOD
JESUS
CHRIST
WHO
WAS
PREACHED
AMONG
YOU
BY
US
EVEN
BY
ME
AND
SILVANUS
AND
TIMOTHEUS
WAS
NOT
YEA
AND
NAY
BUT
IN
HIM
WAS
YEA
FOR
ALL
THE
PROMISES
OF
GOD
IN
HIM
ARE
YEA
AND
IN
HIM
AMEN
UNTO
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
BY
US
NOW
HE
WHICH
STABLISHETH
US
WITH
YOU
IN
CHRIST
AND
HATH
ANOINTED
US
IS
GOD
WHO
HATH
ALSO
SEALED
US
AND
GIVEN
THE
EARNEST
OF
THE
SPIRIT
IN
OUR
HEARTS
MOREOVER
I
CALL
GOD
FOR
A
RECORD
UPON
MY
SOUL
THAT
TO
SPARE
YOU
I
CAME
NOT
AS
YET
UNTO
CORINTH
NOT
FOR
THAT
WE
HAVE
DOMINION
OVER
YOUR
FAITH
BUT
ARE
HELPERS
OF
YOUR
JOY
FOR
BY
FAITH
YE
STAND
BUT
I
DETERMINED
THIS
WITH
MYSELF
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
COME
AGAIN
TO
YOU
IN
HEAVINESS
FOR
IF
I
MAKE
YOU
SORRY
WHO
IS
HE
THEN
THAT
MAKETH
ME
GLAD
BUT
THE
SAME
WHICH
IS
MADE
SORRY
BY
ME
AND
I
WROTE
THIS
SAME
UNTO
YOU
LEST
WHEN
I
CAME
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SORROW
FROM
THEM
OF
WHOM
I
OUGHT
TO
REJOICE
HAVING
CONFIDENCE
IN
YOU
ALL
THAT
MY
JOY
IS
THE
JOY
OF
YOU
ALL
FOR
OUT
OF
MUCH
AFFLICTION
AND
ANGUISH
OF
HEART
I
WROTE
UNTO
YOU
WITH
MANY
TEARS
NOT
THAT
YE
SHOULD
BE
GRIEVED
BUT
THAT
YE
MIGHT
KNOW
THE
LOVE
WHICH
I
HAVE
MORE
ABUNDANTLY
UNTO
YOU
BUT
IF
ANY
HAVE
CAUSED
GRIEF
HE
HATH
NOT
GRIEVED
ME
BUT
IN
PART
THAT
I
MAY
NOT
OVERCHARGE
YOU
ALL
SUFFICIENT
TO
SUCH
A
MAN
IS
THIS
PUNISHMENT
WHICH
WAS
INFLICTED
OF
MANY
SO
THAT
CONTRARIWISE
YE
OUGHT
RATHER
TO
FORGIVE
HIM
AND
COMFORT
HIM
LEST
PERHAPS
SUCH
A
ONE
SHOULD
BE
SWALLOWED
UP
WITH
OVERMUCH
SORROW
WHEREFORE
I
BESEECH
YOU
THAT
YE
WOULD
CONFIRM
YOUR
LOVE
TOWARD
HIM
FOR
TO
THIS
END
ALSO
DID
I
WRITE
THAT
I
MIGHT
KNOW
THE
PROOF
OF
YOU
WHETHER
YE
BE
OBEDIENT
IN
ALL
THINGS
TO
WHOM
YE
FORGIVE
ANY
THING
I
FORGIVE
ALSO
FOR
IF
I
FORGAVE
ANY
THING
TO
WHOM
I
FORGAVE
IT
FOR
YOUR
SAKES
FORGAVE
I
IT
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
CHRIST
LEST
SATAN
SHOULD
GET
AN
ADVANTAGE
OF
US
FOR
WE
ARE
NOT
IGNORANT
OF
HIS
DEVICES
FURTHERMORE
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
TROAS
TO
PREACH
CHRIST'S
GOSPEL
AND
A
DOOR
WAS
OPENED
UNTO
ME
OF
THE
LORD
I
HAD
NO
REST
IN
MY
SPIRIT
BECAUSE
I
FOUND
NOT
TITUS
MY
BROTHER
BUT
TAKING
MY
LEAVE
OF
THEM
I
WENT
FROM
THENCE
INTO
MACEDONIA
NOW
THANKS
BE
UNTO
GOD
WHICH
ALWAYS
CAUSETH
US
TO
TRIUMPH
IN
CHRIST
AND
MAKETH
MANIFEST
THE
SAVOUR
OF
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
BY
US
IN
EVERY
PLACE
FOR
WE
ARE
UNTO
GOD
A
SWEET
SAVOUR
OF
CHRIST
IN
THEM
THAT
ARE
SAVED
AND
IN
THEM
THAT
PERISH
TO
THE
ONE
WE
ARE
THE
SAVOUR
OF
DEATH
UNTO
DEATH
AND
TO
THE
OTHER
THE
SAVOUR
OF
LIFE
UNTO
LIFE
AND
WHO
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THESE
THINGS
FOR
WE
ARE
NOT
AS
MANY
WHICH
CORRUPT
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
BUT
AS
OF
SINCERITY
BUT
AS
OF
GOD
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD
SPEAK
WE
IN
CHRIST
DO
WE
BEGIN
AGAIN
TO
COMMEND
OURSELVES
OR
NEED
WE
AS
SOME
OTHERS
EPISTLES
OF
COMMENDATION
TO
YOU
OR
LETTERS
OF
COMMENDATION
FROM
YOU
YE
ARE
OUR
EPISTLE
WRITTEN
IN
OUR
HEARTS
KNOWN
AND
READ
OF
ALL
MEN
FORASMUCH
AS
YE
ARE
MANIFESTLY
DECLARED
TO
BE
THE
EPISTLE
OF
CHRIST
MINISTERED
BY
US
WRITTEN
NOT
WITH
INK
BUT
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
NOT
IN
TABLES
OF
STONE
BUT
IN
FLESHY
TABLES
OF
THE
HEART
AND
SUCH
TRUST
HAVE
WE
THROUGH
CHRIST
TO
GOD-WARD
NOT
THAT
WE
ARE
SUFFICIENT
OF
OURSELVES
TO
THINK
ANY
THING
AS
OF
OURSELVES
BUT
OUR
SUFFICIENCY
IS
OF
GOD
WHO
ALSO
HATH
MADE
US
ABLE
MINISTERS
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
NOT
OF
THE
LETTER
BUT
OF
THE
SPIRIT
FOR
THE
LETTER
KILLETH
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
GIVETH
LIFE
BUT
IF
THE
MINISTRATION
OF
DEATH
WRITTEN
AND
ENGRAVEN
IN
STONES
WAS
GLORIOUS
SO
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
COULD
NOT
STEDFASTLY
BEHOLD
THE
FACE
OF
MOSES
FOR
THE
GLORY
OF
HIS
COUNTENANCE
WHICH
GLORY
WAS
TO
BE
DONE
AWAY
HOW
SHALL
NOT
THE
MINISTRATION
OF
THE
SPIRIT
BE
RATHER
GLORIOUS
FOR
IF
THE
MINISTRATION
OF
CONDEMNATION
BE
GLORY
MUCH
MORE
DOTH
THE
MINISTRATION
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
EXCEED
IN
GLORY
FOR
EVEN
THAT
WHICH
WAS
MADE
GLORIOUS
HAD
NO
GLORY
IN
THIS
RESPECT
BY
REASON
OF
THE
GLORY
THAT
EXCELLETH
FOR
IF
THAT
WHICH
IS
DONE
AWAY
WAS
GLORIOUS
MUCH
MORE
THAT
WHICH
REMAINETH
IS
GLORIOUS
SEEING
THEN
THAT
WE
HAVE
SUCH
HOPE
WE
USE
GREAT
PLAINNESS
OF
SPEECH
AND
NOT
AS
MOSES
WHICH
PUT
A
VAIL
OVER
HIS
FACE
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
COULD
NOT
STEDFASTLY
LOOK
TO
THE
END
OF
THAT
WHICH
IS
ABOLISHED
BUT
THEIR
MINDS
WERE
BLINDED
FOR
UNTIL
THIS
DAY
REMAINETH
THE
SAME
VAIL
UNTAKEN
AWAY
IN
THE
READING
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
WHICH
VAIL
IS
DONE
AWAY
IN
CHRIST
BUT
EVEN
UNTO
THIS
DAY
WHEN
MOSES
IS
READ
THE
VAIL
IS
UPON
THEIR
HEART
NEVERTHELESS
WHEN
IT
SHALL
TURN
TO
THE
LORD
THE
VAIL
SHALL
BE
TAKEN
AWAY
NOW
THE
LORD
IS
THAT
SPIRIT
AND
WHERE
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
LORD
IS
THERE
IS
LIBERTY
BUT
WE
ALL
WITH
OPEN
FACE
BEHOLDING
AS
IN
A
GLASS
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
LORD
ARE
CHANGED
INTO
THE
SAME
IMAGE
FROM
GLORY
TO
GLORY
EVEN
AS
BY
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
LORD
THEREFORE
SEEING
WE
HAVE
THIS
MINISTRY
AS
WE
HAVE
RECEIVED
MERCY
WE
FAINT
NOT
BUT
HAVE
RENOUNCED
THE
HIDDEN
THINGS
OF
DISHONESTY
NOT
WALKING
IN
CRAFTINESS
NOR
HANDLING
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
DECEITFULLY
BUT
BY
MANIFESTATION
OF
THE
TRUTH
COMMENDING
OURSELVES
TO
EVERY
MAN'S
CONSCIENCE
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD
BUT
IF
OUR
GOSPEL
BE
HID
IT
IS
HID
TO
THEM
THAT
ARE
LOST
IN
WHOM
THE
GOD
OF
THIS
WORLD
HATH
BLINDED
THE
MINDS
OF
THEM
WHICH
BELIEVE
NOT
LEST
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
GLORIOUS
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
WHO
IS
THE
IMAGE
OF
GOD
SHOULD
SHINE
UNTO
THEM
FOR
WE
PREACH
NOT
OURSELVES
BUT
CHRIST
JESUS
THE
LORD
AND
OURSELVES
YOUR
SERVANTS
FOR
JESUS'
SAKE
FOR
GOD
WHO
COMMANDED
THE
LIGHT
TO
SHINE
OUT
OF
DARKNESS
HATH
SHINED
IN
OUR
HEARTS
TO
GIVE
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
IN
THE
FACE
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
BUT
WE
HAVE
THIS
TREASURE
IN
EARTHEN
VESSELS
THAT
THE
EXCELLENCY
OF
THE
POWER
MAY
BE
OF
GOD
AND
NOT
OF
US
WE
ARE
TROUBLED
ON
EVERY
SIDE
YET
NOT
DISTRESSED
WE
ARE
PERPLEXED
BUT
NOT
IN
DESPAIR
PERSECUTED
BUT
NOT
FORSAKEN
CAST
DOWN
BUT
NOT
DESTROYED
ALWAYS
BEARING
ABOUT
IN
THE
BODY
THE
DYING
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
THAT
THE
LIFE
ALSO
OF
JESUS
MIGHT
BE
MADE
MANIFEST
IN
OUR
BODY
FOR
WE
WHICH
LIVE
ARE
ALWAY
DELIVERED
UNTO
DEATH
FOR
JESUS'
SAKE
THAT
THE
LIFE
ALSO
OF
JESUS
MIGHT
BE
MADE
MANIFEST
IN
OUR
MORTAL
FLESH
SO
THEN
DEATH
WORKETH
IN
US
BUT
LIFE
IN
YOU
WE
HAVING
THE
SAME
SPIRIT
OF
FAITH
ACCORDING
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
I
BELIEVED
AND
THEREFORE
HAVE
I
SPOKEN
WE
ALSO
BELIEVE
AND
THEREFORE
SPEAK
KNOWING
THAT
HE
WHICH
RAISED
UP
THE
LORD
JESUS
SHALL
RAISE
UP
US
ALSO
BY
JESUS
AND
SHALL
PRESENT
US
WITH
YOU
FOR
ALL
THINGS
ARE
FOR
YOUR
SAKES
THAT
THE
ABUNDANT
GRACE
MIGHT
THROUGH
THE
THANKSGIVING
OF
MANY
REDOUND
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
FOR
WHICH
CAUSE
WE
FAINT
NOT
BUT
THOUGH
OUR
OUTWARD
MAN
PERISH
YET
THE
INWARD
MAN
IS
RENEWED
DAY
BY
DAY
FOR
OUR
LIGHT
AFFLICTION
WHICH
IS
BUT
FOR
A
MOMENT
WORKETH
FOR
US
A
FAR
MORE
EXCEEDING
AND
ETERNAL
WEIGHT
OF
GLORY
WHILE
WE
LOOK
NOT
AT
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
SEEN
BUT
AT
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
SEEN
FOR
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
SEEN
ARE
TEMPORAL
BUT
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
SEEN
ARE
ETERNAL
FOR
WE
KNOW
THAT
IF
OUR
EARTHLY
HOUSE
OF
THIS
TABERNACLE
WERE
DISSOLVED
WE
HAVE
A
BUILDING
OF
GOD
AN
HOUSE
NOT
MADE
WITH
HANDS
ETERNAL
IN
THE
HEAVENS
FOR
IN
THIS
WE
GROAN
EARNESTLY
DESIRING
TO
BE
CLOTHED
UPON
WITH
OUR
HOUSE
WHICH
IS
FROM
HEAVEN
IF
SO
BE
THAT
BEING
CLOTHED
WE
SHALL
NOT
BE
FOUND
NAKED
FOR
WE
THAT
ARE
IN
THIS
TABERNACLE
DO
GROAN
BEING
BURDENED
NOT
FOR
THAT
WE
WOULD
BE
UNCLOTHED
BUT
CLOTHED
UPON
THAT
MORTALITY
MIGHT
BE
SWALLOWED
UP
OF
LIFE
NOW
HE
THAT
HATH
WROUGHT
US
FOR
THE
SELFSAME
THING
IS
GOD
WHO
ALSO
HATH
GIVEN
UNTO
US
THE
EARNEST
OF
THE
SPIRIT
THEREFORE
WE
ARE
ALWAYS
CONFIDENT
KNOWING
THAT
WHILST
WE
ARE
AT
HOME
IN
THE
BODY
WE
ARE
ABSENT
FROM
THE
LORD
FOR
WE
WALK
BY
FAITH
NOT
BY
SIGHT
WE
ARE
CONFIDENT
I
SAY
AND
WILLING
RATHER
TO
BE
ABSENT
FROM
THE
BODY
AND
TO
BE
PRESENT
WITH
THE
LORD
WHEREFORE
WE
LABOUR
THAT
WHETHER
PRESENT
OR
ABSENT
WE
MAY
BE
ACCEPTED
OF
HIM
FOR
WE
MUST
ALL
APPEAR
BEFORE
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
OF
CHRIST
THAT
EVERY
ONE
MAY
RECEIVE
THE
THINGS
DONE
IN
HIS
BODY
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
HE
HATH
DONE
WHETHER
IT
BE
GOOD
OR
BAD
KNOWING
THEREFORE
THE
TERROR
OF
THE
LORD
WE
PERSUADE
MEN
BUT
WE
ARE
MADE
MANIFEST
UNTO
GOD
AND
I
TRUST
ALSO
ARE
MADE
MANIFEST
IN
YOUR
CONSCIENCES
FOR
WE
COMMEND
NOT
OURSELVES
AGAIN
UNTO
YOU
BUT
GIVE
YOU
OCCASION
TO
GLORY
ON
OUR
BEHALF
THAT
YE
MAY
HAVE
SOMEWHAT
TO
ANSWER
THEM
WHICH
GLORY
IN
APPEARANCE
AND
NOT
IN
HEART
FOR
WHETHER
WE
BE
BESIDE
OURSELVES
IT
IS
TO
GOD
OR
WHETHER
WE
BE
SOBER
IT
IS
FOR
YOUR
CAUSE
FOR
THE
LOVE
OF
CHRIST
CONSTRAINETH
US
BECAUSE
WE
THUS
JUDGE
THAT
IF
ONE
DIED
FOR
ALL
THEN
WERE
ALL
DEAD
AND
THAT
HE
DIED
FOR
ALL
THAT
THEY
WHICH
LIVE
SHOULD
NOT
HENCEFORTH
LIVE
UNTO
THEMSELVES
BUT
UNTO
HIM
WHICH
DIED
FOR
THEM
AND
ROSE
AGAIN
WHEREFORE
HENCEFORTH
KNOW
WE
NO
MAN
AFTER
THE
FLESH
YEA
THOUGH
WE
HAVE
KNOWN
CHRIST
AFTER
THE
FLESH
YET
NOW
HENCEFORTH
KNOW
WE
HIM
NO
MORE
THEREFORE
IF
ANY
MAN
BE
IN
CHRIST
HE
IS
A
NEW
CREATURE
OLD
THINGS
ARE
PASSED
AWAY
BEHOLD
ALL
THINGS
ARE
BECOME
NEW
AND
ALL
THINGS
ARE
OF
GOD
WHO
HATH
RECONCILED
US
TO
HIMSELF
BY
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
HATH
GIVEN
TO
US
THE
MINISTRY
OF
RECONCILIATION
TO
WIT
THAT
GOD
WAS
IN
CHRIST
RECONCILING
THE
WORLD
UNTO
HIMSELF
NOT
IMPUTING
THEIR
TRESPASSES
UNTO
THEM
AND
HATH
COMMITTED
UNTO
US
THE
WORD
OF
RECONCILIATION
NOW
THEN
WE
ARE
AMBASSADORS
FOR
CHRIST
AS
THOUGH
GOD
DID
BESEECH
YOU
BY
US
WE
PRAY
YOU
IN
CHRIST'S
STEAD
BE
YE
RECONCILED
TO
GOD
FOR
HE
HATH
MADE
HIM
TO
BE
SIN
FOR
US
WHO
KNEW
NO
SIN
THAT
WE
MIGHT
BE
MADE
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
IN
HIM
WE
THEN
AS
WORKERS
TOGETHER
WITH
HIM
BESEECH
YOU
ALSO
THAT
YE
RECEIVE
NOT
THE

IN
VAIN
FOR

I
AM
NOT

ALL

TO
YOU
IN

EVEN
SO
OUR
BOASTING
WHICH
I
MADE
BEFORE
TITUS
IS
FOUND
A
TRUTH
AND
HIS
INWARD
AFFECTION
IS
MORE
ABUNDANT
TOWARD
YOU
WHILST
HE
REMEMBERETH
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
YOU
ALL
HOW
WITH
FEAR
AND
TREMBLING
YE
RECEIVED
HIM
I
REJOICE
THEREFORE
THAT
I
HAVE

IN

MOREOVER
BRETHREN
WE
DO
YOU
TO
WIT
OF
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
BESTOWED
ON
THE
CHURCHES
OF
MACEDONIA
HOW
THAT
IN
A
GREAT
TRIAL
OF
AFFLICTION
THE
ABUNDANCE
OF
THEIR
JOY
AND
THEIR
DEEP
POVERTY
ABOUNDED
UNTO
THE
RICHES
OF
THEIR
LIBERALITY
FOR
TO
THEIR
POWER
I
BEAR
RECORD
YEA
AND
BEYOND
THEIR
POWER
THEY
WERE
WILLING
OF
THEMSELVES
PRAYING
US
WITH
MUCH
INTREATY
THAT
WE
WOULD
RECEIVE
THE
GIFT
AND
TAKE
UPON
US
THE
FELLOWSHIP
OF
THE
MINISTERING
TO
THE
SAINTS
AND
THIS
THEY
DID
NOT
AS
WE
HOPED
BUT
FIRST
GAVE
THEIR
OWN
SELVES
TO
THE
LORD
AND
UNTO
US
BY
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
INSOMUCH
THAT
WE
DESIRED
TITUS
THAT
AS
HE
HAD
BEGUN
SO
HE
WOULD
ALSO
FINISH
IN
YOU
THE
SAME
GRACE
ALSO
THEREFORE
AS
YE
ABOUND
IN
EVERY
THING
IN
FAITH
AND
UTTERANCE
AND
KNOWLEDGE
AND
IN
ALL
DILIGENCE
AND
IN
YOUR
LOVE
TO
US
SEE
THAT
YE
ABOUND
IN
THIS
GRACE
ALSO
I
SPEAK
NOT
BY
COMMANDMENT
BUT
BY
OCCASION
OF
THE
FORWARDNESS
OF
OTHERS
AND
TO
PROVE
THE
SINCERITY
OF
YOUR
LOVE
FOR
YE
KNOW
THE
GRACE
OF
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
THAT
THOUGH
HE
WAS
RICH
YET
FOR
YOUR
SAKES
HE
BECAME
POOR
THAT
YE
THROUGH
HIS
POVERTY
MIGHT
BE
RICH
AND
HEREIN
I
GIVE
MY
ADVICE
FOR
THIS
IS
EXPEDIENT
FOR
YOU
WHO
HAVE
BEGUN
BEFORE
NOT
ONLY
TO
DO
BUT
ALSO
TO
BE
FORWARD
A
YEAR
AGO
NOW
THEREFORE
PERFORM
THE
DOING
OF
IT
THAT
AS
THERE
WAS
A
READINESS
TO
WILL
SO
THERE
MAY
BE
A
PERFORMANCE
ALSO
OUT
OF
THAT
WHICH
YE
HAVE
FOR
IF
THERE
BE
FIRST
A
WILLING
MIND
IT
IS
ACCEPTED
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
A
MAN
HATH
AND
NOT
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
HE
HATH
NOT
FOR
I
MEAN
NOT
THAT
OTHER
MEN
BE
EASED
AND
YE
BURDENED
BUT
BY
AN
EQUALITY
THAT
NOW
AT
THIS
TIME
YOUR
ABUNDANCE
MAY
BE
A
SUPPLY
FOR
THEIR
WANT
THAT
THEIR
ABUNDANCE
ALSO
MAY
BE
A
SUPPLY
FOR
YOUR
WANT
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
EQUALITY
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
HE
THAT
HAD
GATHERED
MUCH
HAD
NOTHING
OVER
AND
HE
THAT
HAD
GATHERED
LITTLE
HAD
NO
LACK
BUT
THANKS
BE
TO
GOD
WHICH
PUT
THE
SAME
EARNEST
CARE
INTO
THE
HEART
OF
TITUS
FOR
YOU
FOR
INDEED
HE
ACCEPTED
THE
EXHORTATION
BUT
BEING
MORE
FORWARD
OF
HIS
OWN
ACCORD
HE
WENT
UNTO
YOU
AND
WE
HAVE
SENT
WITH
HIM
THE
BROTHER
WHOSE
PRAISE
IS
IN
THE
GOSPEL
THROUGHOUT
ALL
THE
CHURCHES
AND
NOT
THAT
ONLY
BUT
WHO
WAS
ALSO
CHOSEN
OF
THE
CHURCHES
TO
TRAVEL
WITH
US
WITH
THIS
GRACE
WHICH
IS
ADMINISTERED
BY
US
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
SAME
LORD
AND
DECLARATION
OF
YOUR
READY
MIND
AVOIDING
THIS
THAT
NO
MAN
SHOULD
BLAME
US
IN
THIS
ABUNDANCE
WHICH
IS
ADMINISTERED
BY
US
PROVIDING
FOR
HONEST
THINGS
NOT
ONLY
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
BUT
ALSO
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
MEN
AND
WE
HAVE
SENT
WITH
THEM
OUR
BROTHER
WHOM
WE
HAVE
OFTENTIMES
PROVED
DILIGENT
IN
MANY
THINGS
BUT
NOW
MUCH
MORE
DILIGENT
UPON
THE
GREAT
CONFIDENCE
WHICH
I
HAVE
IN
YOU
WHETHER
ANY
DO
ENQUIRE
OF
TITUS
HE
IS
MY
PARTNER
AND
FELLOWHELPER
CONCERNING
YOU
OR
OUR
BRETHREN
BE
ENQUIRED
OF
THEY
ARE
THE
MESSENGERS
OF
THE
CHURCHES
AND
THE
GLORY
OF
CHRIST
WHEREFORE
SHEW
YE
TO
THEM
AND
BEFORE
THE
CHURCHES
THE
PROOF
OF
YOUR
LOVE
AND
OF
OUR
BOASTING
ON
YOUR
BEHALF
FOR
AS
TOUCHING
THE
MINISTERING
TO
THE
SAINTS
IT
IS
SUPERFLUOUS
FOR
ME
TO
WRITE
TO
YOU
FOR
I
KNOW
THE
FORWARDNESS
OF
YOUR
MIND
FOR
WHICH
I
BOAST
OF
YOU
TO
THEM
OF
MACEDONIA
THAT
ACHAIA
WAS
READY
A
YEAR
AGO
AND
YOUR
ZEAL
HATH
PROVOKED
VERY
MANY
YET
HAVE
I
SENT
THE
BRETHREN
LEST
OUR
BOASTING
OF
YOU
SHOULD
BE
IN
VAIN
IN
THIS
BEHALF
THAT
AS
I
SAID
YE
MAY
BE
READY
LEST
HAPLY
IF
THEY
OF
MACEDONIA
COME
WITH
ME
AND
FIND
YOU
UNPREPARED
WE
THAT
WE
SAY
NOT
YE
SHOULD
BE
ASHAMED
IN
THIS
SAME
CONFIDENT
BOASTING
THEREFORE
I
THOUGHT
IT
NECESSARY
TO
EXHORT
THE
BRETHREN
THAT
THEY
WOULD
GO
BEFORE
UNTO
YOU
AND
MAKE
UP
BEFOREHAND
YOUR
BOUNTY
WHEREOF
YE
HAD
NOTICE
BEFORE
THAT
THE
SAME
MIGHT
BE
READY
AS
A
MATTER
OF
BOUNTY
AND
NOT
AS
OF
COVETOUSNESS
BUT
THIS
I
SAY
HE
WHICH
SOWETH
SPARINGLY
SHALL
REAP
ALSO
SPARINGLY
AND
HE
WHICH
SOWETH
BOUNTIFULLY
SHALL
REAP
ALSO
BOUNTIFULLY
EVERY
MAN
ACCORDING
AS
HE
PURPOSETH
IN
HIS
HEART
SO
LET
HIM
GIVE
NOT
GRUDGINGLY
OR
OF
NECESSITY
FOR
GOD
LOVETH
A
CHEERFUL
GIVER
AND
GOD
IS
ABLE
TO
MAKE
ALL
GRACE
ABOUND
TOWARD
YOU
THAT
YE
ALWAYS
HAVING
ALL
SUFFICIENCY
IN
ALL
THINGS
MAY
ABOUND
TO
EVERY
GOOD
WORK
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
HE
HATH
DISPERSED
ABROAD
HE
HATH
GIVEN
TO
THE
POOR
HIS
RIGHTEOUSNESS
REMAINETH
FOR
EVER
NOW
HE
THAT
MINISTERETH
SEED
TO
THE
SOWER
BOTH
MINISTER
BREAD
FOR
YOUR
FOOD
AND
MULTIPLY
YOUR
SEED
SOWN
AND
INCREASE
THE
FRUITS
OF
YOUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BEING
ENRICHED
IN
EVERY
THING
TO
ALL
BOUNTIFULNESS
WHICH
CAUSETH
THROUGH
US
THANKSGIVING
TO
GOD
FOR
THE
ADMINISTRATION
OF
THIS
SERVICE
NOT
ONLY
SUPPLIETH
THE
WANT
OF
THE
SAINTS
BUT
IS
ABUNDANT
ALSO
BY
MANY
THANKSGIVINGS
UNTO
GOD
WHILES
BY
THE
EXPERIMENT
OF
THIS
MINISTRATION
THEY
GLORIFY
GOD
FOR
YOUR
PROFESSED
SUBJECTION
UNTO
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
AND
FOR
YOUR
LIBERAL
DISTRIBUTION
UNTO
THEM
AND
UNTO
ALL
MEN
AND
BY
THEIR
PRAYER
FOR
YOU
WHICH
LONG
AFTER
YOU
FOR
THE
EXCEEDING
GRACE
OF
GOD
IN
YOU
THANKS
BE
UNTO
GOD
FOR
HIS
UNSPEAKABLE
GIFT
NOW
I
PAUL
MYSELF
BESEECH
YOU
BY
THE
MEEKNESS
AND
GENTLENESS
OF
CHRIST
WHO
IN
PRESENCE
AM
BASE
AMONG
YOU
BUT
BEING
ABSENT
AM
BOLD
TOWARD
YOU
BUT
I
BESEECH
YOU
THAT
I
MAY
NOT
BE
BOLD
WHEN
I
AM
PRESENT
WITH
THAT
CONFIDENCE
WHEREWITH
I
THINK
TO
BE
BOLD
AGAINST
SOME
WHICH
THINK
OF
US
AS
IF
WE
WALKED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
FLESH
FOR
THOUGH
WE
WALK
IN
THE
FLESH
WE
DO
NOT
WAR
AFTER
THE
FLESH
FOR
THE
WEAPONS
OF
OUR
WARFARE
ARE
NOT
CARNAL
BUT
MIGHTY
THROUGH
GOD
TO
THE
PULLING
DOWN
OF
STRONG
HOLDS
CASTING
DOWN
IMAGINATIONS
AND
EVERY
HIGH
THING
THAT
EXALTETH
ITSELF
AGAINST
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
AND
BRINGING
INTO
CAPTIVITY
EVERY
THOUGHT
TO
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
CHRIST
AND
HAVING
IN
A
READINESS
TO
REVENGE
ALL
DISOBEDIENCE
WHEN
YOUR
OBEDIENCE
IS
FULFILLED
DO
YE
LOOK
ON
THINGS
AFTER
THE
OUTWARD
APPEARANCE
IF
ANY
MAN
TRUST
TO
HIMSELF
THAT
HE
IS
CHRIST'S
LET
HIM
OF
HIMSELF
THINK
THIS
AGAIN
THAT
AS
HE
IS
CHRIST'S
EVEN
SO
ARE
WE
CHRIST'S
FOR
THOUGH
I
SHOULD
BOAST
SOMEWHAT
MORE
OF
OUR
AUTHORITY
WHICH
THE
LORD
HATH
GIVEN
US
FOR
EDIFICATION
AND
NOT
FOR
YOUR
DESTRUCTION
I
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ASHAMED
THAT
I
MAY
NOT
SEEM
AS
IF
I
WOULD
TERRIFY
YOU
BY
LETTERS
FOR
HIS
LETTERS
SAY
THEY
ARE
WEIGHTY
AND
POWERFUL
BUT
HIS
BODILY
PRESENCE
IS
WEAK
AND
HIS
SPEECH
CONTEMPTIBLE
LET
SUCH
AN
ONE
THINK
THIS
THAT
SUCH
AS
WE
ARE
IN
WORD
BY
LETTERS
WHEN
WE
ARE
ABSENT
SUCH
WILL
WE
BE
ALSO
IN
DEED
WHEN
WE
ARE
PRESENT
FOR
WE
DARE
NOT
MAKE
OURSELVES
OF
THE
NUMBER
OR
COMPARE
OURSELVES
WITH
SOME
THAT
COMMEND
THEMSELVES
BUT
THEY
MEASURING
THEMSELVES
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
COMPARING
THEMSELVES
AMONG
THEMSELVES
ARE
NOT
WISE
BUT
WE
WILL
NOT
BOAST
OF
THINGS
WITHOUT
OUR
MEASURE
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
MEASURE
OF
THE
RULE
WHICH
GOD
HATH
DISTRIBUTED
TO
US
A
MEASURE
TO
REACH
EVEN
UNTO
YOU
FOR
WE
STRETCH
NOT
OURSELVES
BEYOND
OUR
MEASURE
AS
THOUGH
WE
REACHED
NOT
UNTO
YOU
FOR
WE
ARE
COME
AS
FAR
AS
TO
YOU
ALSO
IN
PREACHING
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
NOT
BOASTING
OF
THINGS
WITHOUT
OUR
MEASURE
THAT
IS
OF
OTHER
MEN'S
LABOURS
BUT
HAVING
HOPE
WHEN
YOUR
FAITH
IS
INCREASED
THAT
WE
SHALL
BE
ENLARGED
BY
YOU
ACCORDING
TO
OUR
RULE
ABUNDANTLY
TO
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
IN
THE
REGIONS
BEYOND
YOU
AND
NOT
TO
BOAST
IN
ANOTHER
MAN'S
LINE
OF
THINGS
MADE
READY
TO
OUR
HAND
BUT
HE
THAT
GLORIETH
LET
HIM
GLORY
IN
THE
LORD
FOR
NOT
HE
THAT
COMMENDETH
HIMSELF
IS
APPROVED
BUT
WHOM
THE
LORD
COMMENDETH
WOULD
TO
GOD
YE
COULD
BEAR
WITH
ME
A
LITTLE
IN
MY
FOLLY
AND
INDEED
BEAR
WITH
ME
FOR
I
AM
JEALOUS
OVER
YOU
WITH
GODLY
JEALOUSY
FOR
I
HAVE
ESPOUSED
YOU
TO
ONE
HUSBAND
THAT
I
MAY
PRESENT
YOU
AS
A
CHASTE
VIRGIN
TO
CHRIST
BUT
I
FEAR
LEST
BY
ANY
MEANS
AS
THE
SERPENT
BEGUILED
EVE
THROUGH
HIS
SUBTILTY
SO
YOUR
MINDS
SHOULD
BE
CORRUPTED
FROM
THE
SIMPLICITY
THAT
IS
IN
CHRIST
FOR
IF
HE
THAT
COMETH
PREACHETH
ANOTHER
JESUS
WHOM
WE
HAVE
NOT
PREACHED
OR
IF
YE
RECEIVE
ANOTHER
SPIRIT
WHICH
YE
HAVE
NOT
RECEIVED
OR
ANOTHER
GOSPEL
WHICH
YE
HAVE
NOT
ACCEPTED
YE
MIGHT
WELL
BEAR
WITH
HIM
FOR
I
SUPPOSE
I
WAS
NOT
A
WHIT
BEHIND
THE
VERY
CHIEFEST
APOSTLES
BUT
THOUGH
I
BE
RUDE
IN
SPEECH
YET
NOT
IN
KNOWLEDGE
BUT
WE
HAVE
BEEN
THROUGHLY
MADE
MANIFEST
AMONG
YOU
IN
ALL
THINGS
HAVE
I
COMMITTED
AN
OFFENCE
IN
ABASING
MYSELF
THAT
YE
MIGHT
BE
EXALTED
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
PREACHED
TO
YOU
THE
GOSPEL
OF
GOD
FREELY
I
ROBBED
OTHER
CHURCHES
TAKING
WAGES
OF
THEM
TO
DO
YOU
SERVICE
AND
WHEN
I
WAS
PRESENT
WITH
YOU
AND
WANTED
I
WAS
CHARGEABLE
TO
NO
MAN
FOR
THAT
WHICH
WAS
LACKING
TO
ME
THE
BRETHREN
WHICH
CAME
FROM
MACEDONIA
SUPPLIED
AND
IN
ALL
THINGS
I
HAVE
KEPT
MYSELF
FROM
BEING
BURDENSOME
UNTO
YOU
AND
SO
WILL
I
KEEP
MYSELF
AS
THE
TRUTH
OF
CHRIST
IS
IN
ME
NO
MAN
SHALL
STOP
ME
OF
THIS
BOASTING
IN
THE
REGIONS
OF
ACHAIA
WHEREFORE
BECAUSE
I
LOVE
YOU
NOT
GOD
KNOWETH
BUT
WHAT
I
DO
THAT
I
WILL
DO
THAT
I
MAY
CUT
OFF
OCCASION
FROM
THEM
WHICH
DESIRE
OCCASION
THAT
WHEREIN
THEY
GLORY
THEY
MAY
BE
FOUND
EVEN
AS
WE
FOR
SUCH
ARE
FALSE
APOSTLES
DECEITFUL
WORKERS
TRANSFORMING
THEMSELVES
INTO
THE
APOSTLES
OF
CHRIST
AND
NO
MARVEL
FOR
SATAN
HIMSELF
IS
TRANSFORMED
INTO
AN
ANGEL
OF
LIGHT
THEREFORE
IT
IS
NO
GREAT
THING
IF
HIS
MINISTERS
ALSO
BE
TRANSFORMED
AS
THE
MINISTERS
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHOSE
END
SHALL
BE
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
WORKS
I
SAY
AGAIN
LET
NO
MAN
THINK
ME
A
FOOL
IF
OTHERWISE
YET
AS
A
FOOL
RECEIVE
ME
THAT
I
MAY
BOAST
MYSELF
A
LITTLE
THAT
WHICH
I
SPEAK
I
SPEAK
IT
NOT
AFTER
THE
LORD
BUT
AS
IT
WERE
FOOLISHLY
IN
THIS
CONFIDENCE
OF
BOASTING
SEEING
THAT
MANY
GLORY
AFTER
THE
FLESH
I
WILL
GLORY
ALSO
FOR
YE
SUFFER
FOOLS
GLADLY
SEEING
YE
YOURSELVES
ARE
WISE
FOR
YE
SUFFER
IF
A
MAN
BRING
YOU
INTO
BONDAGE
IF
A

DEVOUR
YOU
IF
A
MAN

OF

HIMSELF
IF
A

THERE
WAS

A

IN

THE

FOR

I
BESOUGHT
THE

TO
ALL
OTHER
THAT
IF

I
WILL
NOT
SPARE
SINCE
YE
SEEK
A
PROOF
OF
CHRIST
SPEAKING
IN
ME
WHICH
TO
YOU-WARD
IS
NOT
WEAK
BUT
IS
MIGHTY
IN
YOU
FOR
THOUGH
HE
WAS
CRUCIFIED
THROUGH
WEAKNESS
YET
HE
LIVETH
BY
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
FOR
WE
ALSO
ARE
WEAK
IN
HIM
BUT
WE
SHALL
LIVE
WITH
HIM
BY
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
TOWARD
YOU
EXAMINE
YOURSELVES
WHETHER
YE
BE

PROVE
YOUR

HOW
THAT
JESUS

REPROBATES
BUT
I
TRUST
THAT
YE
SHALL
KNOW
THAT
WE
ARE
NOT
REPROBATES
NOW
I
PRAY
TO
GOD
THAT
YE
DO
NO
EVIL
NOT
THAT
WE
SHOULD
APPEAR
APPROVED
BUT
THAT
YE
SHOULD
DO
THAT
WHICH
IS
HONEST
THOUGH
WE
BE
AS
REPROBATES
FOR
WE
CAN
DO
NOTHING
AGAINST
THE
TRUTH
BUT
FOR
THE
TRUTH
FOR
WE
ARE
GLAD
WHEN
WE
ARE
WEAK
AND
YE
ARE
STRONG
AND
THIS
ALSO
WE
WISH
EVEN
YOUR
PERFECTION
THEREFORE
I
WRITE
THESE
THINGS
BEING
ABSENT
LEST
BEING

I
SHOULD
USE
SHARPNESS
ACCORDING

THE
POWER
WHICH
THE
LORD
HATH
GIVEN

EDIFICATION
AND
NOT
TO
DESTRUCTION
FINALLY

AMEN
PAUL
AN
APOSTLE
NOT
OF
MEN
NEITHER
BY
MAN
BUT
BY
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
GOD
THE
FATHER
WHO
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
ALL
THE
BRETHREN
WHICH
ARE
WITH
ME
UNTO
THE
CHURCHES
OF
GALATIA
GRACE
BE
TO
YOU
AND
PEACE
FROM
GOD
THE
FATHER
AND
FROM
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
WHO
GAVE
HIMSELF
FOR
OUR
SINS
THAT
HE
MIGHT
DELIVER
US
FROM
THIS
PRESENT
EVIL
WORLD
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
AND
OUR
FATHER
TO
WHOM
BE
GLORY
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER
AMEN
I
MARVEL
THAT
YE
ARE
SO
SOON
REMOVED
FROM
HIM
THAT
CALLED
YOU
INTO
THE
GRACE
OF
CHRIST
UNTO
ANOTHER
GOSPEL
WHICH
IS
NOT
ANOTHER
BUT
THERE
BE
SOME
THAT
TROUBLE
YOU
AND
WOULD
PERVERT
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
BUT
THOUGH
WE
OR
AN
ANGEL
FROM
HEAVEN
PREACH
ANY
OTHER
GOSPEL
UNTO
YOU
THAN
THAT
WHICH
WE
HAVE
PREACHED
UNTO
YOU
LET
HIM
BE
ACCURSED
AS
WE
SAID
BEFORE
SO
SAY
I
NOW
AGAIN
IF
ANY
MAN
PREACH
ANY
OTHER
GOSPEL
UNTO
YOU
THAN
THAT
YE
HAVE
RECEIVED
LET
HIM
BE
ACCURSED
FOR
DO
I
NOW
PERSUADE
MEN
OR
GOD
OR
DO
I
SEEK
TO
PLEASE
MEN
FOR
IF
I
YET
PLEASED
MEN
I
SHOULD
NOT
BE
THE
SERVANT
OF
CHRIST
BUT
I
CERTIFY
YOU
BRETHREN
THAT
THE
GOSPEL
WHICH
WAS
PREACHED
OF
ME
IS
NOT
AFTER
MAN
FOR
I
NEITHER
RECEIVED
IT
OF
MAN
NEITHER
WAS
I
TAUGHT
IT
BUT
BY
THE
REVELATION
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
FOR
YE
HAVE
HEARD
OF
MY
CONVERSATION
IN
TIME
PAST
IN
THE
JEWS'
RELIGION
HOW
THAT
BEYOND
MEASURE
I
PERSECUTED
THE
CHURCH
OF
GOD
AND
WASTED
IT
AND
PROFITED
IN
THE
JEWS'
RELIGION
ABOVE
MANY
MY
EQUALS
IN
MINE
OWN
NATION
BEING
MORE
EXCEEDINGLY
ZEALOUS
OF
THE
TRADITIONS
OF
MY
FATHERS
BUT
WHEN
IT
PLEASED
GOD
WHO
SEPARATED
ME
FROM
MY
MOTHER'S
WOMB
AND
CALLED
ME
BY
HIS
GRACE
TO
REVEAL
HIS
SON
IN
ME
THAT
I
MIGHT
PREACH
HIM
AMONG
THE
HEATHEN
IMMEDIATELY
I
CONFERRED
NOT
WITH
FLESH
AND
BLOOD
NEITHER
WENT
I
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
TO
THEM
WHICH
WERE
APOSTLES
BEFORE
ME
BUT
I
WENT
INTO
ARABIA
AND
RETURNED
AGAIN
UNTO
DAMASCUS
THEN
AFTER
THREE
YEARS
I
WENT
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
TO
SEE
PETER
AND
ABODE
WITH
HIM
FIFTEEN
DAYS
BUT
OTHER
OF
THE
APOSTLES
SAW
I
NONE
SAVE
JAMES
THE
LORD'S
BROTHER
NOW
THE
THINGS
WHICH
I
WRITE
UNTO
YOU
BEHOLD
BEFORE
GOD
I
LIE
NOT
AFTERWARDS
I
CAME
INTO
THE
REGIONS
OF
SYRIA
AND
CILICIA
AND
WAS
UNKNOWN
BY
FACE
UNTO
THE
CHURCHES
OF
JUDAEA
WHICH
WERE
IN
CHRIST
BUT
THEY
HAD
HEARD
ONLY
THAT
HE
WHICH
PERSECUTED
US
IN
TIMES
PAST
NOW
PREACHETH
THE
FAITH
WHICH
ONCE
HE
DESTROYED
AND
THEY
GLORIFIED
GOD
IN
ME
THEN
FOURTEEN
YEARS
AFTER
I
WENT
UP
AGAIN
TO
JERUSALEM
WITH
BARNABAS
AND
TOOK
TITUS
WITH
ME
ALSO
AND
I
WENT
UP
BY
REVELATION
AND
COMMUNICATED
UNTO
THEM
THAT
GOSPEL
WHICH
I
PREACH
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
BUT
PRIVATELY
TO
THEM
WHICH
WERE
OF
REPUTATION
LEST
BY
ANY
MEANS
I
SHOULD
RUN
OR
HAD
RUN
IN
VAIN
BUT
NEITHER
TITUS
WHO
WAS
WITH
ME
BEING
A
GREEK
WAS
COMPELLED
TO
BE
CIRCUMCISED
AND
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
FALSE
BRETHREN
UNAWARES
BROUGHT
IN
WHO
CAME
IN
PRIVILY
TO
SPY
OUT
OUR
LIBERTY
WHICH
WE
HAVE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
BRING
US
INTO
BONDAGE
TO
WHOM
WE
GAVE
PLACE
BY
SUBJECTION
NO
NOT
FOR
AN
HOUR
THAT
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
GOSPEL
MIGHT
CONTINUE
WITH
YOU
BUT
OF
THESE
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
SOMEWHAT
WHATSOEVER
THEY
WERE
IT
MAKETH
NO
MATTER
TO
ME
GOD
ACCEPTETH
NO
MAN'S
PERSON
FOR
THEY
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
SOMEWHAT
IN
CONFERENCE
ADDED
NOTHING
TO
ME
BUT
CONTRARIWISE
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THAT
THE
GOSPEL
OF
THE
UNCIRCUMCISION
WAS
COMMITTED
UNTO
ME
AS
THE
GOSPEL
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
WAS
UNTO
PETER
FOR
HE
THAT
WROUGHT
EFFECTUALLY
IN
PETER
TO
THE
APOSTLESHIP
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
THE
SAME
WAS
MIGHTY
IN
ME
TOWARD
THE
GENTILES
AND
WHEN
JAMES
CEPHAS
AND
JOHN
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
PILLARS
PERCEIVED
THE
GRACE
THAT
WAS
GIVEN
UNTO
ME
THEY
GAVE
TO
ME
AND
BARNABAS
THE
RIGHT
HANDS
OF
FELLOWSHIP
THAT
WE
SHOULD
GO
UNTO
THE
HEATHEN
AND
THEY
UNTO
THE
CIRCUMCISION
ONLY
THEY
WOULD
THAT
WE
SHOULD
REMEMBER
THE
POOR
THE
SAME
WHICH
I
ALSO
WAS
FORWARD
TO
DO
BUT
WHEN
PETER
WAS
COME
TO
ANTIOCH
I
WITHSTOOD
HIM
TO
THE
FACE
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
TO
BE
BLAMED
FOR
BEFORE
THAT
CERTAIN
CAME
FROM
JAMES
HE
DID
EAT
WITH
THE
GENTILES
BUT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COME
HE
WITHDREW
AND
SEPARATED
HIMSELF
FEARING
THEM
WHICH
WERE
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
AND
THE
OTHER
JEWS
DISSEMBLED
LIKEWISE
WITH
HIM
INSOMUCH
THAT
BARNABAS
ALSO
WAS
CARRIED
AWAY
WITH
THEIR
DISSIMULATION
BUT
WHEN
I
SAW
THAT
THEY
WALKED
NOT
UPRIGHTLY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
GOSPEL
I
SAID
UNTO
PETER
BEFORE
THEM
ALL
IF
THOU
BEING
A
JEW
LIVEST
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
GENTILES
AND
NOT
AS
DO
THE
JEWS
WHY
COMPELLEST
THOU
THE
GENTILES
TO
LIVE
AS
DO
THE
JEWS
WE
WHO
ARE
JEWS
BY
NATURE
AND
NOT
SINNERS
OF
THE
GENTILES
KNOWING
THAT
A
MAN
IS
NOT
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
BUT
BY
THE
FAITH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
EVEN
WE
HAVE
BELIEVED
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
THAT
WE
MIGHT
BE
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
FAITH
OF
CHRIST
AND
NOT
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
FOR
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
SHALL
NO
FLESH
BE
JUSTIFIED
BUT
IF
WHILE
WE
SEEK
TO
BE
JUSTIFIED
BY
CHRIST
WE
OURSELVES
ALSO
ARE
FOUND
SINNERS
IS
THEREFORE
CHRIST
THE
MINISTER
OF
SIN
GOD
FORBID
FOR
IF
I
BUILD
AGAIN
THE
THINGS
WHICH
I
DESTROYED
I
MAKE
MYSELF
A
TRANSGRESSOR
FOR
I
THROUGH
THE
LAW
AM
DEAD
TO
THE
LAW
THAT
I
MIGHT
LIVE
UNTO
GOD
I
AM
CRUCIFIED
WITH
CHRIST
NEVERTHLESS
I
LIVE
YET
NOT
I
BUT
CHRIST
LIVETH
IN
ME
AND
THE
LIFE
WHICH
I
NOW
LIVE
IN
THE
FLESH
I
LIVE
BY
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
SON
OF
GOD
WHO
LOVED
ME
AND
GAVE
HIMSELF
FOR
ME
I
DO
NOT
FRUSTRATE
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
FOR
IF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
COME
BY
THE
LAW
THEN
CHRIST
IS
DEAD
IN
VAIN
O
FOOLISH
GALATIANS
WHO
HATH
BEWITCHED
YOU
THAT
YE
SHOULD
NOT
OBEY
THE
TRUTH
BEFORE
WHOSE
EYES
JESUS
CHRIST
HATH
BEEN
EVIDENTLY
SET
FORTH
CRUCIFIED
AMONG
YOU
THIS
ONLY
WOULD
I
LEARN
OF
YOU
RECEIVED
YE
THE
SPIRIT
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
OR
BY
THE
HEARING
OF
FAITH
ARE
YE
SO
FOOLISH
HAVING
BEGUN
IN
THE
SPIRIT
ARE
YE
NOW
MADE
PERFECT
BY
THE
FLESH
HAVE
YE
SUFFERED
SO
MANY
THINGS
IN
VAIN
IF
IT
BE
YET
IN
VAIN
HE
THEREFORE
THAT
MINISTERETH
TO
YOU
THE
SPIRIT
AND
WORKETH
MIRACLES
AMONG
YOU
DOETH
HE
IT
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
OR
BY
THE
HEARING
OF
FAITH
EVEN
AS
ABRAHAM
BELIEVED
GOD
AND
IT
WAS
ACCOUNTED
TO
HIM
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
KNOW
YE
THEREFORE
THAT
THEY
WHICH
ARE
OF
FAITH
THE
SAME
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ABRAHAM
AND
THE
SCRIPTURE
FORESEEING
THAT
GOD
WOULD
JUSTIFY
THE
HEATHEN
THROUGH
FAITH
PREACHED
BEFORE
THE
GOSPEL
UNTO
ABRAHAM
SAYING
IN
THEE
SHALL
ALL
NATIONS
BE
BLESSED
SO
THEN
THEY
WHICH
BE
OF
FAITH
ARE
BLESSED
WITH
FAITHFUL
ABRAHAM
FOR
AS
MANY
AS
ARE
OF
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
ARE
UNDER
THE
CURSE
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
CURSED
IS
EVERY
ONE
THAT
CONTINUETH
NOT
IN
ALL
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
THE
LAW
TO
DO
THEM
BUT
THAT
NO
MAN
IS
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
LAW
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
GOD
IT
IS
EVIDENT
FOR
THE
JUST
SHALL
LIVE
BY
FAITH
AND
THE
LAW
IS
NOT
OF
FAITH
BUT
THE
MAN
THAT
DOETH
THEM
SHALL
LIVE
IN
THEM
CHRIST
HATH
REDEEMED
US
FROM
THE
CURSE
OF
THE
LAW
BEING
MADE
A
CURSE
FOR
US
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
CURSED
IS
EVERY
ONE
THAT
HANGETH
ON
A
TREE
THAT
THE
BLESSING
OF
ABRAHAM
MIGHT
COME
ON
THE
GENTILES
THROUGH
JESUS
CHRIST
THAT
WE
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE
PROMISE
OF
THE
SPIRIT
THROUGH
FAITH
BRETHREN
I
SPEAK
AFTER
THE
MANNER
OF
MEN
THOUGH
IT
BE
BUT
A
MAN'S
COVENANT
YET
IF
IT
BE
CONFIRMED
NO
MAN
DISANNULLETH
OR
ADDETH
THERETO
NOW
TO
ABRAHAM
AND
HIS
SEED
WERE
THE
PROMISES
MADE
HE
SAITH
NOT
AND
TO
SEEDS
AS
OF
MANY
BUT
AS
OF
ONE
AND
TO
THY
SEED
WHICH
IS
CHRIST
AND
THIS
I
SAY
THAT
THE
COVENANT
THAT
WAS
CONFIRMED
BEFORE
OF
GOD
IN
CHRIST
THE
LAW
WHICH
WAS
FOUR
HUNDRED
AND
THIRTY
YEARS
AFTER
CANNOT
DISANNUL
THAT
IT
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
PROMISE
OF
NONE
EFFECT
FOR
IF
THE
INHERITANCE
BE
OF
THE
LAW
IT
IS
NO
MORE
OF
PROMISE
BUT
GOD
GAVE
IT
TO
ABRAHAM
BY
PROMISE
WHEREFORE
THEN
SERVETH
THE
LAW
IT
WAS
ADDED
BECAUSE
OF
TRANSGRESSIONS
TILL
THE
SEED
SHOULD
COME
TO
WHOM
THE
PROMISE
WAS
MADE
AND
IT
WAS
ORDAINED
BY
ANGELS
IN
THE
HAND
OF
A
MEDIATOR
NOW
A
MEDIATOR
IS
NOT
A
MEDIATOR
OF
ONE
BUT
GOD
IS
ONE
IS
THE
LAW
THEN
AGAINST
THE
PROMISES
OF
GOD
GOD
FORBID
FOR
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
LAW
GIVEN
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
GIVEN
LIFE
VERILY
RIGHTEOUSNESS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BY
THE
LAW
BUT
THE
SCRIPTURE
HATH
CONCLUDED
ALL
UNDER
SIN
THAT
THE
PROMISE
BY
FAITH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
MIGHT
BE
GIVEN
TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
BUT
BEFORE
FAITH
CAME
WE
WERE
KEPT
UNDER
THE
LAW
SHUT
UP
UNTO
THE
FAITH
WHICH
SHOULD
AFTERWARDS
BE
REVEALED
WHEREFORE
THE
LAW
WAS
OUR
SCHOOLMASTER
TO
BRING
US
UNTO
CHRIST
THAT
WE
MIGHT
BE
JUSTIFIED
BY
FAITH
BUT
AFTER
THAT
FAITH
IS
COME
WE
ARE
NO
LONGER
UNDER
A
SCHOOLMASTER
FOR
YE
ARE
ALL
THE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
BY
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
FOR
AS
MANY
OF
YOU
AS
HAVE
BEEN
BAPTIZED
INTO
CHRIST
HAVE
PUT
ON
CHRIST
THERE
IS
NEITHER
JEW
NOR
GREEK
THERE
IS
NEITHER
BOND
NOR
FREE
THERE
IS
NEITHER
MALE
NOR
FEMALE
FOR
YE
ARE
ALL
ONE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
AND
IF
YE
BE
CHRIST'S
THEN
ARE
YE
ABRAHAM'S
SEED
AND
HEIRS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PROMISE
NOW
I
SAY
THAT
THE
HEIR
AS
LONG
AS
HE
IS
A
CHILD
DIFFERETH
NOTHING
FROM
A
SERVANT
THOUGH
HE
BE
LORD
OF
ALL
BUT
IS
UNDER
TUTORS
AND
GOVERNORS
UNTIL
THE
TIME
APPOINTED
OF
THE
FATHER
EVEN
SO
WE
WHEN
WE
WERE
CHILDREN
WERE
IN
BONDAGE
UNDER
THE
ELEMENTS
OF
THE
WORLD
BUT
WHEN
THE
FULNESS
OF
THE
TIME
WAS
COME
GOD
SENT
FORTH
HIS
SON
MADE
OF
A
WOMAN
MADE
UNDER
THE
LAW
TO
REDEEM
THEM
THAT
WERE
UNDER
THE
LAW
THAT
WE
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE
ADOPTION
OF
SONS
AND
BECAUSE
YE
ARE
SONS
GOD
HATH
SENT
FORTH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
HIS
SON
INTO
YOUR
HEARTS
CRYING
ABBA
FATHER
WHEREFORE
THOU
ART
NO
MORE
A
SERVANT
BUT
A
SON
AND
IF
A
SON
THEN
AN
HEIR
OF
GOD
THROUGH
CHRIST
HOWBEIT
THEN
WHEN
YE
KNEW
NOT
GOD
YE
DID
SERVICE
UNTO
THEM
WHICH
BY
NATURE
ARE
NO
GODS
BUT
NOW
AFTER
THAT
YE
HAVE
KNOWN
GOD
OR
RATHER
ARE
KNOWN
OF
GOD
HOW
TURN
YE
AGAIN
TO
THE
WEAK
AND
BEGGARLY
ELEMENTS
WHEREUNTO
YE
DESIRE
AGAIN
TO
BE
IN
BONDAGE
YE
OBSERVE
DAYS
AND
MONTHS
AND
TIMES
AND
YEARS
I
AM
AFRAID
OF
YOU
LEST
I
HAVE
BESTOWED
UPON
YOU
LABOUR
IN
VAIN
BRETHREN
I
BESEECH
YOU
BE
AS
I
AM
FOR
I
AM
AS
YE
ARE
YE
HAVE
NOT
INJURED
ME
AT
ALL
YE
KNOW
HOW
THROUGH
INFIRMITY
OF
THE
FLESH
I
PREACHED
THE
GOSPEL
UNTO
YOU
AT
THE
FIRST
AND
MY
TEMPTATION
WHICH
WAS
IN
MY
FLESH
YE
DESPISED
NOT
NOR
REJECTED
BUT
RECEIVED
ME
AS
AN
ANGEL
OF
GOD
EVEN
AS
CHRIST
JESUS
WHERE
IS
THEN
THE
BLESSEDNESS
YE
SPAKE
OF
FOR
I
BEAR
YOU
RECORD
THAT
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
POSSIBLE
YE
WOULD
HAVE
PLUCKED
OUT
YOUR
OWN
EYES
AND
HAVE
GIVEN
THEM
TO
ME
AM
I
THEREFORE
BECOME
YOUR
ENEMY
BECAUSE
I
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
THEY
ZEALOUSLY
AFFECT
YOU
BUT
NOT
WELL
YEA
THEY
WOULD
EXCLUDE
YOU
THAT
YE
MIGHT
AFFECT
THEM
BUT
IT
IS
GOOD
TO
BE
ZEALOUSLY
AFFECTED
ALWAYS
IN
A
GOOD
THING
AND
NOT
ONLY
WHEN
I
AM
PRESENT
WITH
YOU
MY
LITTLE
CHILDREN
OF
WHOM
I
TRAVAIL
IN
BIRTH
AGAIN
UNTIL
CHRIST
BE
FORMED
IN
YOU
I
DESIRE
TO
BE
PRESENT
WITH
YOU
NOW
AND
TO
CHANGE
MY
VOICE
FOR
I
STAND
IN
DOUBT
OF
YOU
TELL
ME
YE
THAT
DESIRE
TO
BE
UNDER
THE
LAW
DO
YE
NOT
HEAR
THE
LAW
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THAT
ABRAHAM
HAD
TWO
SONS
THE
ONE
BY
A
BONDMAID
THE
OTHER
BY
A
FREEWOMAN
BUT
HE
WHO
WAS
OF
THE
BONDWOMAN
WAS
BORN
AFTER
THE
FLESH
BUT
HE
OF
THE
FREEWOMAN
WAS
BY
PROMISE
WHICH
THINGS
ARE
AN
ALLEGORY
FOR
THESE
ARE
THE
TWO
COVENANTS
THE
ONE
FROM
THE
MOUNT
SINAI
WHICH
GENDERETH
TO
BONDAGE
WHICH
IS
AGAR
FOR
THIS
AGAR
IS
MOUNT
SINAI
IN
ARABIA
AND
ANSWERETH
TO
JERUSALEM
WHICH
NOW
IS
AND
IS
IN
BONDAGE
WITH
HER
CHILDREN
BUT
JERUSALEM
WHICH
IS
ABOVE
IS
FREE
WHICH
IS
THE
MOTHER
OF
US
ALL
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
REJOICE
THOU
BARREN
THAT
BEAREST
NOT
BREAK
FORTH
AND
CRY
THOU
THAT
TRAVAILEST
NOT
FOR
THE
DESOLATE
HATH
MANY
MORE
CHILDREN
THAN
SHE
WHICH
HATH
AN
HUSBAND
NOW
WE
BRETHREN
AS
ISAAC
WAS
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
PROMISE
BUT
AS
THEN
HE
THAT
WAS
BORN
AFTER
THE
FLESH
PERSECUTED
HIM
THAT
WAS
BORN
AFTER
THE
SPIRIT
EVEN
SO
IT
IS
NOW
NEVERTHELESS
WHAT
SAITH
THE
SCRIPTURE
CAST
OUT
THE
BONDWOMAN
AND
HER
SON
FOR
THE
SON
OF
THE
BONDWOMAN
SHALL
NOT
BE
HEIR
WITH
THE
SON
OF
THE
FREEWOMAN
SO
THEN
BRETHREN
WE
ARE
NOT
CHILDREN
OF
THE
BONDWOMAN
BUT
OF
THE
FREE
STAND
FAST
THEREFORE
IN
THE
LIBERTY
WHEREWITH
CHRIST
HATH
MADE
US
FREE
AND
BE
NOT
ENTANGLED
AGAIN
WITH
THE
YOKE
OF
BONDAGE
BEHOLD
I
PAUL
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
IF
YE
BE
CIRCUMCISED
CHRIST
SHALL
PROFIT
YOU
NOTHING
FOR
I
TESTIFY
AGAIN
TO
EVERY
MAN
THAT
IS
CIRCUMCISED
THAT
HE
IS
A
DEBTOR
TO
DO
THE
WHOLE
LAW
CHRIST
IS
BECOME
OF
NO
EFFECT
UNTO
YOU
WHOSOEVER
OF
YOU
ARE
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
LAW
YE
ARE
FALLEN
FROM
GRACE
FOR
WE
THROUGH
THE
SPIRIT
WAIT
FOR
THE
HOPE
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BY
FAITH
FOR
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
NEITHER
CIRCUMCISION
AVAILETH
ANY
THING
NOR
UNCIRCUMCISION
BUT
FAITH
WHICH
WORKETH
BY
LOVE
YE
DID
RUN
WELL
WHO
DID
HINDER
YOU
THAT
YE
SHOULD
NOT
OBEY
THE
TRUTH
THIS
PERSUASION
COMETH
NOT
OF
HIM
THAT
CALLETH
YOU
A
LITTLE
LEAVEN
LEAVENETH
THE
WHOLE
LUMP
I
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
YOU
THROUGH
THE
LORD
THAT
YE
WILL
BE
NONE
OTHERWISE
MINDED
BUT
HE
THAT
TROUBLETH
YOU
SHALL
BEAR
HIS
JUDGMENT
WHOSOEVER
HE
BE
AND
I
BRETHREN
IF
I
YET
PREACH
CIRCUMCISION
WHY
DO
I
YET
SUFFER
PERSECUTION
THEN
IS
THE

WIVES
SUBMIT

AS
UNTO

HE
IS
THE

BE

IN
EVERY

HUSBANDS
LOVE
YOUR

EVEN
AS

ALSO

GAVE
HIMSELF
FOR
IT
THAT
HE
MIGHT
SANCTIFY
AND
CLEANSE
IT
WITH
THE
WASHING
OF
WATER
BY
THE
WORD
THAT
HE
MIGHT
PRESENT
IT
TO
HIMSELF
A
GLORIOUS
CHURCH
NOT

WRINKLE
OR
ANY
SUCH
THING
BUT
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
HOLY
AND
WITHOUT
BLEMISH
SO
OUGHT
MEN
TO
LOVE
THEIR
WIVES
AS
THEIR
OWN
BODIES
HE
THAT
LOVETH
HIS
WIFE
LOVETH
HIMSELF
FOR
NO
MAN
EVER
YET
HATED
HIS

FLESH
BUT
NOURISHETH
AND
CHERISHETH
IT
EVEN
AS
THE
LORD
THE
CHURCH
FOR
WE
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
HIS
BODY
OF
HIS

AND
OF
HIS

FOR
THIS
CAUSE
SHALL
A
MAN
LEAVE
HIS

MOTHER
AND
SHALL
BE

UNTO
HIS

AND
THEY

THIS
I
PRAY
THAT
YOUR

AND
IN
ALL
JUDGMENT
THAT
YE
MAY
APPROVE
THINGS
THAT

WHICH
ARE
BY
JESUS

UNTO
THE
GLORY

BUT
I
WOULD
YE
SHOULD
UNDERSTAND
BRETHREN
THAT
THE
THINGS
WHICH
HAPPENED
UNTO
ME
HAVE
FALLEN
OUT
RATHER
UNTO
THE
FURTHERANCE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
SO
THAT
MY
BONDS
IN
CHRIST
ARE
MANIFEST
IN
ALL
THE
PALACE
AND
IN
ALL
OTHER
PLACES
AND
MANY
OF
THE
BRETHREN
IN
THE
LORD
WAXING
CONFIDENT
BY
MY
BONDS
ARE
MUCH
MORE
BOLD
TO
SPEAK
THE
WORD
WITHOUT
FEAR
SOME
INDEED
PREACH
CHRIST
EVEN
OF
ENVY
AND
STRIFE
AND
SOME
ALSO
OF
GOOD
WILL
THE
ONE
PREACH
CHRIST
OF
CONTENTION
NOT
SINCERELY
SUPPOSING
TO
ADD
AFFLICTION
TO
MY
BONDS
BUT
THE
OTHER
OF
LOVE
KNOWING
THAT
I
AM
SET
FOR
THE
DEFENCE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
WHAT
THEN
NOTWITHSTANDING
EVERY
WAY
WHETHER
IN
PRETENCE
OR
IN
TRUTH
CHRIST
IS
PREACHED
AND
I
THEREIN
DO
REJOICE
YEA
AND
WILL
REJOICE
FOR
I
KNOW
THAT
THIS
SHALL
TURN
TO
MY
SALVATION
THROUGH
YOUR
PRAYER
AND
THE
SUPPLY
OF
THE
SPIRIT
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
ACCORDING
TO
MY
EARNEST
EXPECTATION
AND
MY
HOPE
THAT
IN
NOTHING
I
SHALL
BE
ASHAMED
BUT
THAT
WITH
ALL
BOLDNESS
AS
ALWAYS
SO
NOW
ALSO
CHRIST
SHALL
BE
MAGNIFIED
IN
MY
BODY
WHETHER
IT
BE
BY
LIFE
OR
BY
DEATH
FOR
TO
ME
TO
LIVE
IS
CHRIST
AND
TO
DIE
IS
GAIN
BUT
IF
I
LIVE
IN
THE
FLESH
THIS
IS
THE
FRUIT
OF
MY
LABOUR
YET
WHAT
I
SHALL
CHOOSE
I
WOT
NOT
FOR
I
AM
IN
A
STRAIT
BETWIXT
TWO
HAVING
A
DESIRE
TO
DEPART
AND
TO
BE
WITH
CHRIST
WHICH
IS
FAR
BETTER
NEVERTHELESS
TO
ABIDE
IN
THE
FLESH
IS
MORE
NEEDFUL
FOR
YOU
AND
HAVING
THIS
CONFIDENCE
I
KNOW
THAT
I
SHALL
ABIDE
AND
CONTINUE
WITH
YOU
ALL
FOR
YOUR
FURTHERANCE
AND
JOY
OF
FAITH
THAT
YOUR
REJOICING
MAY
BE
MORE
ABUNDANT
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
FOR
ME
BY
MY
COMING
TO
YOU
AGAIN
ONLY
LET
YOUR
CONVERSATION
BE
AS
IT
BECOMETH
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
THAT
WHETHER
I
COME
AND
SEE
YOU
OR
ELSE
BE
ABSENT
I
MAY
HEAR
OF
YOUR
AFFAIRS
THAT
YE
STAND
FAST
IN
ONE
SPIRIT
WITH
ONE
MIND
STRIVING
TOGETHER
FOR
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
GOSPEL
AND
IN
NOTHING
TERRIFIED
BY
YOUR
ADVERSARIES
WHICH
IS
TO
THEM
AN
EVIDENT
TOKEN
OF
PERDITION
BUT
TO
YOU
OF
SALVATION
AND
THAT
OF
GOD
FOR
UNTO
YOU
IT
IS
GIVEN
IN
THE
BEHALF
OF
CHRIST
NOT
ONLY
TO
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
BUT
ALSO
TO
SUFFER
FOR
HIS
SAKE
HAVING
THE
SAME
CONFLICT
WHICH
YE
SAW
IN
ME
AND
NOW
HEAR
TO
BE
IN
ME
IF
THERE
BE
THEREFORE
ANY
CONSOLATION
IN
CHRIST
IF
ANY
COMFORT
OF
LOVE
IF
ANY
FELLOWSHIP
OF
THE

IF
ANY
BOWELS
AND
MERCIES
FULFIL
YE
MY
JOY
THAT
YE
BE
LIKEMINDED
HAVING
THE
SAME
LOVE
BEING
OF
ONE
ACCORD
OF
ONE
MIND
LET
NOTHING
BE
DONE
THROUGH
STRIFE
OR
VAINGLORY
BUT
IN
LOWLINESS
OF
MIND
LET
EACH
ESTEEM
OTHER
BETTER
THAN
THEMSELVES
LOOK
NOT
EVERY
MAN
ON
HIS
OWN
THINGS
BUT
EVERY
MAN
ALSO
ON
THE
THINGS
OF
OTHERS
LET
THIS
MIND
BE
IN
YOU
WHICH
WAS
ALSO
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
WHO
BEING
IN
THE
FORM
OF
GOD
THOUGHT
IT
NOT
ROBBERY
TO
BE
EQUAL
WITH
GOD
BUT
MADE
HIMSELF
OF
NO
REPUTATION
AND
TOOK
UPON
HIM
THE
FORM
OF
A
SERVANT
AND
WAS
MADE
IN
THE
LIKENESS
OF
MEN
AND
BEING
FOUND
IN
FASHION
AS
A
MAN
HE
HUMBLED
HIMSELF
AND
BECAME
OBEDIENT
UNTO
DEATH
EVEN
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
CROSS
WHEREFORE
GOD
ALSO
HATH
HIGHLY
EXALTED
HIM
AND
GIVEN
HIM
A
NAME
WHICH
IS
ABOVE
EVERY
NAME
THAT
AT
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
EVERY
KNEE
SHOULD
BOW
OF
THINGS
IN
HEAVEN
AND
THINGS
IN
EARTH
AND
THINGS
UNDER
THE
EARTH
AND
THAT
EVERY
TONGUE
SHOULD
CONFESS
THAT
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
LORD
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
THE
FATHER
WHEREFORE
MY
BELOVED
AS
YE
HAVE
ALWAYS
OBEYED
NOT
AS
IN
MY
PRESENCE
ONLY
BUT
NOW
MUCH
MORE
IN
MY
ABSENCE
WORK
OUT
YOUR
OWN
SALVATION
WITH
FEAR
AND
TREMBLING
FOR
IT
IS
GOD
WHICH
WORKETH
IN
YOU
BOTH
TO
WILL
AND
TO
DO
OF
HIS
GOOD
PLEASURE
DO
ALL
THINGS
WITHOUT
MURMURINGS
AND
DISPUTINGS
THAT
YE
MAY
BE
BLAMELESS
AND
HARMLESS
THE
SONS
OF
GOD
WITHOUT
REBUKE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
A
CROOKED
AND
PERVERSE
NATION
AMONG
WHOM
YE
SHINE
AS
LIGHTS
IN
THE
WORLD
HOLDING
FORTH
THE
WORD
OF
LIFE
THAT
I
MAY
REJOICE
IN
THE
DAY
OF
CHRIST
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
RUN
IN
VAIN
NEITHER
LABOURED
IN
VAIN
YEA
AND
IF
I
BE
OFFERED
UPON
THE
SACRIFICE
AND
SERVICE
OF
YOUR
FAITH
I
JOY
AND
REJOICE
WITH
YOU
ALL
FOR
THE
SAME
CAUSE
ALSO
DO
YE
JOY
AND
REJOICE
WITH
ME
BUT
I
TRUST
IN
THE
LORD
JESUS
TO
SEND
TIMOTHEUS
SHORTLY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
I
ALSO
MAY
BE
OF
GOOD
COMFORT
WHEN
I
KNOW
YOUR
STATE
FOR
I
HAVE
NO
MAN
LIKEMINDED
WHO
WILL
NATURALLY
CARE
FOR
YOUR
STATE
FOR
ALL
SEEK
THEIR
OWN
NOT
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
JESUS
CHRIST'S
BUT
YE
KNOW
THE
PROOF
OF
HIM
THAT
AS
A
SON
WITH
THE
FATHER
HE
HATH
SERVED
WITH
ME
IN
THE
GOSPEL
HIM
THEREFORE
I
HOPE
TO
SEND
PRESENTLY
SO
SOON
AS
I
SHALL
SEE
HOW
IT
WILL
GO
WITH
ME
BUT
I
TRUST
IN
THE
LORD
THAT
I
ALSO
MYSELF
SHALL
COME
SHORTLY
YET
I
SUPPOSED
IT
NECESSARY
TO
SEND
TO
YOU
EPAPHRODITUS
MY
BROTHER
AND
COMPANION
IN
LABOUR
AND
FELLOWSOLDIER
BUT
YOUR
MESSENGER
AND
HE
THAT
MINISTERED
TO
MY
WANTS
FOR
HE
LONGED
AFTER
YOU
ALL
AND
WAS
FULL
OF
HEAVINESS
BECAUSE
THAT
YE
HAD
HEARD
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
SICK
FOR
INDEED
HE
WAS
SICK
NIGH
UNTO
DEATH
BUT
GOD
HAD
MERCY
ON
HIM
AND
NOT
ON
HIM
ONLY
BUT
ON
ME
ALSO
LEST
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SORROW
UPON
SORROW
I
SENT
HIM
THEREFORE
THE
MORE
CAREFULLY
THAT
WHEN
YE
SEE
HIM
AGAIN
YE
MAY
REJOICE
AND
THAT
I
MAY
BE
THE
LESS
SORROWFUL
RECEIVE
HIM
THEREFORE
IN
THE
LORD
WITH
ALL
GLADNESS
AND
HOLD
SUCH
IN
REPUTATION
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
WORK
OF
CHRIST
HE
WAS
NIGH
UNTO
DEATH
NOT
REGARDING
HIS
LIFE
TO
SUPPLY
YOUR
LACK
OF
SERVICE
TOWARD
ME
FINALLY
MY
BRETHREN
REJOICE
IN
THE
LORD
TO
WRITE
THE
SAME
THINGS
TO
YOU
TO
ME
INDEED
IS
NOT
GRIEVOUS
BUT
FOR
YOU
IT
IS
SAFE
BEWARE
OF
DOGS
BEWARE
OF
EVIL
WORKERS
BEWARE
OF
THE
CONCISION
FOR
WE
ARE
THE
CIRCUMCISION
WHICH
WORSHIP
GOD
IN
THE
SPIRIT
AND
REJOICE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
AND
HAVE
NO
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE

THOUGH
I
MIGHT
ALSO
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE

IF
ANY
OTHER
MAN
THINKETH
THAT

HATH
WHEREOF

THOSE
I
COUNTED
LOSS
FOR

FOR

I
HAVE
SUFFERED
THE

I
MAY
WIN
CHRIST
AND
BE
FOUND
IN
HIM
NOT
HAVING
MINE

RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHICH
IS
OF

THAT
YE
KNEW

CONFLICT
I
HAVE
FOR

AT

AND
FOR
AS

THAT
THEIR

MIGHT
BE

BEING
KNIT

IN

ALL
THE
TREASURES
OF

AND
THIS
I

LEST
ANY

SHOULD
BEGUILE
YOU
WITH

AND
THE
STEDFASTNESS
OF
YOUR

SO
WALK

ROOTED

BUILT
UP
IN

AND
STABLISHED
IN
THE
FAITH
AS
YE
HAVE
BEEN
TAUGHT
ABOUNDING
THEREIN
WITH
THANKSGIVING
BEWARE
LEST
ANY
MAN
SPOIL
YOU
THROUGH
PHILOSOPHY
AND
VAIN
DECEIT
AFTER
THE
TRADITION
OF
MEN
AFTER
THE
RUDIMENTS
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
NOT
AFTER
CHRIST
FOR
IN
HIM
DWELLETH
ALL
THE
FULNESS
OF
THE
GODHEAD
BODILY

AND
YE
ARE
COMPLETE
IN
HIM
WHICH
IS
THE
HEAD
OF
ALL
PRINCIPALITY
AND
POWER

IN
WHOM
ALSO
YE
ARE
CIRCUMCISED
WITH
THE
CIRCUMCISION
MADE
WITHOUT
HANDS
IN
PUTTING
OFF
THE
BODY
OF
THE
SINS
OF
THE
FLESH
BY
THE
CIRCUMCISION
OF
CHRIST

BURIED
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
WHEREIN
ALSO
YE
ARE
RISEN
WITH
HIM
THROUGH
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
OPERATION
OF
GOD
WHO
HATH
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD

AND
YOU
BEING
DEAD
IN
YOUR
SINS
AND
THE
UNCIRCUMCISION
OF
YOUR
FLESH
HATH
HE
QUICKENED
TOGETHER
WITH
HIM
HAVING
FORGIVEN
YOU
ALL
TRESPASSES

BLOTTING
OUT
THE
HANDWRITING
OF
ORDINANCES
THAT
WAS
AGAINST
US
WHICH
WAS
CONTRARY
TO
US
AND
TOOK
IT
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
NAILING
IT
TO
HIS
CROSS

AND
HAVING
SPOILED
PRINCIPALITIES
AND
POWERS
HE
MADE
A
SHEW
OF
THEM
OPENLY
TRIUMPHING
OVER
THEM
IN
IT

LET
NO
MAN
THEREFORE
JUDGE
YOU
IN
MEAT
OR
IN

OR
IN
RESPECT
OF
AN
HOLYDAY
OR
OF
THE
NEW
MOON
OR
OF
THE
SABBATH
DAYS

WHICH
ARE
A
SHADOW
OF

TO
COME
BUT
THE

LET
NO
MAN
BEGUILE
YOU
OF
YOUR
REWARD
IN
A
VOLUNTARY
HUMILITY
AND
WORSHIPPING
OF
ANGELS
INTRUDING
INTO
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
HE
HATH
NOT

PUFFED
UP
BY

AND
NOT
HOLDING
THE

FROM
WHICH
ALL
THE
BODY
BY
JOINTS
AND
BANDS
HAVING
NOURISHMENT
MINISTERED
AND
KNIT
TOGETHER
INCREASETH
WITH
THE
INCREASE
OF
GOD

WHEREFORE
IF
YE
BE
DEAD
WITH
CHRIST
FROM
THE
RUDIMENTS
OF
THE
WORLD
WHY
AS
THOUGH
LIVING
IN
THE
WORLD
ARE
YE
SUBJECT
TO
ORDINANCES

TOUCH
NOT
TASTE
NOT
HANDLE
NOT

WHICH
ALL
ARE
TO
PERISH
WITH
THE

WHICH

HAVE
INDEED
A

OF
THE

NOT

THOSE

SITTETH
ON

AS

TO
BE
PUT
IN

WITH
THE

EVEN
SO
WE
SPEAK
NOT
AS
PLEASING
MEN

GOD
WHICH
TRIETH
OUR

FOR
NEITHER
AT
ANY
TIME
USED
WE
FLATTERING
WORDS

HAVE
PERSECUTED

OF

FOR
YOURSELVES
KNOW
HOW
YE
OUGHT
TO
FOLLOW
US
FOR
WE
BEHAVED
NOT
OURSELVES
DISORDERLY
AMONG
YOU
NEITHER
DID
WE
EAT
ANY
MAN'S
BREAD
FOR
NOUGHT
BUT
WROUGHT
WITH
LABOUR
AND
TRAVAIL
NIGHT
AND
DAY
THAT
WE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
CHARGEABLE
TO
ANY
OF
YOU
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
NOT
POWER
BUT
TO
MAKE
OURSELVES
AN
ENSAMPLE
UNTO
YOU
TO
FOLLOW
US
FOR
EVEN
WHEN
WE
WERE
WITH
YOU
THIS
WE
COMMANDED
YOU
THAT
IF
ANY
WOULD
NOT
WORK
NEITHER
SHOULD
HE
EAT
FOR
WE
HEAR
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
WHICH
WALK
AMONG
YOU
DISORDERLY
WORKING
NOT
AT
ALL
BUT
ARE
BUSYBODIES
NOW
THEM
THAT
ARE
SUCH
WE
COMMAND
AND
EXHORT
BY
OUR

THAT
WITH
QUIETNESS
THEY
WORK
AND
EAT
THEIR

BUT
YE
BRETHREN
BE
NOT
WEARY
IN
WELL
DOING
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
OBEY
NOT
OUR
WORD
BY
THIS
EPISTLE
NOTE
THAT
MAN
AND
HAVE
NO
COMPANY
WITH
HIM
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
ASHAMED
YET
COUNT
HIM

AN
ENEMY
BUT
ADMONISH
HIM
AS
A

YOU
PEACE
ALWAYS
BY
ALL

ALL
AMEN
PAUL
AN
APOSTLE
OF
JESUS

BY
THE

OF
GOD
OUR
SAVIOUR
AND
LORD
JESUS

WHICH
IS
OUR
HOPE
UNTO
TIMOTHY
MY
OWN
SON
IN
THE
FAITH
GRACE
MERCY
AND
PEACE
FROM
GOD
OUR
FATHER
AND
JESUS
CHRIST
OUR
LORD
AS
I
BESOUGHT
THEE
TO
ABIDE
STILL
AT
EPHESUS
WHEN
I
WENT
INTO
MACEDONIA
THAT
THOU
MIGHTEST
CHARGE
SOME
THAT
THEY
TEACH
NO
OTHER
DOCTRINE
NEITHER
GIVE
HEED
TO
FABLES
AND
ENDLESS
GENEALOGIES
WHICH
MINISTER
QUESTIONS
RATHER
THAN
GODLY
EDIFYING
WHICH
IS
IN
FAITH
SO
DO
NOW
THE
END
OF
THE
COMMANDMENT
IS
CHARITY
OUT
OF
A
PURE
HEART
AND
OF
A
GOOD
CONSCIENCE
AND
OF
FAITH
UNFEIGNED
FROM
WHICH
SOME
HAVING
SWERVED
HAVE

ASIDE
UNTO
VAIN
JANGLING
DESIRING
TO
BE
TEACHERS
OF
THE
LAW
UNDERSTANDING
NEITHER
WHAT
THEY
SAY
NOR
WHEREOF
THEY
AFFIRM
BUT
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
LAW
IS
GOOD
IF
A
MAN
USE
IT
LAWFULLY
KNOWING
THIS
THAT
THE
LAW
IS
NOT
MADE
FOR
A
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
BUT
FOR
THE
LAWLESS
AND
DISOBEDIENT
FOR
THE
UNGODLY
AND
FOR
SINNERS
FOR
UNHOLY
AND
PROFANE
FOR
MURDERERS
OF
FATHERS
AND
MURDERERS
OF
MOTHERS
FOR
MANSLAYERS
FOR
WHOREMONGERS
FOR
THEM
THAT
DEFILE
THEMSELVES
WITH

FOR
MENSTEALERS
FOR

FOR
PERJURED
PERSONS
AND
IF
THERE

ANY
OTHER
THING
THAT
IS
CONTRARY
TO

ACCORDING
TO
THE

JESUS
OUR

WHO
HATH
ENABLED
ME
FOR
THAT
HE
COUNTED
ME
FAITHFUL
PUTTING
ME
INTO
THE
MINISTRY
WHO
WAS
BEFORE
A
BLASPHEMER
AND
A
PERSECUTOR
AND
INJURIOUS
BUT
I
OBTAINED
MERCY
BECAUSE
I
DID
IT
IGNORANTLY
IN
UNBELIEF
AND
THE
GRACE
OF
OUR

WAS
EXCEEDING
ABUNDANT
WITH
FAITH
AND
LOVE
WHICH
IS
IN

JESUS
THIS
IS
A

CAME
INTO
THE

TO
SAVE
SINNERS
OF
WHOM

HOWBEIT
FOR

ETERNAL
IMMORTAL
INVISIBLE
THE
ONLY
WISE
GOD

FOR

THIS
CHARGE
I
COMMIT
UNTO
THEE
SON
TIMOTHY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PROPHECIES
WHICH
WENT
BEFORE
ON
THEE
THAT
THOU
BY
THEM
MIGHTEST
WAR
A
GOOD
WARFARE
HOLDING
FAITH
AND
A
GOOD
CONSCIENCE
WHICH
SOME
HAVING
PUT
AWAY
CONCERNING

HAVE
MADE
SHIPWRECK
OF
WHOM
IS
HYMENAEUS
AND
ALEXANDER
WHOM
I
HAVE
DELIVERED
UNTO
SATAN
THAT
THEY
MAY
LEARN
NOT

I
EXHORT
THEREFORE
THAT

THAT
WE
MAY
LEAD
A

LIFE
IN

FOR
THIS
IS
GOOD

IN
THE

OUR
SAVIOUR
WHO
WILL
HAVE
ALL
MEN
TO
BE
SAVED
AND
TO
COME
UNTO
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE

FOR
THERE
IS

WHO
GAVE
HIMSELF
A

WHEREUNTO
I
AM
ORDAINED
A

FROM

THEREFORE
TO

LEST
ANY

FALL
AFTER
THE

FOR
THE

NEITHER

ARE
NAKED
AND
OPENED
UNTO
THE
EYES
OF
HIM
WITH
WHOM
WE
HAVE
TO

SEEING
THEN
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
GREAT
HIGH
PRIEST
THAT
IS
PASSED
INTO
THE
HEAVENS
JESUS
THE
SON
OF
GOD
LET
US
HOLD
FAST
OUR
PROFESSION
FOR
WE
HAVE
NOT
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
TOUCHED
WITH
THE
FEELING
OF
OUR
INFIRMITIES
BUT
WAS
IN
ALL
POINTS
TEMPTED
LIKE
AS
WE
ARE
YET
WITHOUT

LET
US
THEREFORE
COME
BOLDLY
UNTO
THE
THRONE
OF
GRACE
THAT
WE
MAY
OBTAIN
MERCY
AND
FIND
GRACE
TO
HELP
IN

OF

TAKEN
FROM
AMONG

IS
ORDAINED
FOR
MEN
IN
THINGS
PERTAINING
TO
GOD
THAT
HE
MAY
OFFER
BOTH
GIFTS
AND
SACRIFICES
FOR
SINS
WHO
CAN
HAVE
COMPASSION
ON
THE
IGNORANT
AND
ON
THEM
THAT
ARE
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
FOR
THAT
HE
HIMSELF
ALSO
IS
COMPASSED
WITH
INFIRMITY
AND
BY
REASON
HEREOF
HE
OUGHT
AS
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
SO
ALSO
FOR
HIMSELF
TO
OFFER
FOR
SINS
AND
NO
MAN
TAKETH
THIS
HONOUR
UNTO
HIMSELF
BUT
HE
THAT
IS
CALLED
OF
GOD
AS
WAS
AARON
SO
ALSO
CHRIST
GLORIFIED
NOT
HIMSELF
TO
BE
MADE
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
BUT
HE
THAT
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THOU
ART
MY
SON
TO
DAY
HAVE
I
BEGOTTEN
THEE
AS
HE
SAITH
ALSO
IN
ANOTHER
PLACE
THOU
ART
A
PRIEST
FOR
EVER
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
WHO
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
FLESH
WHEN
HE
HAD
OFFERED
UP
PRAYERS
AND
SUPPLICATIONS
WITH
STRONG
CRYING
AND
TEARS
UNTO
HIM
THAT
WAS
ABLE
TO
SAVE
HIM
FROM
DEATH
AND
WAS
HEARD
IN
THAT
HE
FEARED
THOUGH
HE
WERE
A
SON
YET
LEARNED
HE
OBEDIENCE
BY
THE
THINGS
WHICH
HE
SUFFERED
AND
BEING
MADE
PERFECT
HE
BECAME
THE
AUTHOR
OF
ETERNAL
SALVATION
UNTO
ALL
THEM
THAT
OBEY
HIM
CALLED
OF
GOD
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
OF
WHOM
WE
HAVE
MANY
THINGS
TO
SAY
AND
HARD
TO
BE
UTTERED
SEEING
YE
ARE
DULL
OF
HEARING
FOR
WHEN
FOR
THE
TIME
YE
OUGHT
TO
BE
TEACHERS
YE
HAVE
NEED
THAT
ONE
TEACH
YOU
AGAIN
WHICH
BE
THE
FIRST
PRINCIPLES
OF
THE
ORACLES
OF
GOD
AND
ARE
BECOME
SUCH
AS
HAVE
NEED
OF
MILK
AND
NOT
OF
STRONG
MEAT
FOR
EVERY
ONE
THAT
USETH
MILK
IS
UNSKILFUL
IN
THE
WORD
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
FOR
HE
IS
A
BABE
BUT
STRONG
MEAT
BELONGETH
TO
THEM
THAT
ARE
OF
FULL
AGE
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
BY
REASON
OF
USE
HAVE
THEIR
SENSES
EXERCISED
TO
DISCERN
BOTH
GOOD
AND
EVIL
THEREFORE
LEAVING
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
CHRIST
LET
US
GO
ON
UNTO
PERFECTION
NOT
LAYING
AGAIN
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
REPENTANCE
FROM
DEAD
WORKS
AND
OF
FAITH
TOWARD
GOD
OF
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
BAPTISMS
AND
OF
LAYING
ON
OF
HANDS
AND
OF
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
AND
OF
ETERNAL
JUDGMENT
AND
THIS
WILL
WE
DO
IF
GOD
PERMIT
FOR
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WERE
ONCE
ENLIGHTENED
AND
HAVE
TASTED
OF
THE
HEAVENLY
GIFT
AND
WERE
MADE
PARTAKERS
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
AND
HAVE
TASTED
THE
GOOD
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
THE
POWERS
OF
THE
WORLD
TO
COME
IF
THEY
SHALL
FALL
AWAY
TO
RENEW
THEM
AGAIN
UNTO
REPENTANCE
SEEING
THEY
CRUCIFY
TO
THEMSELVES
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AFRESH
AND
PUT
HIM
TO
AN
OPEN
SHAME
FOR
THE
EARTH
WHICH
DRINKETH
IN
THE
RAIN
THAT
COMETH
OFT
UPON
IT
AND
BRINGETH
FORTH
HERBS
MEET
FOR
THEM
BY
WHOM
IT
IS
DRESSED
RECEIVETH
BLESSING
FROM
GOD
BUT
THAT
WHICH
BEARETH
THORNS
AND
BRIERS
IS
REJECTED
AND
IS
NIGH
UNTO
CURSING
WHOSE
END
IS
TO
BE
BURNED
BUT
BELOVED
WE
ARE
PERSUADED
BETTER
THINGS
OF
YOU
AND
THINGS
THAT
ACCOMPANY
SALVATION
THOUGH
WE
THUS
SPEAK
FOR
GOD
IS
NOT
UNRIGHTEOUS
TO
FORGET
YOUR
WORK
AND
LABOUR
OF
LOVE
WHICH
YE
HAVE
SHEWED
TOWARD
HIS
NAME
IN
THAT
YE
HAVE
MINISTERED
TO
THE
SAINTS
AND
DO
MINISTER
AND
WE
DESIRE
THAT
EVERY
ONE
OF
YOU
DO
SHEW
THE
SAME
DILIGENCE
TO
THE
FULL
ASSURANCE
OF
HOPE
UNTO
THE
END
THAT
YE
BE
NOT
SLOTHFUL
BUT
FOLLOWERS
OF
THEM
WHO
THROUGH
FAITH
AND
PATIENCE
INHERIT
THE
PROMISES
FOR
WHEN
GOD
MADE
PROMISE
TO
ABRAHAM
BECAUSE
HE
COULD
SWEAR
BY
NO
GREATER
HE
SWARE
BY
HIMSELF
SAYING
SURELY
BLESSING
I
WILL
BLESS
THEE
AND
MULTIPLYING
I
WILL
MULTIPLY
THEE
AND
SO
AFTER
HE
HAD
PATIENTLY
ENDURED
HE
OBTAINED
THE
PROMISE
FOR
MEN
VERILY
SWEAR
BY
THE
GREATER
AND
AN
OATH
FOR
CONFIRMATION
IS
TO
THEM
AN
END
OF
ALL
STRIFE
WHEREIN
GOD
WILLING
MORE
ABUNDANTLY
TO
SHEW
UNTO
THE
HEIRS
OF
PROMISE
THE
IMMUTABILITY
OF
HIS
COUNSEL
CONFIRMED
IT
BY
AN
OATH
THAT
BY
TWO
IMMUTABLE
THINGS
IN
WHICH
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
GOD
TO
LIE
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
STRONG
CONSOLATION
WHO
HAVE
FLED
FOR
REFUGE
TO
LAY
HOLD
UPON
THE
HOPE
SET
BEFORE
US
WHICH
HOPE
WE
HAVE
AS
AN
ANCHOR
OF
THE
SOUL
BOTH
SURE
AND
STEDFAST
AND
WHICH
ENTERETH
INTO
THAT
WITHIN
THE
VEIL
WHITHER
THE
FORERUNNER
IS
FOR
US
ENTERED
EVEN
JESUS
MADE
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
FOR
EVER
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
FOR
THIS
MELCHISEDEC
KING
OF
SALEM
PRIEST
OF
THE
MOST
HIGH
GOD
WHO
MET
ABRAHAM
RETURNING
FROM
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
THE
KINGS
AND
BLESSED
HIM
TO
WHOM
ALSO
ABRAHAM
GAVE
A
TENTH
PART
OF
ALL
FIRST
BEING
BY
INTERPRETATION
KING
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
AFTER
THAT
ALSO
KING
OF
SALEM
WHICH
IS
KING
OF
PEACE
WITHOUT
FATHER
WITHOUT
MOTHER
WITHOUT
DESCENT
HAVING
NEITHER
BEGINNING
OF
DAYS
NOR
END
OF
LIFE
BUT
MADE
LIKE
UNTO
THE
SON
OF
GOD
ABIDETH
A
PRIEST
CONTINUALLY
NOW
CONSIDER
HOW
GREAT
THIS
MAN
WAS
UNTO
WHOM
EVEN
THE
PATRIARCH
ABRAHAM
GAVE
THE
TENTH
OF
THE
SPOILS
AND
VERILY
THEY
THAT
ARE
OF
THE
SONS
OF
LEVI
WHO
RECEIVE
THE
OFFICE
OF
THE
PRIESTHOOD
HAVE
A
COMMANDMENT
TO
TAKE
TITHES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LAW
THAT
IS
OF
THEIR
BRETHREN
THOUGH
THEY
COME
OUT
OF
THE
LOINS
OF
ABRAHAM
BUT
HE
WHOSE
DESCENT
IS
NOT
COUNTED
FROM
THEM
RECEIVED
TITHES
OF
ABRAHAM
AND
BLESSED
HIM
THAT
HAD
THE
PROMISES
AND
WITHOUT
ALL
CONTRADICTION
THE
LESS
IS
BLESSED
OF
THE
BETTER
AND
HERE
MEN
THAT
DIE
RECEIVE
TITHES
BUT
THERE
HE
RECEIVETH
THEM
OF
WHOM
IT
IS
WITNESSED
THAT
HE
LIVETH
AND
AS
I
MAY
SO
SAY
LEVI
ALSO
WHO
RECEIVETH
TITHES
PAYED
TITHES
IN
ABRAHAM
FOR
HE
WAS
YET
IN
THE
LOINS
OF
HIS
FATHER
WHEN
MELCHISEDEC
MET
HIM
IF
THEREFORE
PERFECTION
WERE
BY
THE
LEVITICAL
PRIESTHOOD
FOR
UNDER
IT
THE
PEOPLE
RECEIVED
THE
LAW
WHAT
FURTHER
NEED
WAS
THERE
THAT
ANOTHER
PRIEST
SHOULD
RISE
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
AND
NOT
BE
CALLED
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
AARON
FOR
THE
PRIESTHOOD
BEING
CHANGED
THERE
IS
MADE
OF
NECESSITY
A
CHANGE
ALSO
OF
THE
LAW
FOR
HE
OF
WHOM
THESE
THINGS
ARE
SPOKEN
PERTAINETH
TO
ANOTHER
TRIBE
OF
WHICH
NO
MAN
GAVE
ATTENDANCE
AT
THE
ALTAR
FOR
IT
IS
EVIDENT
THAT
OUR
LORD
SPRANG
OUT
OF
JUDA
OF
WHICH
TRIBE
MOSES
SPAKE
NOTHING
CONCERNING
PRIESTHOOD
AND
IT
IS
YET
FAR
MORE
EVIDENT
FOR
THAT
AFTER
THE
SIMILITUDE
OF
MELCHISEDEC
THERE
ARISETH
ANOTHER
PRIEST
WHO
IS
MADE
NOT
AFTER
THE
LAW
OF
A
CARNAL
COMMANDMENT
BUT
AFTER
THE
POWER
OF
AN
ENDLESS
LIFE
FOR
HE
TESTIFIETH
THOU
ART
A
PRIEST
FOR
EVER
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
FOR
THERE
IS
VERILY
A
DISANNULLING
OF
THE
COMMANDMENT
GOING
BEFORE
FOR
THE
WEAKNESS
AND
UNPROFITABLENESS
THEREOF
FOR
THE
LAW
MADE
NOTHING
PERFECT
BUT
THE
BRINGING
IN
OF
A
BETTER
HOPE
DID
BY
THE
WHICH
WE
DRAW
NIGH
UNTO
GOD
AND
INASMUCH
AS
NOT
WITHOUT
AN
OATH
HE
WAS
MADE
PRIEST
FOR
THOSE
PRIESTS
WERE
MADE
WITHOUT
AN
OATH
BUT
THIS
WITH
AN
OATH
BY
HIM
THAT
SAID
UNTO
HIM
THE
LORD
SWARE
AND
WILL
NOT
REPENT
THOU
ART
A
PRIEST
FOR
EVER
AFTER
THE
ORDER
OF
MELCHISEDEC
BY
SO
MUCH
WAS
JESUS
MADE
A
SURETY
OF
A
BETTER
TESTAMENT
AND
THEY
TRULY
WERE
MANY
PRIESTS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOT
SUFFERED
TO
CONTINUE
BY
REASON
OF
DEATH
BUT
THIS
MAN
BECAUSE
HE
CONTINUETH
EVER
HATH
AN
UNCHANGEABLE
PRIESTHOOD
WHEREFORE
HE
IS
ABLE
ALSO
TO
SAVE
THEM
TO
THE
UTTERMOST
THAT
COME
UNTO
GOD
BY
HIM
SEEING
HE
EVER
LIVETH
TO
MAKE
INTERCESSION
FOR
THEM
FOR
SUCH
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
BECAME
US
WHO
IS
HOLY
HARMLESS
UNDEFILED
SEPARATE
FROM
SINNERS
AND
MADE
HIGHER
THAN
THE
HEAVENS
WHO
NEEDETH
NOT
DAILY
AS
THOSE
HIGH
PRIESTS
TO
OFFER
UP
SACRIFICE
FIRST
FOR
HIS
OWN
SINS
AND
THEN
FOR
THE
PEOPLE'S
FOR
THIS
HE
DID
ONCE
WHEN
HE
OFFERED
UP
HIMSELF
FOR
THE
LAW
MAKETH
MEN
HIGH
PRIESTS
WHICH
HAVE
INFIRMITY
BUT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
OATH
WHICH
WAS
SINCE
THE
LAW
MAKETH
THE
SON
WHO
IS
CONSECRATED
FOR
EVERMORE
NOW
OF
THE
THINGS
WHICH
WE
HAVE
SPOKEN
THIS
IS
THE
SUM
WE
HAVE
SUCH
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
WHO
IS
SET
ON
THE
RIGHT
HAND
OF
THE
THRONE
OF
THE
MAJESTY
IN
THE
HEAVENS
A
MINISTER
OF
THE
SANCTUARY
AND
OF
THE
TRUE
TABERNACLE
WHICH
THE
LORD
PITCHED
AND
NOT
MAN
FOR
EVERY
HIGH
PRIEST
IS
ORDAINED
TO
OFFER
GIFTS
AND
SACRIFICES
WHEREFORE
IT
IS
OF
NECESSITY
THAT
THIS
MAN
HAVE
SOMEWHAT
ALSO
TO
OFFER
FOR
IF
HE
WERE
ON
EARTH
HE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
A
PRIEST
SEEING
THAT
THERE
ARE
PRIESTS
THAT
OFFER
GIFTS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LAW
WHO
SERVE
UNTO
THE
EXAMPLE
AND
SHADOW
OF
HEAVENLY
THINGS
AS
MOSES
WAS
ADMONISHED
OF
GOD
WHEN
HE
WAS
ABOUT
TO
MAKE
THE
TABERNACLE
FOR
SEE
SAITH
HE
THAT
THOU
MAKE
ALL
THINGS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PATTERN
SHEWED
TO
THEE
IN
THE
MOUNT
BUT
NOW
HATH
HE
OBTAINED
A
MORE
EXCELLENT
MINISTRY
BY
HOW
MUCH
ALSO
HE
IS
THE
MEDIATOR
OF
A
BETTER
COVENANT
WHICH
WAS
ESTABLISHED
UPON
BETTER
PROMISES
FOR
IF
THAT
FIRST
COVENANT
HAD
BEEN
FAULTLESS
THEN
SHOULD
NO
PLACE
HAVE
BEEN
SOUGHT
FOR
THE
SECOND
FOR
FINDING
FAULT
WITH
THEM
HE
SAITH
BEHOLD
THE
DAYS
COME
SAITH
THE
LORD
WHEN
I
WILL
MAKE
A
NEW
COVENANT
WITH
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
AND
WITH
THE
HOUSE
OF
JUDAH
NOT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
COVENANT
THAT
I
MADE
WITH
THEIR
FATHERS
IN
THE
DAY
WHEN
I
TOOK
THEM
BY
THE
HAND
TO
LEAD
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
LAND
OF
EGYPT
BECAUSE
THEY
CONTINUED
NOT
IN
MY
COVENANT
AND
I
REGARDED
THEM
NOT
SAITH
THE
LORD
FOR
THIS
IS
THE
COVENANT
THAT
I
WILL
MAKE
WITH
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
AFTER
THOSE
DAYS
SAITH
THE
LORD
I
WILL
PUT
MY
LAWS
INTO
THEIR
MIND
AND
WRITE
THEM
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
AND
I
WILL
BE
TO
THEM
A
GOD
AND
THEY
SHALL
BE
TO
ME
A
PEOPLE
AND
THEY
SHALL
NOT
TEACH
EVERY
MAN
HIS
NEIGHBOUR
AND
EVERY
MAN
HIS
BROTHER
SAYING
KNOW
THE
LORD
FOR
ALL
SHALL
KNOW
ME
FROM
THE
LEAST
TO
THE
GREATEST
FOR
I
WILL
BE
MERCIFUL
TO
THEIR
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
AND
THEIR
SINS
AND
THEIR
INIQUITIES
WILL
I
REMEMBER
NO
MORE
IN
THAT
HE
SAITH
A
NEW
COVENANT
HE
HATH
MADE
THE
FIRST
OLD
NOW
THAT
WHICH
DECAYETH
AND
WAXETH
OLD
IS
READY
TO
VANISH
AWAY
THEN
VERILY
THE
FIRST
COVENANT
HAD
ALSO
ORDINANCES
OF
DIVINE
SERVICE
AND
A
WORLDLY
SANCTUARY
FOR
THERE
WAS
A
TABERNACLE
MADE
THE
FIRST
WHEREIN
WAS
THE
CANDLESTICK
AND
THE
TABLE
AND
THE
SHEWBREAD
WHICH
IS
CALLED
THE
SANCTUARY
AND
AFTER
THE
SECOND
VEIL
THE
TABERNACLE
WHICH
IS
CALLED
THE
HOLIEST
OF
ALL
WHICH
HAD
THE
GOLDEN
CENSER
AND
THE
ARK
OF
THE
COVENANT
OVERLAID
ROUND
ABOUT
WITH
GOLD
WHEREIN
WAS
THE
GOLDEN
POT
THAT
HAD
MANNA
AND
AARON'S
ROD
THAT
BUDDED
AND
THE
TABLES
OF
THE
COVENANT
AND
OVER
IT
THE
CHERUBIMS
OF
GLORY
SHADOWING
THE
MERCYSEAT
OF
WHICH
WE
CANNOT
NOW
SPEAK
PARTICULARLY
NOW
WHEN
THESE
THINGS
WERE
THUS
ORDAINED
THE
PRIESTS
WENT
ALWAYS
INTO
THE
FIRST
TABERNACLE
ACCOMPLISHING
THE
SERVICE
OF
GOD
BUT
INTO
THE
SECOND
WENT
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
ALONE
ONCE
EVERY
YEAR
NOT
WITHOUT
BLOOD
WHICH
HE
OFFERED
FOR
HIMSELF
AND
FOR
THE
ERRORS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THE
HOLY
GHOST
THIS
SIGNIFYING
THAT
THE
WAY
INTO
THE
HOLIEST
OF
ALL
WAS
NOT
YET
MADE
MANIFEST
WHILE
AS
THE
FIRST
TABERNACLE
WAS
YET
STANDING
WHICH
WAS
A
FIGURE
FOR
THE
TIME
THEN
PRESENT
IN
WHICH
WERE
OFFERED
BOTH
GIFTS
AND
SACRIFICES
THAT
COULD
NOT
MAKE
HIM
THAT
DID
THE
SERVICE
PERFECT
AS
PERTAINING
TO
THE
CONSCIENCE
WHICH
STOOD
ONLY
IN
MEATS
AND
DRINKS
AND
DIVERS
WASHINGS
AND
CARNAL
ORDINANCES
IMPOSED
ON
THEM
UNTIL
THE
TIME
OF
REFORMATION
BUT
CHRIST
BEING
COME
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
OF
GOOD
THINGS
TO
COME
BY
A
GREATER
AND
MORE
PERFECT
TABERNACLE
NOT
MADE
WITH
HANDS
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
NOT
OF
THIS
BUILDING
NEITHER
BY
THE
BLOOD
OF
GOATS
AND
CALVES
BUT
BY
HIS
OWN
BLOOD
HE
ENTERED
IN
ONCE
INTO
THE
HOLY
PLACE
HAVING
OBTAINED
ETERNAL
REDEMPTION
FOR
US
FOR
IF
THE
BLOOD
OF
BULLS
AND
OF
GOATS
AND
THE
ASHES
OF
AN
HEIFER
SPRINKLING
THE
UNCLEAN
SANCTIFIETH
TO
THE
PURIFYING
OF
THE
FLESH
HOW
MUCH
MORE
SHALL
THE
BLOOD
OF
CHRIST
WHO
THROUGH
THE
ETERNAL
SPIRIT
OFFERED
HIMSELF
WITHOUT
SPOT
TO
GOD
PURGE
YOUR
CONSCIENCE
FROM
DEAD
WORKS
TO
SERVE
THE
LIVING
GOD
AND
FOR
THIS
CAUSE
HE
IS
THE
MEDIATOR
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THAT
BY
MEANS
OF
DEATH
FOR
THE
REDEMPTION
OF
THE
TRANSGRESSIONS
THAT
WERE
UNDER
THE
FIRST
TESTAMENT
THEY
WHICH
ARE
CALLED
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE
PROMISE
OF
ETERNAL
INHERITANCE
FOR
WHERE
A
TESTAMENT
IS
THERE
MUST
ALSO
OF
NECESSITY
BE
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
TESTATOR
FOR
A
TESTAMENT
IS
OF
FORCE
AFTER
MEN
ARE
DEAD
OTHERWISE
IT
IS
OF
NO
STRENGTH
AT
ALL
WHILE
THE
TESTATOR
LIVETH
WHEREUPON
NEITHER
THE
FIRST
TESTAMENT
WAS
DEDICATED
WITHOUT
BLOOD
FOR
WHEN
MOSES
HAD
SPOKEN
EVERY
PRECEPT
TO
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LAW
HE
TOOK
THE
BLOOD
OF
CALVES
AND
OF
GOATS
WITH
WATER
AND
SCARLET
WOOL
AND
HYSSOP
AND
SPRINKLED
BOTH
THE
BOOK
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
SAYING
THIS
IS
THE
BLOOD
OF
THE
TESTAMENT
WHICH
GOD
HATH
ENJOINED
UNTO
YOU
MOREOVER
HE
SPRINKLED
WITH
BLOOD
BOTH
THE
TABERNACLE
AND
ALL
THE
VESSELS
OF
THE
MINISTRY
AND
ALMOST
ALL
THINGS
ARE
BY
THE
LAW
PURGED
WITH
BLOOD
AND
WITHOUT
SHEDDING
OF
BLOOD
IS
NO
REMISSION
IT
WAS
THEREFORE
NECESSARY
THAT
THE
PATTERNS
OF
THINGS
IN
THE

WITH

BUT
THE
HEAVENLY
THINGS
THEMSELVES
WITH
BETTER
SACRIFICES
THAN
THESE
FOR
CHRIST
IS
NOT
ENTERED
INTO
THE
HOLY
PLACES
MADE
WITH
HANDS
WHICH
ARE
THE
FIGURES
OF
THE
TRUE
BUT
INTO
HEAVEN
ITSELF
NOW
TO
APPEAR
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
FOR

NOR

THAT
HE
SHOULD
OFFER
HIMSELF
OFTEN
AS
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
ENTERETH
INTO
THE

PLACE
EVERY

WITH
BLOOD
OF
OTHERS
FOR
THEN
MUST
HE
OFTEN
HAVE
SUFFERED
SINCE
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
WORLD
BUT
NOW
ONCE
IN
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
HATH
HE
APPEARED
TO
PUT
AWAY
SIN
BY
THE
SACRIFICE
OF
HIMSELF
AND
AS
IT
IS
APPOINTED
UNTO
MEN
ONCE
TO
DIE
BUT
AFTER
THIS
THE
JUDGMENT
SO
CHRIST
WAS
ONCE
OFFERED
TO
BEAR
THE
SINS
OF
MANY
AND
UNTO
THEM
THAT
LOOK
FOR
HIM
SHALL
HE
APPEAR
THE
SECOND
TIME
WITHOUT
SIN
UNTO
SALVATION
FOR
THE
LAW
HAVING
A
SHADOW
OF
GOOD
THINGS
TO
COME
AND
NOT
THE
VERY
IMAGE
OF
THE
THINGS
CAN
NEVER
WITH
THOSE
SACRIFICES
WHICH
THEY
OFFERED
YEAR
BY
YEAR
CONTINUALLY
MAKE
THE
COMERS
THEREUNTO
PERFECT
FOR
THEN
WOULD
THEY
NOT
HAVE
CEASED
TO
BE
OFFERED
BECAUSE
THAT
THE
WORSHIPPERS
ONCE
PURGED
SHOULD
HAVE
HAD
NO
MORE
CONSCIENCE
OF
SINS
BUT
IN
THOSE
SACRIFICES
THERE
IS
A
REMEMBRANCE
AGAIN
MADE
OF
SINS
EVERY
YEAR
FOR
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
BLOOD
OF
BULLS
AND
OF
GOATS
SHOULD
TAKE
AWAY
SINS
WHEREFORE
WHEN
HE
COMETH
INTO
THE
WORLD
HE
SAITH
SACRIFICE
AND
OFFERING
THOU
WOULDEST
NOT

A

HAST
THOU

THOU

O

HE
TAKETH
AWAY
THE
FIRST
THAT

MAY
ESTABLISH
THE

BY

WE
ARE

THROUGH
THE

OF
THE

FOR

STANDETH
DAILY
MINISTERING
AND

OFTENTIMES
THE

SACRIFICES
WHICH
CAN
NEVER
TAKE
AWAY

BUT
THIS
MAN
AFTER

OFFERED
ONE
SACRIFICE
FOR

FOR

SAT
DOWN
ON
THE
RIGHT
HAND
OF
GOD
FROM
HENCEFORTH
EXPECTING
TILL
HIS

BE
MADE
HIS

FOR
BY

HE
HATH
PERFECTED
FOR

THEM
THAT
ARE
SANCTIFIED
WHEREOF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
ALSO
IS
A
WITNESS
TO
US
FOR
AFTER
THAT
HE
HAD
SAID
BEFORE
THIS
IS
THE
COVENANT
THAT
I
WILL
MAKE
WITH
THEM
AFTER
THOSE
DAYS
SAITH
THE
LORD
I
WILL
PUT
MY
LAWS
INTO
THEIR
HEARTS
AND
IN
THEIR
MINDS
WILL
I
WRITE
THEM
AND
THEIR
SINS
AND
INIQUITIES
WILL
I
REMEMBER
NO
MORE
NOW
WHERE
REMISSION
OF
THESE
IS
THERE
IS
NO
MORE
OFFERING
FOR
SIN
HAVING
THEREFORE
BRETHREN
BOLDNESS
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
HOLIEST
BY
THE
BLOOD
OF
JESUS
BY
A
NEW
AND
LIVING
WAY
WHICH
HE
HATH
CONSECRATED
FOR
US
THROUGH
THE
VEIL
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
HIS
FLESH
AND
HAVING
AN
HIGH
PRIEST
OVER
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
LET
US
DRAW
NEAR
WITH
A
TRUE
HEART
IN
FULL
ASSURANCE
OF
FAITH
HAVING
OUR
HEARTS
SPRINKLED
FROM
AN
EVIL
CONSCIENCE
AND
OUR
BODIES
WASHED
WITH
PURE
WATER
LET
US
HOLD
FAST
THE
PROFESSION
OF
OUR
FAITH
WITHOUT
WAVERING
FOR
HE
IS
FAITHFUL
THAT
PROMISED
AND
LET
US
CONSIDER
ONE
ANOTHER
TO
PROVOKE
UNTO
LOVE
AND
TO
GOOD
WORKS
NOT
FORSAKING
THE
ASSEMBLING
OF
OURSELVES
TOGETHER
AS
THE
MANNER
OF
SOME
IS
BUT
EXHORTING
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
SO
MUCH
THE
MORE
AS
YE
SEE
THE
DAY
APPROACHING
FOR
IF
WE
SIN
WILFULLY
AFTER
THAT
WE
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
TRUTH
THERE
REMAINETH
NO
MORE
SACRIFICE
FOR
SINS
BUT
A
CERTAIN
FEARFUL
LOOKING
FOR
OF
JUDGMENT
AND
FIERY
INDIGNATION
WHICH
SHALL
DEVOUR
THE
ADVERSARIES
HE
THAT
DESPISED
MOSES'
LAW
DIED
WITHOUT
MERCY
UNDER
TWO
OR
THREE
WITNESSES
OF
HOW
MUCH
SORER
PUNISHMENT
SUPPOSE
YE
SHALL
HE
BE
THOUGHT
WORTHY
WHO
HATH
TRODDEN
UNDER
FOOT
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
HATH
COUNTED
THE
BLOOD
OF
THE
COVENANT
WHEREWITH
HE
WAS
SANCTIFIED
AN
UNHOLY
THING
AND
HATH
DONE
DESPITE
UNTO
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GRACE
FOR
WE
KNOW
HIM
THAT
HATH
SAID
VENGEANCE
BELONGETH
UNTO
ME
I
WILL
RECOMPENSE
SAITH
THE
LORD
AND
AGAIN
THE
LORD
SHALL
JUDGE
HIS
PEOPLE
IT
IS
A
FEARFUL
THING
TO
FALL
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
BUT
CALL
TO
REMEMBRANCE
THE
FORMER
DAYS
IN
WHICH
AFTER
YE
WERE
ILLUMINATED
YE
ENDURED
A
GREAT
FIGHT
OF
AFFLICTIONS
PARTLY
WHILST
YE
WERE
MADE
A
GAZINGSTOCK
BOTH
BY
REPROACHES
AND
AFFLICTIONS
AND
PARTLY
WHILST
YE
BECAME
COMPANIONS
OF
THEM
THAT
WERE
SO
USED
FOR
YE
HAD
COMPASSION
OF
ME
IN
MY
BONDS
AND
TOOK
JOYFULLY
THE
SPOILING
OF
YOUR
GOODS
KNOWING
IN
YOURSELVES
THAT
YE
HAVE
IN
HEAVEN
A
BETTER
AND
AN
ENDURING
SUBSTANCE
CAST
NOT
AWAY
THEREFORE
YOUR
CONFIDENCE
WHICH
HATH
GREAT
RECOMPENCE
OF
REWARD
FOR
YE
HAVE
NEED
OF
PATIENCE
THAT
AFTER
YE
HAVE
DONE
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
YE
MIGHT
RECEIVE
THE
PROMISE
FOR
YET
A
LITTLE
WHILE
AND
HE
THAT
SHALL
COME
WILL
COME
AND
WILL
NOT
TARRY
NOW
THE
JUST
SHALL
LIVE
BY
FAITH
BUT
IF
ANY
MAN
DRAW
BACK
MY
SOUL
SHALL
HAVE
NO
PLEASURE
IN
HIM
BUT
WE
ARE
NOT
OF
THEM
WHO
DRAW
BACK
UNTO
PERDITION
BUT
OF
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
TO
THE
SAVING
OF
THE
SOUL
NOW
FAITH
IS
THE
SUBSTANCE
OF
THINGS
HOPED
FOR
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THINGS
NOT
SEEN
FOR
BY
IT
THE
ELDERS
OBTAINED
A
GOOD
REPORT
THROUGH
FAITH
WE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
WORLDS
WERE
FRAMED
BY
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
SO
THAT
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
SEEN
WERE
NOT
MADE
OF
THINGS
WHICH
DO
APPEAR
BY
FAITH
ABEL
OFFERED
UNTO
GOD
A
MORE
EXCELLENT
SACRIFICE
THAN
CAIN
BY
WHICH
HE
OBTAINED
WITNESS
THAT
HE
WAS
RIGHTEOUS
GOD
TESTIFYING
OF
HIS
GIFTS
AND
BY
IT
HE
BEING
DEAD
YET
SPEAKETH
BY
FAITH
ENOCH
WAS
TRANSLATED
THAT
HE
SHOULD
NOT
SEE
DEATH
AND
WAS
NOT
FOUND
BECAUSE
GOD
HAD
TRANSLATED
HIM
FOR
BEFORE
HIS
TRANSLATION
HE
HAD
THIS
TESTIMONY
THAT
HE
PLEASED
GOD
BUT
WITHOUT
FAITH
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
PLEASE
HIM
FOR
HE
THAT
COMETH
TO
GOD
MUST
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
IS
AND
THAT
HE
IS
A
REWARDER
OF
THEM
THAT
DILIGENTLY
SEEK
HIM
BY
FAITH
NOAH
BEING
WARNED
OF
GOD
OF
THINGS
NOT

AS

MOVED
WITH

PREPARED
AN
ARK
TO
THE
SAVING
OF
HIS

BY
THE
WHICH
HE
CONDEMNED
THE

AND
BECAME
HEIR
OF
THE

WHICH
IS
BY

BY

ABRAHAM
WHEN
HE
WAS
CALLED
TO
GO
OUT
INTO
A
PLACE
WHICH
HE
SHOULD
AFTER

FOR
AN
INHERITANCE
OBEYED
AND
HE
WENT
OUT
NOT
KNOWING
WHITHER
HE
WENT
BY
FAITH
HE
SOJOURNED
IN
THE
LAND
OF
PROMISE
AS
IN
A
STRANGE
COUNTRY
DWELLING
IN
TABERNACLES
WITH
ISAAC
AND
JACOB
THE
HEIRS
WITH

OF
THE

LOOKED
FOR
A

HATH

WHOSE
BUILDER

IS
GOD
THROUGH

ALSO
SARA
HERSELF
RECEIVED
STRENGTH
TO
CONCEIVE
SEED
AND
WAS
DELIVERED
OF
A
CHILD
WHEN
SHE
WAS
PAST

BECAUSE
SHE
JUDGED
HIM
FAITHFUL
WHO
HAD
PROMISED
THEREFORE
SPRANG
THERE
EVEN
OF

AND
HIM
AS
GOOD
AS
DEAD
SO
MANY
AS
THE
STARS
OF
THE
SKY
IN
MULTITUDE
AND
AS
THE
SAND
WHICH
IS
BY
THE

SHORE
INNUMERABLE
THESE
ALL
DIED
IN

NOT
HAVING
RECEIVED
THE
PROMISES
BUT
HAVING
SEEN

AFAR
OFF
AND
WERE
PERSUADED
OF
THEM
AND
EMBRACED
THEM
AND
CONFESSED
THAT
THEY
WERE
STRANGERS
AND

ON
THE

FOR
THEY
THAT
SAY
SUCH

DECLARE
PLAINLY
THAT

BEEN
MINDFUL
OF
THAT

FROM
WHENCE
THEY

OUT
THEY

OPPORTUNITY
TO

NOW
THEY
DESIRE
A
BETTER

THAT
IS
AN
HEAVENLY
WHEREFORE
GOD
IS
NOT
ASHAMED
TO
BE
CALLED
THEIR

FOR
HE
HATH
PREPARED
FOR

A

ABRAHAM
WHEN

LEANING
UPON

CONCERNING

BY

MOSES
WHEN

BY

MOSES
WHEN

OF

FOR
A

ESTEEMING
THE

OF

GREATER
RICHES
THAN

UNTO
THE

OF
THE

BY

HE
FORSOOK
EGYPT
NOT

SIGNIFIETH
THE
REMOVING

THAT
THOSE

STRANGE
DOCTRINES
FOR
IT
IS
A

THAT
THE

BE
ESTABLISHED
WITH

WHICH

THEM
THAT

WHEREOF
THEY
HAVE
NO

FOR
HERE
HAVE

OFFER
THE
SACRIFICE
OF

TO
GOD
CONTINUALLY
THAT
IS
THE
FRUIT
OF
OUR

GIVING
THANKS
TO

NOT

THE

BUT
CHIEFLY
THEM
THAT
WALK
AFTER
THE

IN
THE
LUST
OF
UNCLEANNESS
AND
DESPISE
GOVERNMENT
PRESUMPTUOUS
ARE
THEY
SELFWILLED
THEY
ARE
NOT

WHEREAS
ANGELS
WHICH
ARE
GREATER
IN
POWER
AND
MIGHT
BRING
NOT

ACCUSATION
AGAINST

BEFORE
THE

BUT
THESE
AS
NATURAL
BRUTE
BEASTS
MADE
TO
BE
TAKEN
AND
DESTROYED
SPEAK
EVIL
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
THEY
UNDERSTAND
NOT

SHALL
UTTERLY
PERISH
IN
THEIR

CORRUPTION
AND
SHALL
RECEIVE
THE

OF
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
AS
THEY
THAT
COUNT
IT
PLEASURE
TO
RIOT
IN
THE

TIME
SPOTS
THEY
ARE
AND
BLEMISHES
SPORTING
THEMSELVES
WITH
THEIR

DECEIVINGS
WHILE
THEY
FEAST
WITH
YOU
HAVING
EYES
FULL
OF
ADULTERY
AND
THAT
CANNOT
CEASE
FROM
SIN
BEGUILING
UNSTABLE
SOULS
AN
HEART
THEY
HAVE
EXERCISED
WITH
COVETOUS
PRACTICES
CURSED
CHILDREN
WHICH
HAVE
FORSAKEN
THE
RIGHT
WAY
AND
ARE
GONE
ASTRAY
FOLLOWING
THE

OF
BALAAM
THE
SON
OF
BOSOR
WHO
LOVED
THE
WAGES
OF
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
BUT
WAS
REBUKED
FOR
HIS
INIQUITY
THE
DUMB
ASS
SPEAKING
WITH
MAN'S

FORBAD
THE

THESE

CLOUDS
THAT
ARE
CARRIED
WITH
A

TO
WHOM
THE

IS

WHEN
THEY
SPEAK
GREAT
SWELLING
WORDS
OF
VANITY
THEY
ALLURE
THROUGH
THE
LUSTS
OF
THE

THROUGH
MUCH
WANTONNESS
THOSE
THAT
WERE
CLEAN
ESCAPED
FROM
THEM
WHO
LIVE
IN

LIBERTY
THEY
THEMSELVES
ARE
THE

OF
CORRUPTION
FOR
OF
WHOM
A

IS
OVERCOME
OF
THE

HE
BROUGHT
IN

AFTER
THEY
HAVE
ESCAPED
THE

OF
THE

THROUGH
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
SAVIOUR
JESUS
CHRIST
THEY
ARE
AGAIN
ENTANGLED
THEREIN
AND
OVERCOME
THE
LATTER
END
IS
WORSE
WITH
THEM
THAN
THE
BEGINNING
FOR
IT
HAD
BEEN
BETTER
FOR
THEM
NOT
TO
HAVE
KNOWN
THE
WAY
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
THAN
AFTER
THEY
HAVE
KNOWN
IT
TO
TURN
FROM
THE
HOLY
COMMANDMENT
DELIVERED
UNTO
THEM
BUT
IT
IS
HAPPENED
UNTO
THEM
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TRUE
PROVERB
THE

TO
HIS

VOMIT
AGAIN

NOW
WRITE

STIR
UP
YOUR

THAT
YE
MAY
BE
MINDFUL
OF
THE
WORDS
WHICH
WERE
SPOKEN
BEFORE
BY
THE
HOLY
PROPHETS
AND
OF
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
US
THE
APOSTLES
OF
THE
LORD
AND

KNOWING
THIS
FIRST
THAT
THERE
SHALL
COME
IN
THE
LAST
DAYS
SCOFFERS
WALKING
AFTER
THEIR
OWN
LUSTS
AND
SAYING
WHERE
IS
THE
PROMISE
OF
HIS
COMING
FOR
SINCE
THE
FATHERS
FELL
ASLEEP
ALL
THINGS
CONTINUE
AS
THEY
WERE
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
CREATION
FOR
THIS
THEY
WILLINGLY
ARE
IGNORANT
OF
THAT
BY
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
THE
HEAVENS
WERE
OF

AND
THE
EARTH
STANDING
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
AND
IN
THE
WATER
WHEREBY
THE
WORLD
THAT
THEN
WAS
BEING
OVERFLOWED
WITH

WHICH
ARE
NOW
BY
THE

WORD
ARE
KEPT
IN

UNTO
FIRE
AGAINST
THE

IS
NOT

MEN
COUNT
SLACKNESS
BUT
IS
LONGSUFFERING
TO
US-WARD
NOT
WILLING
THAT
ANY
SHOULD
PERISH
BUT
THAT
ALL
SHOULD
COME
TO
REPENTANCE
BUT
THE
DAY
OF
THE

WILL
COME
AS
A
THIEF
IN
THE
NIGHT
IN
THE
WHICH
THE
HEAVENS

PASS
AWAY
WITH

ROUND
ABOUT
THE

IN
SIGHT
LIKE
UNTO
AN

INHABITERS
OF
THE
EARTH
BY
REASON
OF
THE
OTHER
VOICES
OF
THE
TRUMPET
OF
THE
THREE
ANGELS
WHICH
ARE
YET
TO
SOUND
AND
THE
FIFTH
ANGEL
SOUNDED
AND
I
SAW
A
STAR
FALL
FROM
HEAVEN
UNTO
THE
EARTH
AND
TO
HIM
WAS
GIVEN
THE
KEY
OF
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
AND
HE
OPENED
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
AND
THERE
AROSE
A
SMOKE
OUT
OF
THE
PIT
AS
THE
SMOKE
OF
A
GREAT
FURNACE
AND
THE
SUN
AND
THE
AIR
WERE
DARKENED
BY
REASON
OF
THE
SMOKE
OF
THE
PIT
AND
THERE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
SMOKE
LOCUSTS
UPON
THE
EARTH
AND
UNTO
THEM
WAS
GIVEN
POWER
AS
THE
SCORPIONS
OF
THE
EARTH
HAVE
POWER
AND
IT
WAS
COMMANDED
THEM
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
HURT
THE
GRASS
OF
THE
EARTH
NEITHER
ANY
GREEN
THING
NEITHER
ANY
TREE
BUT
ONLY
THOSE
MEN
WHICH
HAVE
NOT
THE
SEAL
OF
GOD
IN
THEIR
FOREHEADS
AND
TO
THEM
IT
WAS
GIVEN
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
KILL
THEM
BUT
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
TORMENTED
FIVE
MONTHS
AND
THEIR
TORMENT
WAS
AS
THE
TORMENT
OF
A
SCORPION
WHEN
HE
STRIKETH
A
MAN
AND
IN
THOSE
DAYS
SHALL
MEN
SEEK
DEATH
AND
SHALL
NOT
FIND
IT
AND
SHALL
DESIRE
TO
DIE
AND
DEATH
SHALL
FLEE
FROM
THEM
AND
THE
SHAPES
OF
THE
LOCUSTS
WERE
LIKE
UNTO
HORSES
PREPARED
UNTO
BATTLE
AND
ON
THEIR
HEADS
WERE
AS
IT
WERE
CROWNS
LIKE
GOLD
AND
THEIR
FACES
WERE
AS
THE
FACES
OF
MEN
AND
THEY
HAD
HAIR
AS
THE
HAIR
OF
WOMEN
AND
THEIR
TEETH
WERE
AS
THE
TEETH
OF
LIONS
AND
THEY
HAD
BREASTPLATES
AS
IT
WERE
BREASTPLATES
OF
IRON
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
THEIR
WINGS
WAS
AS
THE
SOUND
OF
CHARIOTS
OF
MANY
HORSES
RUNNING
TO
BATTLE
AND
THEY
HAD
TAILS
LIKE
UNTO
SCORPIONS
AND
THERE
WERE
STINGS
IN
THEIR
TAILS
AND
THEIR
POWER
WAS
TO
HURT
MEN
FIVE
MONTHS
AND
THEY
HAD
A
KING
OVER
THEM
WHICH
IS
THE
ANGEL
OF
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
WHOSE
NAME
IN
THE
HEBREW
TONGUE
IS
ABADDON
BUT
IN
THE
GREEK
TONGUE
HATH
HIS
NAME
APOLLYON
ONE
WOE
IS
PAST
AND
BEHOLD
THERE
COME
TWO
WOES
MORE
HEREAFTER
AND
THE
SIXTH
ANGEL
SOUNDED
AND
I
HEARD
A
VOICE
FROM
THE
FOUR
HORNS
OF
THE
GOLDEN
ALTAR
WHICH
IS
BEFORE
GOD
SAYING
TO
THE
SIXTH
ANGEL
WHICH
HAD
THE
TRUMPET
LOOSE
THE
FOUR
ANGELS
WHICH
ARE
BOUND
IN
THE
GREAT
RIVER
EUPHRATES
AND
THE
FOUR
ANGELS
WERE
LOOSED
WHICH
WERE
PREPARED
FOR
AN
HOUR
AND
A
DAY
AND
A
MONTH
AND
A
YEAR
FOR
TO
SLAY
THE
THIRD
PART
OF
MEN
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
ARMY
OF
THE
HORSEMEN
WERE
TWO
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
THOUSAND
AND
I
HEARD
THE
NUMBER
OF
THEM
AND
THUS
I
SAW
THE
HORSES
IN
THE
VISION
AND
THEM
THAT
SAT
ON
THEM
HAVING
BREASTPLATES
OF
FIRE
AND
OF
JACINTH
AND
BRIMSTONE
AND
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
HORSES
WERE
AS
THE
HEADS
OF
LIONS
AND
OUT
OF
THEIR
MOUTHS
ISSUED
FIRE
AND
SMOKE
AND
BRIMSTONE
BY
THESE
THREE
WAS
THE
THIRD
PART
OF
MEN
KILLED
BY
THE
FIRE
AND
BY
THE
SMOKE
AND
BY
THE
BRIMSTONE
WHICH
ISSUED
OUT
OF
THEIR
MOUTHS
FOR
THEIR
POWER
IS
IN
THEIR
MOUTH
AND
IN
THEIR
TAILS
FOR
THEIR
TAILS
WERE
LIKE
UNTO
SERPENTS
AND
HAD
HEADS
AND
WITH
THEM
THEY
DO
HURT
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
MEN
WHICH
WERE
NOT
KILLED
BY
THESE
PLAGUES
YET
REPENTED
NOT
OF
THE
WORKS
OF
THEIR
HANDS
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
WORSHIP
DEVILS
AND
IDOLS
OF
GOLD
AND
SILVER
AND
BRASS
AND
STONE
AND
OF
WOOD
WHICH
NEITHER
CAN
SEE
NOR
HEAR
NOR
WALK
NEITHER
REPENTED
THEY
OF
THEIR
MURDERS
NOR
OF
THEIR
SORCERIES
NOR
OF
THEIR
FORNICATION
NOR
OF
THEIR
THEFTS
AND
I
SAW
ANOTHER
MIGHTY
ANGEL
COME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
CLOTHED
WITH
A
CLOUD
AND
A
RAINBOW
WAS
UPON
HIS
HEAD
AND
HIS
FACE
WAS
AS
IT
WERE
THE
SUN
AND
HIS
FEET
AS
PILLARS
OF
FIRE
AND
HE
HAD
IN
HIS
HAND
A
LITTLE
BOOK
OPEN
AND
HE
SET
HIS
RIGHT
FOOT
UPON
THE
SEA
AND
HIS
LEFT
FOOT
ON
THE
EARTH
AND
CRIED
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
AS
WHEN
A
LION
ROARETH
AND
WHEN
HE
HAD
CRIED
SEVEN
THUNDERS
UTTERED
THEIR
VOICES
AND
WHEN
THE
SEVEN
THUNDERS
HAD
UTTERED
THEIR
VOICES
I
WAS
ABOUT
TO
WRITE
AND
I
HEARD
A
VOICE
FROM
HEAVEN
SAYING
UNTO
ME
SEAL
UP
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
THE
SEVEN
THUNDERS
UTTERED
AND
WRITE
THEM
NOT
AND
THE
ANGEL
WHICH
I
SAW
STAND
UPON
THE
SEA
AND
UPON
THE
EARTH
LIFTED
UP
HIS
HAND
TO
HEAVEN
AND
SWARE
BY
HIM
THAT
LIVETH
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER
WHO
CREATED
HEAVEN
AND
THE
THINGS
THAT
THEREIN
ARE
AND
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
THINGS
THAT
THEREIN
ARE
AND
THE
SEA
AND
THE
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
THEREIN
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
TIME
NO
LONGER
BUT
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
SEVENTH
ANGEL
WHEN
HE
SHALL
BEGIN
TO
SOUND
THE
MYSTERY
OF
GOD
SHOULD
BE
FINISHED
AS
HE
HATH
DECLARED
TO
HIS
SERVANTS
THE
PROPHETS
AND
THE
VOICE
WHICH
I
HEARD
FROM
HEAVEN
SPAKE
UNTO
ME
AGAIN
AND
SAID
GO
AND
TAKE
THE
LITTLE
BOOK
WHICH
IS
OPEN
IN
THE
HAND
OF
THE
ANGEL
WHICH
STANDETH
UPON
THE
SEA
AND
UPON
THE
EARTH
AND
I
WENT
UNTO
THE
ANGEL
AND
SAID
UNTO
HIM
GIVE
ME
THE
LITTLE
BOOK
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
TAKE
IT
AND
EAT
IT
UP
AND
IT
SHALL
MAKE
THY
BELLY
BITTER
BUT
IT
SHALL
BE
IN
THY
MOUTH
SWEET
AS
HONEY
AND
I
TOOK
THE
LITTLE
BOOK
OUT
OF
THE
ANGEL'S
HAND
AND
ATE
IT
UP
AND
IT
WAS
IN
MY
MOUTH
SWEET
AS
HONEY
AND
AS
SOON
AS
I
HAD
EATEN
IT
MY
BELLY
WAS
BITTER
AND
HE
SAID
UNTO
ME
THOU
MUST
PROPHESY
AGAIN
BEFORE
MANY
PEOPLES
AND
NATIONS
AND
TONGUES
AND
KINGS
AND
THERE
WAS
GIVEN
ME
A
REED
LIKE
UNTO
A
ROD
AND
THE
ANGEL
STOOD
SAYING
RISE
AND
MEASURE
THE
TEMPLE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
ALTAR
AND
THEM
THAT
WORSHIP
THEREIN
BUT
THE
COURT
WHICH
IS
WITHOUT
THE
TEMPLE
LEAVE
OUT
AND
MEASURE
IT
NOT
FOR
IT
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
THE
GENTILES
AND
THE
HOLY
CITY
SHALL
THEY
TREAD
UNDER
FOOT
FORTY
AND
TWO
MONTHS
AND
I
WILL
GIVE
POWER
UNTO
MY
TWO
WITNESSES
AND
THEY
SHALL
PROPHESY
A
THOUSAND
TWO
HUNDRED
AND
THREESCORE
DAYS
CLOTHED
IN
SACKCLOTH
THESE
ARE
THE
TWO
OLIVE
TREES
AND
THE
TWO
CANDLESTICKS
STANDING
BEFORE
THE
GOD
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
WILL
HURT
THEM
FIRE
PROCEEDETH
OUT
OF
THEIR
MOUTH
AND
DEVOURETH
THEIR
ENEMIES
AND
IF
ANY
MAN
WILL
HURT
THEM
HE
MUST
IN
THIS
MANNER
BE
KILLED
THESE
HAVE
POWER
TO
SHUT
HEAVEN
THAT
IT
RAIN
NOT
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
THEIR
PROPHECY
AND
HAVE
POWER
OVER
WATERS
TO
TURN
THEM
TO
BLOOD
AND
TO
SMITE
THE
EARTH
WITH
ALL
PLAGUES
AS
OFTEN
AS
THEY
WILL
AND
WHEN
THEY
SHALL
HAVE
FINISHED
THEIR
TESTIMONY
THE
BEAST
THAT
ASCENDETH
OUT
OF
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
SHALL
MAKE
WAR
AGAINST
THEM
AND
SHALL
OVERCOME
THEM
AND
KILL
THEM
AND
THEIR
DEAD
BODIES
SHALL
LIE
IN
THE
STREET
OF
THE
GREAT
CITY
WHICH
SPIRITUALLY
IS
CALLED
SODOM
AND
EGYPT
WHERE
ALSO
OUR
LORD
WAS
CRUCIFIED
AND
THEY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
KINDREDS
AND
TONGUES
AND
NATIONS
SHALL
SEE
THEIR
DEAD
BODIES
THREE
DAYS
AND
AN
HALF
AND
SHALL
NOT
SUFFER
THEIR
DEAD
BODIES
TO
BE
PUT
IN
GRAVES
AND
THEY
THAT
DWELL
UPON
THE
EARTH
SHALL
REJOICE
OVER
THEM
AND
MAKE
MERRY
AND
SHALL
SEND
GIFTS
ONE
TO
ANOTHER
BECAUSE
THESE
TWO
PROPHETS
TORMENTED
THEM

TESTAMENT
AND
THERE
WERE
LIGHTNINGS

THUNDERINGS
AND
AN

GREAT
HAIL
AND
THERE
APPEARED
A
GREAT
WONDER
IN
HEAVEN
A
WOMAN
CLOTHED
WITH

AND
DID
CAST
THEM
TO
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
DRAGON
STOOD
BEFORE
THE
WOMAN
WHICH
WAS
READY
TO
BE
DELIVERED
FOR
TO
DEVOUR
HER
CHILD
AS
SOON
AS
IT
WAS
BORN
AND
SHE
BROUGHT
FORTH
A
MAN
CHILD
WHO
WAS
TO
RULE
ALL
NATIONS
WITH
A
ROD
OF
IRON
AND
HER

BUT
A

TIME
AND
WHEN
THE
DRAGON
SAW
THAT

WAS
CAST
UNTO
THE

HE
PERSECUTED
THE
WOMAN
WHICH
BROUGHT
FORTH
THE
MAN
CHILD
AND
TO

TWO
WINGS

AFTER
THE
WOMAN
THAT
HE
MIGHT
CAUSE
HER

BE
CARRIED
AWAY
OF
THE
FLOOD
AND
THE

HELPED
THE

AND
THE
EARTH
OPENED
HER
MOUTH
AND
SWALLOWED
UP
THE
FLOOD
WHICH
THE
DRAGON
CAST
OUT
OF

WAR
WITH
THE
REMNANT
OF
HER
SEED
WHICH
KEEP
THE
COMMANDMENTS
OF
GOD
AND
HAVE
THE
TESTIMONY
OF
JESUS

AND
I
STOOD
UPON
THE
SAND
OF
THE
SEA
AND
SAW
A
BEAST
RISE
UP
OUT
OF
THE

HAVING
SEVEN
HEADS

TEN
HORNS
AND
UPON
HIS
HORNS
TEN
CROWNS
AND
UPON

THE
NAME

BLASPHEMY
AND
THE
BEAST
WHICH
I
SAW
WAS
LIKE
UNTO
A
LEOPARD
AND
HIS
FEET
WERE
AS
THE
FEET
OF
A
BEAR
AND
HIS
MOUTH
AS
THE
MOUTH
OF
A
LION
AND
THE
DRAGON
GAVE
HIM
HIS
POWER
AND
HIS
SEAT
AND
GREAT
AUTHORITY
AND
I
SAW
ONE
OF
HIS
HEADS
AS
IT
WERE
WOUNDED
TO
DEATH
AND
HIS
DEADLY
WOUND
WAS
HEALED
AND
ALL
THE
WORLD
WONDERED
AFTER
THE
BEAST
AND
THEY
WORSHIPPED
THE
DRAGON
WHICH
GAVE
POWER
UNTO
THE
BEAST
AND
THEY
WORSHIPPED
THE
BEAST
SAYING
WHO
IS
LIKE
UNTO
THE
BEAST
WHO
IS
ABLE
TO
MAKE
WAR
WITH
HIM
AND
THERE
WAS
GIVEN
UNTO
HIM
A
MOUTH
SPEAKING
GREAT
THINGS
AND
BLASPHEMIES
AND
POWER
WAS
GIVEN
UNTO
HIM
TO
CONTINUE
FORTY
AND
TWO
MONTHS
AND
HE
OPENED
HIS
MOUTH
IN
BLASPHEMY
AGAINST
GOD
TO
BLASPHEME
HIS
NAME
AND
HIS
TABERNACLE
AND
THEM
THAT
DWELL
IN
HEAVEN
AND
IT
WAS
GIVEN
UNTO
HIM
TO
MAKE
WAR
WITH
THE
SAINTS
AND
TO
OVERCOME
THEM
AND
POWER
WAS
GIVEN
HIM
OVER
ALL
KINDREDS
AND
TONGUES
AND
NATIONS
AND
ALL
THAT
DWELL
UPON
THE
EARTH
SHALL
WORSHIP
HIM
WHOSE
NAMES
ARE
NOT

INTO
CAPTIVITY
SHALL
GO
INTO
CAPTIVITY
HE
THAT
KILLETH
WITH
THE
SWORD
MUST
BE
KILLED
WITH
THE
SWORD
HERE
IS
THE
PATIENCE
AND
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
SAINTS
AND
I
BEHELD
ANOTHER
BEAST
COMING
UP
OUT
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
HE
HAD
TWO
HORNS
LIKE
A
LAMB
AND
HE
SPAKE
AS
A
DRAGON
AND
HE
EXERCISETH
ALL
THE
POWER
OF
THE
FIRST
BEAST
BEFORE
HIM
AND
CAUSETH
THE
EARTH
AND
THEM
WHICH
DWELL
THEREIN
TO
WORSHIP
THE
FIRST
BEAST
WHOSE
DEADLY
WOUND
WAS
HEALED
AND
HE
DOETH
GREAT
WONDERS
SO
THAT
HE
MAKETH
FIRE
COME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
MEN
AND
DECEIVETH
THEM
THAT
DWELL
ON
THE
EARTH
BY
THE
MEANS
OF
THOSE
MIRACLES
WHICH
HE
HAD
POWER
TO
DO
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
BEAST
SAYING
TO
THEM
THAT
DWELL
ON
THE
EARTH
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
MAKE
AN
IMAGE
TO
THE
BEAST
WHICH
HAD
THE
WOUND
BY
A
SWORD
AND
DID
LIVE
AND
HE
HAD
POWER
TO
GIVE
LIFE
UNTO
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
BEAST
THAT
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
BEAST
SHOULD
BOTH
SPEAK
AND
CAUSE
THAT
AS
MANY
AS
WOULD
NOT
WORSHIP
THE
IMAGE
OF
THE
BEAST
SHOULD
BE
KILLED
AND
HE
CAUSETH
ALL
BOTH
SMALL
AND
GREAT
RICH
AND
POOR
FREE
AND
BOND
TO
RECEIVE
A
MARK
IN

UPON
THE
SEAT
OF
THE
BEAST
AND
HIS

WAS
FULL
OF
DARKNESS

AND
THERE
CAME
ONE
OF
THE
SEVEN
ANGELS

HE
DOTH
JUDGE

HIS

WERE
MANY
CROWNS
AND
HE
HAD
A

WRITTEN
THAT
NO
MAN
KNEW

HE
HIMSELF
AND
HE
WAS
CLOTHED
WITH
A

WHICH
WERE
IN
HEAVEN
FOLLOWED
HIM
UPON
WHITE
HORSES
CLOTHED
IN
FINE
LINEN
WHITE
AND
CLEAN
AND
OUT
OF
HIS
MOUTH
GOETH
A
SHARP
SWORD
THAT
WITH
IT
HE
SHOULD
SMITE
THE
NATIONS
AND
HE
SHALL
RULE
THEM
WITH
A
ROD
OF
IRON
AND
HE
TREADETH
THE
WINEPRESS
OF
THE
FIERCENESS
AND
WRATH
OF

KING
OF

CRIED
WITH
A
LOUD
VOICE
SAYING
TO
ALL
THE
FOWLS
THAT
FLY
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
HEAVEN
COME
AND
GATHER
YOURSELVES
TOGETHER
UNTO
THE
SUPPER
OF
THE

GOD
THAT
YE
MAY
EAT
THE

OF
THEM
THAT
SIT
ON

BOTH
FREE

BOTH
SMALL

AND
I
SAW
THE
BEAST
AND
THE
KINGS
OF
THE
EARTH
AND
THEIR
ARMIES
GATHERED
TOGETHER
TO
MAKE
WAR
AGAINST
HIM
THAT
SAT
ON
THE
HORSE
AND
AGAINST
HIS
ARMY
AND
THE
BEAST
WAS
TAKEN
AND
WITH
HIM
THE
FALSE
PROPHET
THAT
WROUGHT
MIRACLES
BEFORE
HIM
WITH
WHICH
HE
DECEIVED
THEM
THAT
HAD
RECEIVED
THE
MARK
OF
THE
BEAST
AND
THEM
THAT
WORSHIPPED
HIS
IMAGE
THESE
BOTH
WERE
CAST
ALIVE
INTO
A
LAKE
OF
FIRE
BURNING
WITH
BRIMSTONE
AND
THE
REMNANT
WERE
SLAIN
WITH
THE
SWORD
OF
HIM
THAT
SAT
UPON
THE
HORSE
WHICH
SWORD
PROCEEDED
OUT
OF
HIS
MOUTH
AND
ALL
THE
FOWLS
WERE
FILLED
WITH
THEIR
FLESH
AND
I
SAW
AN
ANGEL
COME
DOWN
FROM
HEAVEN
HAVING
THE
KEY
OF
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
AND
A
GREAT
CHAIN
IN
HIS
HAND
AND
HE
LAID
HOLD
ON
THE
DRAGON
THAT
OLD
SERPENT
WHICH
IS
THE
DEVIL
AND
SATAN
AND
BOUND
HIM
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
AND
CAST
HIM
INTO
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
AND
SHUT
HIM
UP
AND
SET
A
SEAL
UPON
HIM
THAT
HE
SHOULD
DECEIVE
THE
NATIONS
NO
MORE
TILL
THE
THOUSAND
YEARS
SHOULD
BE
FULFILLED
AND
AFTER
THAT
HE
MUST
BE
LOOSED
A
LITTLE
SEASON
AND
I
SAW
THRONES
AND
THEY
SAT
UPON
THEM
AND
JUDGMENT
WAS
GIVEN
UNTO
THEM
AND
I
SAW
THE
SOULS
OF
THEM
THAT
WERE
BEHEADED
FOR
THE
WITNESS
OF
JESUS
AND
FOR
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
WHICH
HAD
NOT
WORSHIPPED
THE
BEAST
NEITHER
HIS
IMAGE
NEITHER
HAD
RECEIVED
HIS
MARK
UPON
THEIR
FOREHEADS
OR
IN
THEIR
HANDS
AND
THEY
LIVED
AND
REIGNED
WITH
CHRIST
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
BUT
THE
REST
OF
THE
DEAD
LIVED
NOT
AGAIN
UNTIL
THE
THOUSAND
YEARS
WERE
FINISHED
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
RESURRECTION
BLESSED
AND
HOLY
IS
HE
THAT
HATH
PART
IN
THE
FIRST
RESURRECTION
ON
SUCH
THE
SECOND
DEATH
HATH
NO
POWER
BUT
THEY
SHALL
BE
PRIESTS
OF
GOD
AND
OF
CHRIST
AND
SHALL
REIGN
WITH
HIM
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
AND
WHEN
THE
THOUSAND
YEARS
ARE
EXPIRED
SATAN
SHALL
BE
LOOSED
OUT
OF
HIS
PRISON
AND
SHALL
GO
OUT
TO
DECEIVE
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
ARE
IN
THE
FOUR
QUARTERS
OF
THE

GOG
AND
MAGOG
TO
GATHER
THEM
TOGETHER
TO
BATTLE
THE
NUMBER
OF
WHOM
IS
AS
THE

AND
THEY
WENT
UP
ON
THE
BREADTH
OF
THE

AND
COMPASSED
THE
CAMP
OF
THE
SAINTS
ABOUT
AND
THE
BELOVED
CITY
AND
FIRE
CAME
DOWN
FROM
GOD
OUT
OF

AND
DEVOURED
THEM
AND
THE
DEVIL
THAT
DECEIVED
THEM
WAS
CAST
INTO
THE
LAKE
OF

BRIMSTONE
WHERE
THE
BEAST
AND
THE
FALSE
PROPHET
ARE
AND
SHALL
BE
TORMENTED
DAY

NIGHT
FOR
EVER

AND
I
SAW
A
GREAT
WHITE
THRONE
AND
HIM
THAT
SAT
ON
IT
FROM
WHOSE
FACE
THE
EARTH
AND
THE
HEAVEN
FLED
AWAY
AND
THERE
WAS

NO

AND
I
SAW
THE

GOD
AND
THE
BOOKS
WERE
OPENED
AND
ANOTHER
BOOK
WAS
OPENED
WHICH
IS
THE
BOOK

WERE
JUDGED
OUT

AND
WHOSOEVER

ACCORDING

OF
A
MAN
THAT
