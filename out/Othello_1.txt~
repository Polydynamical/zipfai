By that logic, anyone who ever cancels a pre-order should forefeit the full purchase price. They should pay out of their own pockets to honour the deal with the retailer.

In practice, both sides get flexibility. The customer can always cancel, as can the retailer if they are unable to fulfill the order - especially as in this case it's not even their fault. It may be that Game are already out of pocket depending on contracts, insurance policies, whose lorry it was etc

"You do realize this was a post on a web comic about sex coupons, and not intended as legal advice, right? 

But fuck it, let's dance! First, some definitions:

* A coupon is a voucher entitling the holder to a discount for a particular product.

* A gift certificate is a voucher that is exchangeable for a specified cash value of goods or services.

So assuming the sex coupons in the above comic were meant to be exchanged for sex acts — as opposed to providing a monetary discount on sex acts that cost money, which would make sense in the context of a prostitute/customer relationship but not so much in the context of a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship — they would more accurately be called ""sex certificates,"" and would be applicable under Montana Code Annotated Title 30, Chapter 14, Section 108. 

Further, there is [actually some uncertainty as to wether coupons *are* gift certificates for the purposes of federal and state laws like the one above]( 

If a coupon entitles the holder to a specific dollar discount — for example, ""*$1 off a gallon of milk*"" — then it likely meets the legal definition of a gift certificate and would be covered under those laws. 

If a coupon is variable — for example, ""*25% off the price of a gallon of milk*"" — then it probably doesn't count as a gift certificate. 

But the courts haven't taken a lot of cases regarding this subject, so there's unfortunately some room for debate and confusion."

It is dangerous tho, overdosing, drinking alcohol and working out on that drug can kill you and there's nothing doctors can do when you overdose. It's also harsh on your liver but most people do it for a month and take a break of it for a while to minimize damage. Also you can't sleep the first few night and your head radiates heat.

"We hyphenated because it was important to my husband that we have a single last name as a family, but I really did like my own last name too and didn't want to entirely lose it - partly because I feel like it's one of my last connections to my dad who died when I was 15. Also my dad had only daughters and I know he was a little disappointed that his surname wouldn't be passed on, so this was a nice way to help him out. :)

If my husband had had a preference that I entirely take his name I would have anyway of course, but as soon as I said I'd be a little sad to lose my surname he suggested hyphenation and even offered to put mine first. (We didn't, his is first.) He's really considerate.

I totally agree with him that it's important to a family unit to all have the same surname. It makes everything much easier logistically and more than that, it really makes us feel like a family.

I do agree with others saying this isn't the important thing about a marriage though. All the stuff around getting married... not a huge deal. We spent a few thousand combined on two parties (because our families are from different countries), the rings (heirloom wedding rings, although splurged about 1.5k on my engagement ring), ceremony (my dress was $10!)... and put everything else towards buying furniture and getting together a down payment for a house. The party and showing other people we're married isn't really the big deal. The big deal is building a life together."

You're working under the assumption that furniture is all that burned, when that is very likely not the case.    
    
False. It would NEVER get even close to hot enough to melt steel beams, or even weaken them enough to collapse the whole building in a couple hours. Not to mention all of the steel beams would have been weakened and fail at the same time, in order for the whole building to come down evenly like it did.

"Clearly, I have overestimated the value of this text and the wisdom of its followers. Many of you are cultists who irrationally worship the words of Gurus as infallible in EXACTLY the same way that some Muslims and Christians revere their own totally-human guides.

If ""sakhee"" DOES literally mean ""soul-bride"" -- if that is not a Westernization of the meaning -- than I have simply been mislead by the claims that the original language is ""gender neutral"". That's just a lie people tell themselves, if the husband-bride relationship, with a superior husband, is employed as a primary metaphor for God in your scripture.

And I can change anything I want -- nice try sounding confident and assertive, but your words are empty of truth. You have no more power to define the rules of this reality than a Guru -- which is to say, none whatsoever. The Authority beyond all people invalidates anyone's unenforced claims on what another can do.

Also, I don't think it's only ME who is ""on par"" with your Gurus. EVERY human being is on par with ""Gurus"". And they don't realize it because they make no effort to think for themselves. I've never been impressed by the ""perfection"" of a Guru in my life. The idea that a Guru is ""perfect"" is just childish fantasy, from my point of view. And despite popular belief, Gurus are still humans.

Even YOU could think out the processes and goals by which ""Gurus"" behave if you weren't so close-minded about your own potential. I'll never be subservient to another human being like some sucker. Only the transcendent oneness of reality is beyond human power -- no human is inherently or inevitably superior to any other."

"&gt; Well, if I understood correctly, university will help me with housing, or at least connect me with possible houseowners.

Chances are, however, that these choices are sub-par with respect to location/distance from TU/e or center. On the other hand, once you're in Eindhoven, it is easier finding a better place.

&gt; Well I was thinking about fast learning of Dutch as a possibility but from my recent trip to Amsterdam I figured out that all Dutch people are very fluent in English so it won't be a big deal in first few months.

If you don't make it a habit from the start, I fear you'll never make the effort because English is always easier and everyone you know (at the TU/e) does speak English well.

&gt; Some other questions: How's the atmosphere in the city? Is it really that ""vibrant"" and good for students? I am living in city which is same size as Eindhoven and it always feels kinda empty. 

It depends on what you want. There are a lot of student-organisations for sports, culture, and study. There's a lot of bars/pubs/etc if you're into that kind of thing. On the other hand, especially for an outsider, Eindhoven can be felt as empty as well. There's a lot going on socially, culturally, with design and technology, but most of these initiatives and events probably aren't on the radar of your average (international) students. Go look for it actively and you'll find enough to do.

&gt; Studying on the university - is it exhausting? Do you have at least some free time? How are the lectures?

It is quite theoretical, lots of mathematics, but over-all straightforward and takes not much time beyond classes and exercises. I found it relatively easy, and, to be honest, since the introduction of the Bachelor/Master structure at the TU/e I think it has become easier still.  Luckily, you can easily add extra courses to your curriculum. So you can get the education you want.

"I don't think this is necessary a bad thing. Most pc gamers won't go and suddenly play The Witcher 3 on a console just because the game is released on that platform as well. As long as money can be made of pc gamers the developers won't go anywhere.

 They will go and make games for console too without a doubt, but this is not a bad thing. This will lead to more copies of the game being sold. I love games and I'm glad other people can enjoy these games too, the more the better! And these extra sales will let developers build even bigger and better games. 

As CD Project Red said themself in this eurogamer [interview](

"I went and played with CodeAcademy. I don't like it (or maybe I'm not using it correctly). If it works for you, then go with it, but here are my issues with it. 

It doesn't seem to explain topics very well and for the lessons it hands you too much information telling you exactly what to type. When you screw up the syntax 5 times and then finally get it correct, then you'll really remember it. 

It also does not appear to give you much room to play around with the code as you learn. I have always learned by learning a bit about a language and then playing with that some, then learning a bit more, etc. 

You also don't end up with a collection of programs that you have written as you move through the material. For me that has always been a reference to go back to as I learn a language. With codeacademy you do something, run it, and move on.

"Your mom is absolutely and completely in the wrong. Not only shouldn't she be dragging you into their failed relationship, but she definitely should not be attempting to sabotage your relationship with your father. That is just narcissism to an extreme.

The absolute worst thing you can do is put up with this, which effectively tells her that it is okay. It isn't. You need to make that very clear. You aren't going to hurt her physically by telling her the truth. Just do it in a calm and sensitive way. Something along the lines of:

""Mom, it's not fair that you are trying to come between dad and I. The harder you try to keep us apart, the more you are going to make me resent you and keep me and you apart. I want a healthy and strong relationship with both you and dad. That can't happen with you constantly trashing him to me or getting upset if I spend time with him. You need to move on with your life and forget about him. If you can't do that, then our relationship may need to change for my benefit.""

Then if she doesn't change, make the changes in your life that are best for you. If your mom doesn't like it, she had her chance so that is her problem. "

"Hayley - I was super excited for. I've tried nearly everything: stimshop, aesops, comet, and just a ""good stuff"" style shaper deck. The only thing I haven't really tried is stealth. She's a lot of fun, but none were quite as effective as I would like. I often found myself thinking ""this is good, but would be better in kate"". Ultimately, I've decided to shelve her until after regionals.

Biotech - I'm not sure about the ID as a whole. The tank seems super janky to build for (although it did win me a game against no-breaker noise). I've both tried and played against some shell game/flatline styles, none of which really seemed better than PE. I have yet to see or come up with a list than can effectively pick any of the 3 options.

Greenhouse, OTOH, seems great. I played a greenhouse grail rush deck the day the pack released (before kiv's videos went up, but a similar idea) and found it remarkably effective. Never advance nisei is so powerful, both for the surprise factor and for how it can force a knowledgeable runner to play. I have never played with biotic (I run full grails + elis), and have never really felt I needed it. Caprice ensures that even with a slowish start you can still have a reasonable chance in the late game. Fast track is also really powerful here - I run all 3. The deck has been successful enough even against the better players at my store that I am seriously considering taking it to regionals. The variance is somewhat concerning, though.
